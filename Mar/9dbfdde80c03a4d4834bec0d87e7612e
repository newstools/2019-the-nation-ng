The doubt over Nigeria’s participation at the 2019 African Wrestling Championships holding in Tunisia has been laid to rest as the President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali has confirmed that the country would be represented at the continental showpiece. Prior to yesterday’s confirmation from Igali, there were strong indications that the country would not represented at the African tournament following the unfriendly gesture from the Ministry of Sports. But this doubt has been quenched by the efforts of the federation to ensure that a strong team hoist the country’s flag at the tournament which kicks off on April 26 in Hammamet. According to Igali, it is certain that Nigeria will compete at the continental championship as efforts are on to purchase flight tickets for the athletes. He however, said that from the initial N320,000 budgeted for the ticket of each of the athlete, the fare has jerked up to N.5m following the late purchase of the tickets. Following this development, the NWF boss said that the list would be prune to accommodate the number of athletes that the funds available can catered for at the tournament. Also, the names of the wrestlers that will make the trip would be unveiled today by the federation as the team is expected to depart next week to Tunisia for the championship. NationSport learnt that Nigeria’s participation becomes necessary as the tournament serves as qualifiers for any team hoping to be part of the 2019 World Championship in Bulgaria comes July. Also the ranking points accumulated at the championship would give the wrestlers chance to improve their world rating as the top six ranked wrestlers in each weight category qualify automatically for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. For now Odunayo Adekuoroye remains the only Nigerian wrestler in top six in any weight category in the world as the Ondo State-born athlete is ranked fourth in the women’s 57kg.
