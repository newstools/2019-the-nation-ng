The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has scheduled ruling for 1.30pm on Friday in the no-case submission made by suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Wanter Onnoghen. Onnoghen is being tried for non-declaration of asset, in a six-count charge instituted by the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB). CCT Chairman, Danladi Umar announced, after taking arguments from parties this morning, in relation to the no-case-submission, announced that ruling would be delivered this afternoon. Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN) who argued for Onnoghen, urged the tribunal to discharge and acquit his client on the grounds that the prosecution was unable to establish a prima facie case against him. Awomolo faulted the entire evidence led by the prosecution and exhibits tendered and urged the tribunal to hold that it is not worth it calling on Onoghen to defend himself. He said the entire proceedings have become a nullity because the process leading to the commencement of the trial did not comply with the procedure provided for in the CCB’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 2017. Prosecution lawyer, Aliyu Umar offered a counter-argument and urged the tribunal to reject Onnoghen’s no-case-submission and order him to enter defence. Umar said the prosecution’s case was simple and relates mainly to the defendants failure to declare his assets. He said; “We are not accusing him of having $300m in his accounts. What we are saying is that he failed to declare his assets on his appointment as Justice of Supreme Court and that he operated domiciliary accounts since 2009 and 2010 without declaring them.” Details shortly…
