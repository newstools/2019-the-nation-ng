A former private school  worker was yesterday arraigned before a Lagos High Court for the death of a pupil in 2015. Rukayat Amisu, formerly of Olab Private School, Lagos Island, was said to have sat Aliyah Ahmed, 3,  on a hot water container, which the girl later fell into. The charge against Amisu reads: “That, you Rukayat Amisu, on October 21, 2005, at about 10am, at Olab Private School, 11, Idowu Street, Lagos Island, unlawfully killed one Aliyah Ahmed by negligently allowing her to be burnt by hot water.” Justice Adedayo Akintoye ordered the defendant remanded in prison after she pleaded not guilty to the one-count charge of manslaughter preferred against her. Prosecuting counsel Babatunde Sunmonu alleged that the defendant unlawfully killed Aliyah Ahmed by negligently allowing her to be burnt by hot water. “The defendant negligently sat the little girl on top of a container containing hot water and the child fell inside the hot water,” he said. Justice Akintoye will on March 11 hear the bail application brought by the defendant’s counsel. A. O. Ladipo.
