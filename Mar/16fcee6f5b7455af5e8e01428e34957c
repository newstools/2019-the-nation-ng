A Lagos High Court  yesterday remanded in prison two unemployed men, Ibrahim Wasiu and Saka Waheed, accused of dispossessing passersby of their phones at gunpoint. Justice Adedayo Akintunde made the order after they pleaded not guilty to a four-count charge of conspiracy and armed robbery preferred against them by the Lagos State Government. The judge adjourned till May 13 for hearing. Prosecuting counsel Babatunde Sunmonu told the judge that the defendants committed the offence at about 11:15pm on February 26, last year, at Ogunmuyiwa Street, Itire, Surulere, Lagos. The court heard that the men robbed Chizoba Apugo of his phone while armed with a toy gun and a knife. The defendants also allegedly stole another phone from another complainant, Samuel Afara. “On February 27, 2018, at about 1:20am, at the same Itire area of Lagos, the defendants were caught by the police while in possession of a toy gun,” Sunmonu said. He said the defendants were in possession of the toy gun with the intent to  rob.
