THE absence of the judge yesterday stalled the trial of a senior lawyer, Rickey Tarfa, for  alleged perversion of justice, at a Lagos High Court for the second time in 49 days. The Nation learnt that Justice Adedayo Akintoye was away on a conference with his brother judges in the state. The trial will now resume on March 19. On January 21, the case could not go on because of  Tarfa’s absence. His counsel, Abiodun Owonikoko, SAN, told Justice Akintoye then that his client had left the country for urgent medical attention. He said Tarfa’s condition “was so bad that he had to travel for surgical operations,” and would be away for three months, which lapsed yesterday. EFCC counsel Rotimi Oyedepo confirmed that he received a medical report and a letter from Owonikoko on the issue. Oyedepo, however, wondered why the defendant did not seek leave of court before travelling. Justice Akintoye advised the defence to ensure that Tarfa was in court next time. She said: “I am giving the defendant the benefit of doubt based on the application before the court. He should be in court on the next adjourned date.” Tarfa was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on March 9, 2016, on a 26-count charge of offering gratification to Justices Hyeladzira Nganjiwa and Mohammed Yunusa of the Federal High Court. Upon his arraignment on March 9, 2016 and subsequent re-arraignment on November 16, 2016, Tarfa pleaded not guilty and was granted bail on self-recognition. The EFCC has since closed its case, following which Tarfa opened his defence after the court dismissed his no-case submission he filed.
