A 70-year old woman, Mrs. Anih Priscilla Evelyn, has lamented loss of her son Anih Okwy Kinsley, in the struggle for the actualization of Biafra sovereignty. Evelyn alleged that she last saw her son, member of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, (MASSOB), after a security raid on members in a rally in Enugu state two years ago. Narrating her ordeal to newsmen in Onitsha, the widow said the victim would have been the heir of the family following the death of her husband who also lost his life in the same struggle. She said, “I have the feeling that my son might have met his untimely death during security raid on MASSOB members in the Enugu rally. “It is still vivid in my mind how my son, Kinsley, who is to be the heir apparent since my husband is no more, died in this struggle. “I was told by my younger son, Uchenna, who is also a member of the Movement that Kinsley was in that rally organized to forge a way forward in achieving a Biafra State. “Uchenna told me that Federal Government joint security task force which has been searching for Biafra agitators stormed the scene, shooting and maiming people. “The unlucky ones were killed or arrested with my 34-year old son, Kinsley, was among those arrested but was surprised to hear from him that his elder brother escaped the arrest and for fear of being killed, left Nigeria for his dear life.” The septuagenarian, a native of Amagunze in Nkanu Local Government Council of Enugu state further decried that she had been devastated by the loss of her son. “I now live in penury because my husband is late and Kinsley is nowhere and his siblings are still tender to fend for themselves,” she lamented.
