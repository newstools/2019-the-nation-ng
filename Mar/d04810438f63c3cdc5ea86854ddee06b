Bayern, who had won 13 of their previous 14 league games, cancelled out Lucas Hoeler’s third minute goal with Robert Lewandowski’s 199th Bundesliga goal in the 22nd minute. But the Poland striker’s sensational volley was not enough and he wasted a bagful of golden scoring chances in the second half, including a point blank header, and even hit the woodwork in stoppage time. Bayern are on 61 points, two behind Dortmund whom they will meet next week.
