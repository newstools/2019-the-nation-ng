ONE of the surprises of the just concluded elections was the victory of the candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Ifeanyi Ubah over his more politically illustrious brothers, Chris Uba, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and his elder brother, Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the just concluded senatorial election in Anambra South. Considering the seemingly inconsequential party on whose platform Ifeanyi won the election, many were quick to attribute his victory to his deep pocket. But while money might have played a role like it does in any election, there are indications that other factors were vital in his victory as the senator-elect for Anambra South. For instance while his brothers who contested the seat against him are traders, Ifeanyi is not just a trader but a businessman with many workers from the state on his payroll. This, coupled with his ownership of a football club, lfeanyi Ubah Football club, makes him a darling of many, a factor that must have endeared him to many voters in the state. Remember Jim Nwobodo and how he used his association with Enugu Rangers lnternational in 1979 to win the governorship of the then Anambra State, now Anambra and Enugu states. Political observers believe lfeanyi Ubah is eyeing something much bigger. On Monday, Ifeanyi Ubah attended a dinner meant for serving and Senators-elect of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Although he denied reports that he was planning to cross over to APC, the National Chairman of the ruling party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, was quoted as saying at the occasion that he (Ifeanyi) had become a member of the party and would be formally welcomed into the fold at the appropriate time.
