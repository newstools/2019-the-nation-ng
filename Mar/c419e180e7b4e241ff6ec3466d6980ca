World number one, China’s Fan Zhendong and the most successful European star, Germany’s Timo Boll are among the array of stars campaigning in the $300,000 prize money championship holding at the Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Arena in Doha. Being one of the few ITTF tournaments using the knockout format, the top players are all aiming for ranking points as well as chances to qualify for the end-of-the-year World Tour grand finals. Quadri and Italy-based Olajide Omotayo will be flying Nigeria’s flag in the competition and already the Nigerians have been given a bye to the second round of the preliminary by the organizers based on their global rating. With only the top 16 players seeded into the main draw (first round), Quadri ranked 26th in the world will have to begin his quest for glory from the second stage of the preliminary round to be sure of making it to the main draw. Five events made up of singles and doubles for men and women as well as mixed doubles will be jostled for while Quadri and Omotayo will be campaigning in the men’s singles as the continent flagbearers. For Omotayo, the tournament would help to tune him up for the forthcoming World Championships holding in Budapest, Hungary. “It is clear that most of the players coming to Qatar are likely to be the possible opponents at the World Championships and coming to Qatar Open would help to assess them. Also, it will also help to give direction to my training regime after the competition. I am eager to give my best with the hope to picking some ranking points in Qatar,” Omotayo said. Over 264 players made up of 167 men and 97 women across the globe will compete at the six-day championship which serves off with the two-day preliminary round.
