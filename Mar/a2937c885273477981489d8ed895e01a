The police in Ogun State have arrested two self-acclaimed pastors of God of Possibilities Church, Ibafo, for allegedly killing their brother-in-law, Peter Chukwuyem. The suspects, Chukwuka Stephen, 43, and Ejim Stephen, 39, both brothers, allegedly committed the offence on February 5, but were arrested on February 24. It was gathered that the deceased married the suspects’ elder sister and brought them to live with his family from their village in Delta State. The suspects were said to have converted the frontage of the man’s home at Papa Ibafo to a church, which the deceased found unpleasant and ejected them. As a result, the brothers developed hatred for their sister’s husband and allegedly killed him on his farm on February 5. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said the suspects initially denied committing the crime, but when they were confronted by the man’s children, they confessed. He said: “”Police Commissioner Ahmed Iliyasu has ordered the transfer of the suspects to the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for investigation and prosecution.”
