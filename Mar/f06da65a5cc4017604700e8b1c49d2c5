Air Peace has taken delivery of its third Boeing 777 aircraft. The airline’s latest bird touched down at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, about 3:20pm last Wednesday. It was honoured with a spectacular water salute staged by men of the Fire Service Department of the Federal Airports of Authority of Nigeria, with a crowd of the carrier’s management and staff as well as aviation authorities and airline workers cheering ecstatically. Air Peace said the latest aircraft in its fleet was a big boost for its plans to soon start long-haul flight operations to Sharjah, Dubai, London, Houston, Guangzhou-China, Mumbai and Johannesburg. Addressing reporters shortly after the aircraft marked with registration number 5N-BWI and named “Anuli Peggy Onyema” landed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, Air Peace Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Mr. Allen Onyema said the airline had proved beyond doubt that it was the face of the bright future of the country in the global aviation industry.
