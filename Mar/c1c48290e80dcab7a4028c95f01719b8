Nigeria continues its good run at the ICC U-19 Cricket World Africa Qualifier holding in Namibia with another win over host on Saturday at the Wanderers Cricket Ground, Windhoek. To overcome the Namibians, Nigeria won by 59runs with a date against Kenya today. According to Kuben Pillay, ICC Tournament Director, there are teams that will be regarded as favourites in the ICC Under 19 Cricket World, Africa Qualifier tournament in Namibia, while there are also several dark horses to consider. He said: “Nigeria is one of those sides that can spring a surprise, especially considering the depth of their attack. Young Peter Aho stood out with his nerveless displays with the ball in the Division Two tournament in Potchefstroom last August. He added: “His game would have only improved in the past few months, and he has the happy knack of always taking wickets. Nigeria is also a side that is not afraid of going for it with the bat, and is a cricketing nation on the rise. The ICC official said that Sierra Leone is also showing great promise. “Sierra Leone is another young cricketing nation that is punching above their weight. Their all-round skills have improved significantly, and they are one of the richest fielding units in African junior cricket. But there is more to them than just fielding. As a 13 year-old last year, Haroun Kamara stood out for them. He displays a measure of maturity far beyond his age, and seems unaffected by his growing role in the side. “The biggest surprise package may well be Tanzania, though. At the Potchefstroom tournament, they produced the player of the tournament in Aahil Jasani. He helped himself to 184 runs in the event, including a terrific century against Mozambique,” Pillay added. Also today, Uganda will host Sierra Leone while Tanzania will take on Namibia. The tournament ends on Saturday March 23.
