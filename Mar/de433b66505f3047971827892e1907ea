Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United are not scared of playing the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona at the Camp Nou after drawing the Catalans on Friday. United were originally drawn to play at Barcelona in the first leg, which would have given them the safety net of playing the decisive return at Old Trafford. But with Manchester City due to play their quarter-final second leg against Tottenham at home in the same week, UEFA decided to make United host Barca in the first leg on April 10, after stipulating in advance following advice from local authorities that United and City could not play at home on successive nights. “I’m probably completely different to 99 per cent of managers, as I prefer away last like we had against PSG (in the previous round),” Solskjaer said. After losing 2-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in Manchester, Solskjaer’s side claimed a stunning 3-1 second-leg victory in the French capital to progress to the last eight. “If you can get a decent result at home, then we know we can go away and hurt anyone like we did in Paris,” he added.
