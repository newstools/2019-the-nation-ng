Lagos African Church Grammar School, Ifako, Agege (now Ifako Ijaiye), (LAFROGRAMS) is celebrating its golden jubilee. The school, established in 1969 by the African Church, is rolling out the drums to rejoice. LAFROGRAMS was a force to reckon with in sports, especially in football, in the 70s. The school performed well in the Principals’ Cup, a football competition among government approved secondary schools in those days. Its coach, Kashimawo Laloko, aka Ameh, later became a prominent coach in Nigerian football. LAFROGRAMS also shone brightly in athletics and other sports. In the academic world, the school was and is still known for excellence. The foundation laid by the first head teacher, the late Babatunde Bankole Majekodunmi and consolidated by his successor, the late Oke Osanyintolu, is still being maintained. Since LAFROGRAMS presented its first set of students for the West African School Certificate Examination in 1973, it has been performing well in external examinations. The National President of Lagos African Church Grammar School Old Students Association (LAFROSA), Moses Paul, said: “We the old students of LAFROGRAMS are happy to celebrate our alma mater. “On Thursday, there will be an anniversary lecture, to be followed the next day by a novelty match/cultural day. “The celebration will be rounded off on Sunday with a thanksgiving service at the African Church Cathedral, Ifako, from 10am.”
