The extended recapitalization deadline and re-categorization of Nigeria’s 898 micro-finance banks (MfBs), by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is a tacit admission of their shortcomings, as well as an opportunity to ensure that they live up to their full potential. In a circular released by the apex bank last week, the original deadline for the recapitalization of microfinance banks was moved from 2020 to 2021. National MfBs are required to attain a N5 billion minimum capital base. That for state MfBs is set at N1 billion.  At the very base, Tier 1 Units are expected to rev up their capital to N200 million, while Tier 2 Unit MfBs must have minimum capital base of N50 million. National MfBs are to attain a threshold of N3.5 billion by April 2020 and N5 billion by April 2021.  State MfBs must reach N500 million by April 2020 and N1 billion by April 2021. Tier 1 Unit MfBs must hit N100 million capitalization by April 2020, and N200 million by April 2021; while the Tier 2 MfBs must peak from N35 million in April 2020 to N50 Million capital base by April 2021.  By April 2021, therefore, the least capitalized MfB would boast a capital base of N50 million. The recapitalization and re-categorization exercise is clearly a good thing. Better-capitalized microfinance banks would theoretically be able to perform their functions of grassroots-level financial intervention and intermediation more effectively. The introduction of new categories is aimed at ensuring that the traditionally-neglected rural areas have greater access to banking products and services. However, it is also obvious that recapitalization is an undeniable indication of the fact that MfBs have failed to live up to the high expectations placed upon them. The CBN expected them to cover the majority of the nation’s economically-active poor citizens by 2020; to increase the micro-credit’s share of total credit to the economy from 0.9 per cent in 2005 to at least 20 per cent by 2020; to ensure that at least two-thirds of state and local governments participate in micro-credit financing by 2015; and to help the nation attain the 80 per cent financial inclusion target set by the CBN which currently stands at a little above 50 per cent. Far too many micro-finance banks are plagued by poor management structures, weak internal controls and an overall lack of institutional capacity. Indeed, instead of filling the gap left by the nation’s commercial banks, many of them have in fact widened it. The outrageously high-interest rates charged by MfBs rival those of their commercial counterparts. In September 2018, the CBN revoked the licenses of 154 MfBs, explaining that 62 had already folded up, while 73 were insolvent, 11 terminally distressed, and five had filed for voluntary liquidation. If micro-finance banks are to make the positive impact desired of them, they must be better-regulated. The CBN must enhance its capacity to properly monitor them and ensure that they are staffed by competent managers and run in accordance with laid-down banking principles. It is particularly important that the MfBs resist the temptation to operate as mini-commercial banks.  That is often the main reason so many find themselves in financial trouble. The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) paid N2.9 billion to 81,328 insured depositors in failed MfBs in December 2015. The Corporation claims to have settled over 525,009 MfB depositors, as at September 2017. Nigeria’s micro-finance banks, for their own part, must understand that the administrative standards they should adhere to are as stringent as those prescribed for commercial banks. Competence, trust and integrity are non-negotiable requirements of any successful banking operation. They must plan for the long-term, stick to prescribed rules and regulations, and avoid the temptation to cut corners. The better they are able to do this, the sooner their positive impact will be felt across the nation.
