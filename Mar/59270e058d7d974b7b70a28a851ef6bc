The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1 on Friday urged people to go out en-mass and vote for candidates of their choice without any fear of molestation and intimidation. The monarch also charged the people to eschew violence as they cast their votes for the candidate of their choice in tomorrowâ€™s gubernatorial and state house of assembly elections Oba Adetunji, in a statement by his Personal Assistant/Director of Media and Public Affairs, Mr. Adeola Oloko in Ibadan, also stated that improper conduct at the polls by critical stakeholders is an ill-wind that would blow no one any good. He listed the critical stakeholders as the generality of people including the electorate, the politicians, the electoral umpire and the law enforcement agents. According to him, in a contest of more than one person, only an individual would win. He further stated if the contest produces a winner, the winner should be magnanimous in victory, while the loser should be gallant in defeat. The Olubadan stated the ambition of any public office seeker is not worth the blood of innocent Nigerians, warning anyone who has no business with the polling centre should keep away from it for the sake of peace.
