 Didier Drogba’s 41st birthday caused Chelsea fans to wish for the striker’s return on the pitch. The Blues legend, who won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with the club, was present as his former club rescued a late draw against Wolves. They had fallen behind to Raul Jimenez’s strike, but Eden Hazard earned a point with a 92nd-minute leveler. The toothless attacking display from the hosts had fans lamenting the retirement of the big striker. One fan felt Chelsea’s current attacking options paled in comparison to Drogba’s ability at the peak of his powers, and said: ‘Then see what we have now…’ Yet another said “We can never have a striker like this again” Drogba spent eight seasons at Stamford Bridge between 2004 and 2011, before returning for a Premier League-winning campaign in 2014. In total, Drogba managed 164 goals in 381 appearances for the club, cementing his reputation as a legendary figure for his role in the 2012 Champions League triumph. At the national level Drogba contributed to the Ivory Coast to qualify for its first ever FIFA World Cup, held in Germany in 2006. In February 2006, Drogba captained the Ivory Coast to their second Africa Cup of Nations final, scoring the only goal in their semi-final match with Nigeria and putting away the deciding spot-kick in their record-tying 12–11 penalty shootout quarter-final win over Cameroon. However, they lost in the final to Egypt 4–2 on penalty kicks after a 0–0 draw, with Drogba’s shot being stopped by Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary. He was not only a fighter on the pitch but was a motivator in chief for the Elephants. The former Marseille ace made over 105 appearances for the Elephants scoring 65 goals.
