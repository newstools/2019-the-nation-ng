The Super Eagles defeated the Pirates of Seychelles 3-1 in their final qualifying match of the 2019 African Cup of Nations played yesterday at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, Delta State. Goals from Odion Ighalo, Henry Onyekuru and substitute Moses Simon helped the Nigerian team defeat the underdogs in yesterday’s clash. Being well-placed at the top of the log, Gernot Rohr’s men came into the clash as huge favourites but showed less than what was expected of them in the first 45 minutes of the game. Odion Ighalo scored the opener for the Eagles via a spot kick in the 35th minute after Wilfred Ndidi was brought down in the Seychelles box. The Pirates then benefitted from a howler from Nigeria’s goalkeeper Francis Uzoho who failed to effectively punch a cross, to snatch an equaliser through Rody Melanie’s strike in the 41st minute. The Eagles came back better in the second-half and just five minutes after the restart, went into the lead through a header from Henry Onyekuru. The Galatasaray forward nodded into the net from a Jamilu Collins cross to send his effort past the Seychelles goalkeeper from close range. Moses Simon, who was introduced late in the second period, put the icing in the cake for the Eagles with a pin point strike in the box on the stroke of 90 minutes. The winger picked up a pass from Collins, twisted and turned, before blasting in at the near post for the Eagles third. Nigeria thus finish Group E as winners with an unassailable 13 points regardless of the outcome of Monday’s game between group mates Libya and South Africa. The Eagles will now have their attention turned to an international friendly against AFCON hosts Egypt on Tuesday.
