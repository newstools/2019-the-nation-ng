Georgia Oboh is not relenting on her ambition of becoming the LET Rookie of the Year, in spite of not starting well. From today, the 18-year-old Edo State-born golf sensation will compete in her second LET tournament at the Women’s NSW Open holding at Queanbeyan Golf Club in Australia. The unassuming golfer told NationSport from Australia yesterday that she takes positives from her shortcomings. “I am not worried about my performance so far this season, I see this as a stepping stone to greater things, it’s a learning experience and I’ve learnt many lessons so far and I plan to apply those lessons in the coming weeks. “My target will be LET Rookie of the Year, to play in the British Ladies Open and the Evian Championships, and to attain full membership status on the LET,” she said. She described some of her challenges as a learning curve. “Some of the major challenges I’m having is definitely an experience, the courses I’m playing are new to me but at the same time I can only put the work in and leave the rest to God. I intend to overcome these challenges by praying and by practising and having the patience to make the right decisions at the right time. By putting more work into my golf game and having the grace of God to play more tournaments and patience. For 2019, the former World Teen Champion, said she hopes to make the top 500 in the world.
