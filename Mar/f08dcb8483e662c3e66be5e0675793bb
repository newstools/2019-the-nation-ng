The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has dismissed claims that its Governor, Godwin Emefiele has been sacked. Responding to enquiries from The Nation yesterday  on the purported sack of the CBN chief by an online medium, its Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor, said nothing can be farther from the truth. “The governor is in his office working.” Another CBN official said:  “There is nothing like that, the governor is here, his tenure expires in June. In fact he has functions to attend to tomorrow, one of which is to meet with stakeholders in the cotton value chain on Tuesday March 5, (today).” An online medium had reported yesterday afternoon that the CBN governor has been sacked by the Presidency and given two weeks to clear his table and “handover to an unnamed successor.”
