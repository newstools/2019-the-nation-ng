The very tense political battle which pitched former loyalists, including Governor Samuel Ortom is drawing to a close with Ortom’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leading in results declared on Sunday. At the Collation Centre in INEC office, Makurdi where collation of results from the state’s 23 local government areas began around 3 pm on Sunday, only results from 11 LGAs had been announced by 6.30 pm. The two lawyers representing the PDP and the APC as party agents emphatically attacked one another’s positions over the cancelled votes in some local government areas. Citing likely non-use of card readers in Ortom’s Guma LGA where PDP recorded 28, 475 to APC’s 8, 869 votes, the APC agent called for complete dismissal of the results but the PDP agent asserted that such would contradict INEC guidelines and the law. The duo had argued over declaring whichever candidate wins one quarter of votes in two-thirds of the 23 local government areas as winner, even with simple majority without regard for votes in cancelled wards. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda, explained the inevitability of cancellation of results in some wards, noting that non-use of smart card readers and over-voting account for several of such cases. “We have a case of an attack by people who burnt down materials at Mbalon ward which has ten polling units and 5, 906 registered voters. “At Yandev North, just before 8 am on election Day, there was another attack that affected materials for nine polling units; the staff were rescued, attacked again before more security was arranged for them to conduct the election. “In Ukum LGA,, result sheets from a ward was burnt, except for that of one political party and we stepped down all the results from the ward. “In Konshisha LGA, there was a similar attack and we stepped down the results,” he said.
