The Bayelsa State government has said it would complete repayment of the N50 billion bond obtained by the former administration of Chief Timipre Sylva in June. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, said it was part of the major resolutions reached at the State Executive Council meeting. In a statement by the governor’s media aide, Fidelis Soriwei, Iworiso-Markson noted that when completed, funds currently being used to service the bond would be channelled towards finishing key ongoing projects. The commissioner, who listed the priority projects to include the Sagbama-Ekeremor Road, Yenagoa-Oporoma Road and Ayama/Ogbia-Okodi Road, said the government has worked out funding modalities in its bid to expedite work on the projects. According to him, the council reaffirmed the present administration’s resolve to bequeath legacies for successive governments to build on and for the state’s development. He said: “We are determined to finish well and strong. Going by the resolutions reached in Council, it is clear that this government will deliver optimally to Bayelsans. “Our resolve is that Bayelsans, at the end of the day, will judge this government by the footprint it has been able to establish. Everything we’ve done from day one to this moment is a testament to our resolve to leave a lasting legacy that even successive governments will follow.” Expatiating on the funding modalities, the Commissioner for Finance, Maxwell Ebibai, said the government was expanding the “Contractor Infrastructure Development Finance Scheme”, a model which was used in financing other critical infrastructural projects. Under the scheme, he said contractors were empowered to borrow funds from financial institutions to execute projects and present their certificates of work done to government for repayment. Ebibai noted that the model helped to check slow pace or outright abandonment in the execution of government projects.
