An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded in prison Ikechukwu Ozurumba, who was charged with killing a taxi driver. Magistrate O. O. Oshin‘s order followed Ozurumba’s arraignment by the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), Adeniji-Adele, Lagos. Ozurumba, 29, and Chima Chukwuemeka, 34, were arraigned on a five-count charge of murder, theft and accessory after the fact. They were also accused of stealing the taxi driver’s Toyota Camry car valued at N1.5 million. Prosecuting counsel A. O. Fadipe alleged that the duo committed the offence last December 26 in Festac Town and Okokomaiko, Lagos. He said Ozurumba, conspired with one Kelechi (aka Sunshine), still at large, and killed a Taxify driver, Olufemi Ebenezer. Fadipe alleged that they hit Ebenezer, who hailed from Akoko in Ondo State, with tools, resulting in his death. He said Ozurumba dumped the body at Jimoh Street, Okokomaiko, Lagos. The prosecutor said the defendant also made away with the victim’s car marked SMK-980 FM. He said the second Chukwuemeka, “with the knowledge that the first defendant committed an offence, accommodated him, to prevent his arrest by the police.” The offences also violate Section 233 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Ozurumba’s plea was not taken, because the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the charge. But Chukwuemeka pleaded not guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact. The defendants’ counsel, Mr. Francis Agaoro, prayed the court to grant Chukwuemeka bail, because the charge “is a bailable offence.” But Fadipe prayed the court to remand the defendants. He said Chukwuemeka was charged under the Robbery and Firearms Act, which falls under the jurisdiction of the high court. Ruling, Magistrate Oshin remanded Ozurumba, pending advice by Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) and granted Chukwuemeka N250, 000 bail. The case continues on May 28.
