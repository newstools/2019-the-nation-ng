Following her taking off her underwear on an Instagram live video over the weekend, actress Etinosa Idemudia, has come out to assure her fans that she is doing okay. “Thanks to all who reached out,” she said. “I’m ok. Sometimes dealing with issues can be tough. You feel the weight on you all by yourself and you want to explode. You want to give up. While some handle it with prayers, others handle it in other ways which may or may not be accepted by the society. I made a mistake I do not ever wish to repeat. No man is perfect but we must continue to strive for perfection. The big blunder has occurred and I would love to move on, me, my pot belly and rest of my beautiful body.” This is coming after being dissed by her followers for going nude on MC Galaxy’s Instagram video. Following his usual Friday tradition, MC Galaxy, did an Instagram live video with fans and Idemudia told viewers on that she wanted to exhibit her body.
