The Court of Appeal in Lagos has set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court which voided the nomination of Senator Ayogu Eze as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu State. The appellate court, in a unanimous judgment of a three-man panel, allowed the appeal by Eze and proceeded to affirm him as the rightfully nominated candidate to represent the party in the election scheduled for March 9 this year. Justice Abdul Aboki, in the lead judgment, set aside the judgment of Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace Eze with Barrister George Ogara as the APC governorship candidate for the APC in Enugu State. In setting aside the judgment by Justice Ekwo, Justice Aboki said the suit filed at the Federal High Court was, as at the time of the judgment, statute barred and not competent in law, having been filed outside the mandatory 14 days provided under Section 285(9) of the Constitution. Justice Aboki said the suit filed by Ogara at the Federal High Court, was caught by the Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution, which makes it mandatory for all pre – election cases to be filed within 14 days of the accrual of the cause of action. Justice Aboki noted that the originating processes in this case were filed, at the trial court, more than 32 clear days after the party’s primaries, conducted on October 4, 2018 thereby rendering the suit a mere academic exercise. He said Ogara’s failure to file his suit within 14 days has offended Section 285 of the Constitution, which invariably takes away the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and thereby rendered that suit statute barred. The judge said that “whatever right the respondent may have in his suit has been extinguished by law” and therefore has no right to benefit any longer from the case. He then set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court, in which INEC was ordered to remove Senator Eze’s name from its list of candidates for the governorship election in Enugu State.
