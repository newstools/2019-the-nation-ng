An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr. T.O.S. Gbadeyan, has congratulated the governor-elect of Kwara State, Alhaji AbdulRahaman AbdulRazak, his running mate, Mr.Lekan Alabi, and other victors in the recent elections in the state. Gbadeyan described their emergence as a new dawn in the annals of the state. He prayed that their tenure ”change everything for better”  in the lives of the people that elected them. He asked them to remember to bring smiles to the faces of pensioners who, for the 11th year running, have been involved in a legal tussle to get paid their pensions and gratuities that were illegally deducted by the state government. He pleaded with the incoming administration to “expeditiously set up a committee that will consider the plight of the pensioners that needlessly fight for their pension rights in the court of law and recommend agreeable terms of settlement that will put an end to such legal tussles.”
