National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kaduna has granted Senator Shehu Sani’s request to inspect the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’s collation result sheets for Kaduna Central Senatorial zone. The Nation recalled that, the sitting Senator Shehu Sani who contested the February 23 Senate election under the platform of People’s Redemption Party (PRP), lost to Uba Sani of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Senator and his party thereafter rejected the result and resolved to challenge it in the court. The tribunal Chairman, Justice A. H Suleiman granted Senator Sani’s request contained in an ex parte motion he filed alongside PRP. In their petition No. EPT/KD/SN/M/02/19, the applications asked INEC, to make results sheets and incident forms available to them for inspection. Ruling of an ex-parte motion, Justice Suleiman said: “An order is hereby made compelling the 3rd Respondent (INEC) to allow the petitioners/applicants or their agents or assigns access to inspect documents (Form EC8A, Eze INEC incident forms) and result sheets of all polling units in the seven Local government Areas that make up Kaduna Central Senatorial district.” “An order is hereby also made on the 3rd Respondent to make available to the petitioners/Applicants certified True Copy of all the documents,” he ruled.
