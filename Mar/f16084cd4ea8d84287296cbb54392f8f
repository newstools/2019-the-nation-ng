The police in Lagos have arrested two suspected members of an armed robbery syndicate terrorising Lekki. Adebayo Ayomide, and Isaac David were arrested by a team of operatives led by Maroko Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Isah Abdulmajid, a Chief Superintendent (CSP) shortly after allegedly robbing two residents of phones. In a statement released Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the suspects were apprehended on March 9 around 9pm. He said the DPO and his men while on crime prevention patrol along the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge came in contact with two young women, Gbemi and Hannah, who appeared to be in panic. “Upon questioning, they explained to the team that they had just been dispossessed of their phones by the suspects at gunpoint. They pointed at the direction through which the bandits escaped on a motorcycle and the police gave them a hot chase. “The team tracked down the suspects and upon searching them, their operational single-barrel gun, a cutlass and the phones were found on them. The items were recovered and the criminals taken into custody. “In their confessional statements, they owned up to belonging to a syndicate terrorising Lekki and its environs. “Commending the police team for a swift response to the crime and the eventual arrest of the perpetrators, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Zubairu Muazu directed that the case be transferred to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for further investigation. “The CP assured residents of the command’s commitment to securing lives and property in every nook and cranny of the state. He warned criminal-minded individuals to either change their ways or face the full weight of the law.”
