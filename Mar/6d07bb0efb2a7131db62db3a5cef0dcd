One person has died and two others injured in a street fight in a community in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. The Nation correspondent gathered Thursday that the incident happened at the Jambutu area of Yola North Local Government Area Tuesday night during a clash among youths returning home from a party. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Othman Abubakar, who confirmed the incident, named the deceased as John Jada. “Youths returning from a night outing engaged each other in a fight at Rumde Baru in Jambutu. One John Jada was fatally wounded and he later died,” the PPRO said. He added that two people who were wounded had been taken to hospital while the police arrested three people over the fight, namely Shamsudeen Abubakar,  Aliyu Musa and Muhammed Abba. The incident came against reduced criminal activities across Adamawa State. The state has been relatively crime-free since the election season began about two weeks ago, something which a security personnel recently described as a direct result of the political engagements. The personnel said, “The cime-minded ones as well as the law abiding ones around the state have been engaged by our politicians. They have no idle time to get to mischief. That’s why the state has been resting from issues of crime.”
