Rockland County, on the Hudson River north of New York City, has declared a state of emergency following a severe outbreak of measles. The County has barred unvaccinated children from public spaces after 153 cases were confirmed. Violating the order will attract a fine of $500 (£378) and up to six months imprisonment. The announcement follows other outbreaks in Washington, California, Texas and Illinois. Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons, or because they believe misleading information that vaccines cause autism in children. “We will not sit idly while children in our community are at risk. This is a public health crisis and it is time to sound the alarm,” Rockland County Executive Ed Day said. The outbreak in Rockland County is largely concentrated in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. It is believed it could have spread from other predominantly ultra-Orthodox areas around New York which have already seen outbreaks of measles. Mr. Day said health inspectors had encountered “resistance” from some local residents, which he branded “unacceptable and irresponsible”.
