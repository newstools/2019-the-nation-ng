For Africa to build a more viable economy which will ultimately turn the continent into a technology driven knowledge-based economy, it must embrace digitilisation, a technology firm, Computer Warehouse Group (CWG) Plc, has said. Its Ag. CEO/MD, Mr Adewale Adeyipo who joined other leaders at the 7th Africa CEOs Forum, in Kigali, Rwanda, advocated for an inclusive ecosystem that can aid technological development on the continent, adding that Africa’s labour market is currently being disrupted as over 65 per cent of primary school children today are likely to work in the next few years in jobs or fields that do not presently exist. He said: “Africa is rapidly becoming consumer of digital services rather than creators in today’s digital economy and to change this scenario, we need to rethink the existing model and build a sustainable digital ecosystem and as well create more digital champions for our children of today.” Speaking further, Adeyipo urged the continent to create broader awareness about the deployment of a digital economy that can follow the ‘Integrated design approach’ to bring together specialisms usually considered separately. A report by the GSMA Intelligence Report, 2018, shows that the mobile economy in Africa will generate more than $150 billion (or 7.9 per cent of GDP) of economic value while 300 million people are expected to come online by 2025. “The question then is; would all these be enough for Africa to be ready?” he asked rhetorically. The Africa CEO Forum is the leading international conference dedicated to the private sector in Africa and hosts the continent’s top CEOs, international investors, experts and high-level policymakers every year with ability to mobilise, offer cutting-edge content and is committed to unlocking Africa’s economic potential by championing private sector-led growth, leading discussions around innovative public policies and sustainable business.
