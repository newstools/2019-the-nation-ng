The Lagos State government said it will restore sanity onto the roads by clamping down on motorists, tri-cyclists and motor cycle riders who make use of the highways without recourse to the state traffic laws. Speaking at an event organised by Africa’s mobile phone giant, itel Mobile, for Keke NAPEP riders at Ikeja at the weekend, the Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Mr Chris Olakpe (rtd), said the elections are over and work has resumed full steam. He said the agency decided to slow down to allow for smooth conduct of the elections, adding that now that the elections are over, LASTMA and other law enforcement agencies connected with road transportation in the state will return to work. “We will begin serious enforcement; abuse of drugs too will be dealt with. LASTMA will work with the police and NDLEA to flush people selling drugs at motor parks out,” Olakpe said. Also speaking on the occasion, General Manager, Transsion Holding, Chidi Okonkwo, Transsion said the firm decided to use Keke Napep riders as launch pad to kick-start safe driving campaign. He said the initiative was in keeping with the firm’s drive to prioritise its community’s needs under the CSR initiative: Love Always On, and reduce problem that has resulted from misuse of mobile technology. He lamented that mobile phone use while driving in Nigeria was on the increase, warning that the practice exposes driver four times to risk of accident. “When there is a crash, the life of passengers and drivers are at risk.
