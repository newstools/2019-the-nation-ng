YORUBA actor Eniola Olaniyan, who relocated from Lagos, was spotted at the Silverbird Cinema, Abuja for the movie ‘Modorisa’ by Kemi Afolabi. Olaniyan who has been off the radar for a while, said in a video with Kemi Afolabi that he was with his daughter at the cinema to watch the movie. “This is a special movie, a new epic movie that has an all-female cast,” he said. “It teaches the value of our culture, the movie is a good one.” Before he left Lagos, Olaniyan, a graduate of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, said in an interview that he regrets that stardom has not been able to translate into wealth for him. Eniola worked with Nigeria Meteorological Department at Oshodi, Lagos for several years before relocating to Abuja.
