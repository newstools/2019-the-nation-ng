Lagos State Gubernatorial Candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) Owolabi Salis has rejected last Saturday’s governorship poll, alleging various irregularities. Salis spoke at a press conference at his residence on Tuesday. Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared winner of the election by the Returning Officer of INEC in the state Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede. He polled a total of 739, 445 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Jimi Agbaje who got 206,141 votes while Salis polled a total of 3,370 votes. “I am not accepting the results of the last Saturday gubernatorial election as it is complete fraud on the people of Lagos State,” the AD candidate declared. He alleged the election was marred with “multiple voting, intimidation, and collation fraud.” According to him:  “The election is full of many machinations as many voters were intimidated and lot of multiple voting occurred in many polling units. “The collation fraud was huge as the ruling party did everything to discredit the candidate of AD and relegate us by putting us in the sixth position”. He alleged all the votes of the party were counted along with those of other parties at the collation centres, adding that the act was done in connivance with Police and ad hoc staff. “I do not believe Sanwo-Olu won a clear contest. I am going to court. I have overwhelming evidence and will get lawyers that handle electoral matters to look into these irregularities committed against my party in the just concluded election”, he said. “It is very easy to win the case when you have enough evidence. We will follow the matter to a logical conclusion and we believe we will get justice,” Salis said. Salis vowed he would still remain relevant politically and not relent in advancing the course of the less privileged in the society.
