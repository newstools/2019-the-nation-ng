VETERAN filmmaker Tunde Kelani has joined the league of global filmmakers who are using their smartphones for their film productions. At the ongoing iREP International Documentary Film Festival, Kelani screened his latest collaborative effort with Bola Bello ‘Yoruba Without Border’ which was shot with two smartphones. Known for his insatiable desire for knowledge, Kelani after stumbling on American film Director Steven Soderberg’s ‘Unsane’ film shot with an iPhone, read extensively on how to use a smartphone to shoot a film. The result of that research was stunning visuals that clearly interprets the storylines of his documentary. The filmmakers further revealed that the film was shot over a week and two days while post-production took about six weeks. “The phone, today, is more than just a tool for communication. Once you are familiar with the gadgetry, you can use it for your film and nowadays almost all the softwares found on the camera is available on a smartphone,” said Kelani. ‘Yoruba Without Border’ traces Yorubas living in Port Novo, Republic of Benin and celebrates their cultural heritage. The film also touched on how the language blurs the seeming borders and promote humanity. This year marks the ninth edition of iREP which over the years has celebrated the less glamorous film genre.
