Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has congratulated Governor-elect Babajide Sanwo-Olu on his victory in the last Saturday election. In a statement  by its spokesman, Mr Taofik Gani, the PDP stated that the congratulate message “is to exhibit good spirit of sportsmanship and show respect for the laws of the land.” The party, however, stated that if for any reason it has to challenge the result announced it shall not hesitate to do so. It advised the Governor-elect to eschew any iota of politics of retaliation, seclusion or vendetta. The party also cautioned Sanwo-Olu against going after Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, unless if it must be done for the development of the state because Lagosians will not accept any excuse for any failure in governance as a result of self inflicted distraction.
