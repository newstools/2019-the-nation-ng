The Presidential Election Tribunal has acceded to the request by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the last presidential election, Atiku Abubakar for permission to serve their petition of President Muhammadu Buhari through his party, All Progressives Congress (APC). PDP and Atiku, who, by the petition they filed earlier this month, are challenging Buhari’s victory at the election, applied for leave to effect service of the petition on the President on the grounds that they were having difficulty serving him personally. On Wednesday, the three-man tribunal, after to listening Chris Uche (SAN) who moved the ex-parte filed by the petitioners, granted them permission to serve through substituted means. Justice Abdul Aboki, who led the panel, ordered that Buhari, who is the second respondent to the petition, be served through any senior official or an officer of the APC at the party’s secretariat in Abuja. Justice Aboki, in his lead ruling, said “it is in the interest of justice” to grant the prayers in the petitioners’ motion.
