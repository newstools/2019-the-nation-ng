An Abuja-based Islamic Cleric, Sheikh Yahya Al-Yolawi, has advised Muslims to cultivate the habit of visiting the graveyard to remember and prepare for life after death. Al-Yolawi, who is also the Chief Imam of Area 10 Garki Mosque in Abuja, gave the advice while delivering Jumma’at Sermon entitled “ Benefits of Remembering Death in Islam” on Friday in Abuja. The cleric explained that regular visit to graveyard would enable Muslims to prepare toward death before it was too late, adding that remembering death would reduce worldly materials’ inclination from hearts. According to Al-Yolawi, death is a reality in which all human beings accept and believe in but it is also a reality which most people like to keep out of their minds. He added that “in Islam, death is not an end to our existence; it is a passage, which takes us from this world to the next stage of life (grave) then to hereafter.

Muslims Success or failure at the time of death depends largely on how much he prepared before that day. “ Preparing for death is a lifetime assignment which begins on the day one reach the age of adolescence, where
he will be responsible for his deeds for the rest of his or her life. “ Once death arrives, the opportunity to do well or worship ends and it will be too late to repent and our final
destination depends largely on the kind of beliefs and actions exhibited in this present life. “ Al-Yolawi said any person who chooses to forget or rule out remembering death in his day-to-day life would
find it difficult to repent his or her sins and devil would have total power over him. The cleric, therefore, admonished Muslims to inculcate the spirit of humility and humbleness in dealing with
people irrespective of their religion or tribal background. Al-Yolawi also urged Muslims to be contented with whatever little they have, shun egotism and
oppression of the less privilege. NAN
