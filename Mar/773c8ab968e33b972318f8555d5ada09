The 2019 election petition tribunal began sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, to begin considerations of various petitions arising from the conduct of the 2019 national and state legislative elections. Already, the candidates of the Advanced People’s Democratic Alliance (APDA), Azibataman Johnbull, filed a petition challenging the declaration of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Mieteme Obodor, as the winner of the House of Assembly election in Ogbia Constituency 1. Johnbull earlier applied to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the certified true copies of results from the entire Ward 13, where he alleged that irregularities took place during the election. He alleged that army personnel attached to former President Goodluck Jonathan were involved in the malpractices. The tribunal also received from the APC candidate for Bayelsa Central senatorial district, Mr. Festus Dumeibi, against the PDP candidate, Douye Diri. Petitions were further received from the APC candidate for state House of Assembly candidates, Dr. Selekaye Victor-Ben (Constituency 4, Southern Ijaw), Leskey Ikengs (Southern Ijaw Constituency 4), Nathan Aggro (Yenagoa constituency 1) and Mrs. Caroline Jack (Yenagoa 3). The Speaker of the State House of Assembly and candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency also filed a petition against the electoral victory of Preye Oseke of the APC. Petition came from Mrs. Marie Ebikake of the PDP against the victory of Israel Sunny-Goli of the APC who was declared winner of the Nembe/Brass federal constituency. In a related development, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has issued certificates of return to 23 members-elect of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly. The State Resident Electoral Commissioner of INEC, Pastor Monday Udoh-Tom, while presenting the certificates return urged them to be better representatives to their constituency.
