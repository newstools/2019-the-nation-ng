An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure yesterday sentenced Seidu Adeyemi to death by hanging for killing Miss Khadijat Oluboyo, the first daughter of former Ondo State Deputy Governor Lasisi Oluboyo. Adeyemi was charged with killing his girlfriend, Khadijat, on July 2, 2018. He buried her inside his room at Aratusi, Oke-Aro, Akure. Khadijat was a final year student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko (AAUA). Justice Samuel Bola held that the prosecutor and the government’s counsel had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Adeyemi actually committed the offence he was charged with. The convict, a graduate of Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), was arrested by the police command last July for allegedly killing the former deputy governor’s daughter for money ritual at his home in Akure and burying her in his room for six days. Justice Bola said the convict had committed a capital offence and should die by hanging. The leader of the prosecution team, Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Kola Olawoye, expressed delight over the judgement. He, however, described the circumstances leading to the death as unfortunate. Olawoye said the government was interested in the case because of the circumstances leading to the death of Khadijat, adding that the judgment would deter others.
