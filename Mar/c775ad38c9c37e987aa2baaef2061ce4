China-based Super Eagles forward, Odion has said that Super Eagles clash with Egypt is good preparation for the team ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Shanghai Shenhua striker believes the games will help the team tremendously as they prepare for the tournament. “We are in a good direction, we just want to continue to work hard together as a team, not to feel relaxed just because we have gotten the ticket to the AFCON,” Ighalo said. “It’s one thing to qualify and it’s another thing to go there and perform and that is what we want to do.” He added that “We want to compete, we want to do better than what the Eagles before us have done in the past, I just want us to keep the concentration level high, and who knows – everything is possible.”
