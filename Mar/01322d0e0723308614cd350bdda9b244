The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that it would not join issues with the Governor of Bauchi State, Mohammed Abubakar over the commission’s decision resume collation of election results. The commission said it would rather wait for the judicial process to take its full course. INEC had cancelled polls in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area following some disruption of polls by some thugs on the 23rd February governorship and State Assembly poll in the state, forcing the commission to declare the elections inconclusive. However, following the commission’s investigation of the issue, it decided to continue the electoral process, which according to the commission will commence on Tuesday. Governor Abubakar has approached the court to challenge INEC’s decision to reverse itself. But the commission said it was not going to react to the comment of the Governor over the issue since the case is in the court. INEC National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education, Festus Okoye said it would be better not to comment on the issue. Okoye stressed that the commission would rather allow the judicial process run its full course. He said: “Since the matter is already in court, It is better to allow the judicial process run its full course.” “I would not want to say anything that would amount to pre-empt the court,” he added. He also noted that it would not be the best to discuss the issue on the pages of newspapers.
