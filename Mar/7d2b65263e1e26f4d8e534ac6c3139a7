The Ohaneze Ndigbo Youth Wing has congratulated governors-elect in the South Eastern states for their reelection victory in the just concluded elections. The group in a statement on Thursday made available to journalists in Awka, urged the governors-elect to ensure they fulfil their campaign promises particularly in accommodating the youths. The statement, signed by the group’s President, Dr. Arthur Uchenna-Obiorah, also called on those that lost to accept the outcome in good faith and avoid unnecessary litigations. He said, “We congratulate the governors of Enugu State Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Abia, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, Delta, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa and Ebonyi David Umahi on their reelections.” “The governors-elect should give more political appointments to the youths because they are the bedrock of meaningful development in any promising society. “Those who lost at the polls should not go into unnecessary litigations, but see the outcome of the elections as true reflection of the people’s political decision.” Uchenna-Obiorah however described as worrisome the declaration of the governorship election in six states by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as inconclusive. He particularly expressed concern over the situation in Rivers State, calling for proper investigation of the roles of some security agents in the election. He also urged the INEC and security agencies to follow due process in concluding all inconclusive elections.
