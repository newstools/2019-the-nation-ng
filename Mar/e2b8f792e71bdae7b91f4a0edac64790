A mob yesterday lynched a suspected ritualist at Akenfa, a suburb of Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. He was reportedly caught while trying to cut the body of a young woman he was accused of killing. It was gathered that the woman, identified as Best, an indigene of Epie, was killed by the suspect. The community has come under attack by ritualists, who kill women and remove their body parts. Sources said the suspect threatened to attack the mob with an axe when he was caught, but he was overpowered and burnt to death. The Nation learnt that the man pretended to be mentally-deranged during the day, but turned to a killer at night. A source, who spoke in confidence, said: “That was the man that had been killing women at Akenfa. They caught him once when he was trying to kill another woman. I think that was last month. They beat him up but did not hand him over to the police. “He said he would still kill. This morning, he killed one Epie woman. They caught him when he was killing the woman with an axe. That was the third woman he had killed so far.” Confirming the incident, police spokesman Asinim Butswat said the suspected ritualist and the women he killed were mentally deranged. A human rights activist and gender advocate, Princess Elizabeth Egbe, lamented the spate of ritual killings in the community. She said: “There have been a lot of killings at Akenfa recently. The victims were mainly women. The killers always remove parts such as breast, brain, private parts, eyes, etc. They also remove panties and bra. “As a human rights activist/gender advocate, I strongly condemn these killings and call on the perpetrators to desist from this barbaric, inhuman and ungodly act. It is violence against women. “We urge the government to tighten security.”
