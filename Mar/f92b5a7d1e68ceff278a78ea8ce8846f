An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded Emmanuel Abdon, Victor Talofari and Leonard Justice, following their arraignment for allegedly abducting and raping a 16-year-old girl. They will be in prison, pending advice by Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Magistrate B.O. Osunsanmi refused to take the defendants’ plea “because this court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the matter.” She ordered that they be remanded in Kirikiri and adjourned till April 8. Prosecuting Inspector Rachael Donny said the defendants committed the offence on January 30 at the Army Cantonment, Ikeja. She alleged that the defendants abducted the girl from her guardian, lodged her in their house and had sex with her. Donny said the girl was abducted when she was sent  to Mammy Market to buy pepper. She alleged that the defendants locked the girl in a room and raped her for four days. The prosecutor said the defendants released her after four days. She said the girl’s guardian reported the case to the police and the defendants were arrested.
