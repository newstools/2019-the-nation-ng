 Inter Milan have ‘named their price of £68million’ for wantaway striker Mauro Icardi with Real Madrid retaining an interest. The Argentine forward has not featured for Inter in more than a month due to an ongoing row over contract negotiations. And according to Spanish outlet AS, Madrid chiefs reportedly spoke to their counterparts at Inter last week where the price the La Liga side needed to pay this summer became clear. Icardi played no part in Sunday’s 3-2 win over city rivals AC Milan at the San Siro and continues to be an isolated member of Luciano Spalletti’s squad. Madrid, back under the management of Zinedine Zidane, are still looking to bolster their attack having felt the effects of losing Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus last summer. Eden Hazard is of interest to Real but with the long-term future of striker Karim Benzema unclear, Icardi, given his current exile at Inter, remains a firm target Zidane bowed out first time round having won three consecutive Champions League titles but knows he needs to make wholesale changes to an ageing squad and a goalscorer is high on his priority list with Icardi fitting the description. Icardi was stripped of the Inter captaincy back in February and has not played since as his future continues to remain a source of constant debate in Italy. Having held the captaincy for three years before the latest exile, there is a growing sense the club and player will separate come the summer window. His lack of playing time has also seen him overlooked by the national team for the latest batch of matches. The AS report continues that while Icardi is a key striker target, so is Tottenham forward Harry Kane, although that is a deal that would cost considerably more than £68m.
