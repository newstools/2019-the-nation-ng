Sponsors have continued to throw their support behind The Match which will take place between May 17 and 19 at the rebuilt Onikan Stadium in honour of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Japans sportswear manufacturers, Mizuno, Wakabet and Kobayashi Bitters are the three latest sponsors to give their backing to the game. Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia who brokered a deal with Mizuno stated that the partnership would add colour to the game, which will see former Nigerian stars take on their African counterpart. He said that the sportswear manufacturing outfit was excited about being part of the game. “It is good that we have Mizuno on board. I am sure their involvement would help give The Match the needed exposure, while all the players would adorn Mizuno’s jersey on match day. As their brand ambassador, I will also ensure that all the players involved in the game get the best from the sponsor.” He stated that the match would bring back the good old days when the former players showcased African football to the world. He also stated that the match will be used to honour Governor Ambode, who did so much for sports in the last four years. Principal partner, Waidi Akanni also disclosed that Wakabet and Kobayashi Bitters has decided to support the programme, describing the gesture a laudable one that would help organize a befitting game for Governor Ambode. He stated that the coming on board of various sponsors showed that they (the organisers) were doing something worthwhile. “We are happy to have Wakabet  and Kobayashi Bitters on board. It shows that we are doing the right thing and hopefully we will have a good game in May. We (the former Nigerian stars) are excited to have our Africa counterpart play against us on our soil.”
