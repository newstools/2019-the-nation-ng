President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured the All Progressives Congress(APC) family in Akwa Ibom that the party’s votes which were stolen during the February 23 presidential/national Assembly elections would be reclaimed. Buhari gave the assurance yesterday in Uyo during a Town hall meeting to appreciate Akwa Ibom electorate for casting their ballot for the (APC) on February 23. Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who represented the President, encouraged the electorate to defend their votes during the Governorship and House of Assembly elections. He stated that it was not possible for Senator Godswill Akpabio to have lost the election, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) robbed him and the party of victory, and that all the wrongs that were done during the Presidential and National Assembly elections would be addressed. He said: “What happened on the 23rd of February was robbery. The votes of the people was stolen but we are not deterred. The President sent me to thank you today. We are going to make sure that everything that was stolen on the 23rd February would be restored. “It is not possible that Senator Godwill Akpabio lost. We are in no doubt that Senator Akpabio is the elected senator of Akwa Ibom North West senatorial district. I, and Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of party have been in the opposition for long and we cannot be defeated anymore. “Everyone of you should go out to vote on Saturday and defend your votes; we cannot be cheated; not only you, but tell your neighbours to vote for Obong Nsima Ekere and all APC candidates. Wait for your votes to be counted. It is the duty of the Federal Government to provide security and we will do that. We will recover every one of our votes.” Also speaking, Oshiomhole said the party was not in the state to lament but to thank the people of the state for doing their jobs and voting President Buhari.
