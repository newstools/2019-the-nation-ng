The leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Warri North council area of Delta state has accused men of the 19 Battalion of the Nigerian Army of taking part in the irregularities that marred last Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections in the area. Condemning the actions of the army during the polls, a chieftain of the party in Koko, Chief Attie Okorodudu, alleged that personnel of the Nigerian Army on election duties, presided over electoral fraud that was perpetrated in some parts of Warri North and Sapele council areas. He said: “we have it on good authority that the army is guilty of carrying out electoral fraud in parts of Delta State precisely Warri North and Sapele local government areas. “They claimed to have escorted electoral materials but unfortunately, the materials being escorted by the army did not get to their destinations, yet results emerged from such areas.” Meanwhile, when reached earlier for a response on a similar allegation, the spokesman of the 6 Division, Nigerian Army, Port Harcourt, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, said the allegations by the parties against security agencies we’re borne out of wrong perception of what the agencies stand for. “People see security agencies as instruments of the state that can be used by the ruling party. The opposition parties will bash on the security agency, the ruling party will also bash on the security. The election is over, if he is not satisfied, he should go the Election Petition Tribunal,” Iliyasu said.
