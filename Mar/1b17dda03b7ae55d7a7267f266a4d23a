The Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) has opened the Ilaje-Bariga Jetty, as part of its commitment to improve waterways transportation. Its General Manager, Mr. Damilola Emmanuel, said the world-class jetty was another landmark on the list of jetties delivered by the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration to reposition water transportation. The jetty, he said, has a park and ride facility, eatery park, toilet facilities, comfortable seating arrangements, a ticketing mall, an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) gallery and other conveniences. He said passengers could get ferries going to Apapa, CMS, Ebute Ero, Victoria Island and Falomo from the jetty. Passengers, he said, could move from Bariga to any part of the Island or Apapa in 20 minutes, adding that with such speed, water transportation offered a new travel experience for those seeking a better way to beat gridlock. Emmanuel said: â€œWe will continue our zero tolerance for accidents on our waterways by enforcing the life jackets regulations.
