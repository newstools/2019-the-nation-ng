NATIONAL President of Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) Iyalode Alaba Lawson has said the body will partner the Federal Government in key areas of the economy. Lawson said the association would be part of ongoing transformative revolution in the agriculture sector. The NACCIMA said: “This revolution unfolding before our eyes must be explored, hence the association is concluding partnership arrangements with the International Institute for tropical Agriculture (IITA).” She spoke in Ado Ekiti yesterday at the association’s First Council Meeting for 2019, saying the association would continue to partner governments to promote private sector activity. Lawson said the private sector could tap into opportunities in the mining sector and how those in mining states could take advantage of innovation  in the mining roadmap. Lawson said: “We have also started to explore new areas, such as entertainment and creativity, travel and hospitality industry, which contributed N239 billion to GDP in 2016… “NACCIMA is poised to tap into opportunities opening up, such as the Global Inter-Agency Initiative on Youth Employment in which OPS members… will play a crucial role. We hope …through our participation, more opportunities will be opened for our NACCIMA youth entrepreneurs … “…the association’s Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTSP) 2018-2022 continues to be a useful roadmap … ” Lawson, who praised Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi for his achievements in the first term, said “the governor’s four cardinal agenda in the second tenure would move the state forward and break new frontiers.”
