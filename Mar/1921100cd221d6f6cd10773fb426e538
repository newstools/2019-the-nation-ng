The Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the rejection of results of the governorship and state House of Assembly elections in the state by the Allied People’s Movement (APM). APC advised APM, its governorship candidate and principal to approach the court of law if they have issues with the results, warning that if they failed to heed the advice, it might be tempted to drag the complaining parties for manifest malpractices and vote buying allegedly perpetrated by them. In a statement by the Publicity Secretary of APC Caretaker Committee in the state, Com. Tunde Oladunjoye, he described APM, the gubernatorial candidate and his principal as “sore losers.” Oladunjoye wondered how a party that was hurriedly birthed in January 2019 expects to win an expect it to win the governorship election two months later, dismissing them as “vainglorious dreamers.” He stated: “I think it was Shakespeare that wrote that ‘Cowards die many times before their deaths, The valiant never taste of death but once.’ “Akinlade and his principal are sore losers. What they attempted negates historical antecedents in politics. “They are vainglorious dreamers. Or how can you form a party in January 2019 and expect to win the governorship election in a state like Ogun by March 2019? “We urged them to go to court, because even if they don’t, we shall, on our own, go to court for manifest malpractices which they perpetrated during the election. In Ewekoro, it was outright vote buying. “In Obafemi Owode, One of their candidates was arrested for voters inducement, in Ado Odo Ota, a top serving officer of the state government was arrested with already thumb-printed ballot papers.”
