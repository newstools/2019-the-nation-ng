The Association of Resident Doctors-University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (ARD-UCTH) has embarked on an indefinite strike due to the alleged failure of the Management of the hospital to meet their demands. A notice of commencement of the strike, signed by its chairman, Dr Imoke Echeng and Secretary, Dr Ucheji Okechukwu, expressed their resolve and commitment to call off the industrial action and maintain industrial peace and harmony with the management of UCTH in the belief that the management on its own part will live up to its responsibilities and make good on its promises to the ARD-UCTH. The notice, obtained by The Nation in Calabar on Tuesday, read in part, “The Congress of the ARD-UCTH observed with utmost displeasure the following: “Failure of management of UCTH to respond to our demands after notice of a 3-day ultimatum issued on the 14thof February 2019 to midnight of 18thFebruary 2019. “Failure of management to respond to our demands after embarking on a three day warning strike which commenced on the morning of 19thFebruary 2019 and ended by 8am on Friday 22ndof February 2019 after which our members resumed duty. “Failure of management of UCTH to respond to our demand after the Congress agreed to an appeal by UCTH management to give them till the end of the month of February to do the needful. “Failure of UCTH to respond to our demands after a further appeal by them to further extend the date of the response to our demands from the initial month end of February to 15thMarch 2019.” The Congress therefore resolved as follows: “That members of ARD-UCTH embarks on a total indefinite strike action arising from this meeting 18thof March 2019. “That the total and indefinite strike will continue until such a time that the alerts of the salary arrears 2014-2016 are received by members of our Association (a minimum of one tranche)” Speaking with The Nation yesterday evening, Echeng said they were talking with Management on how to resolve the impact of the action and expressed hope it would be resolved as soon as possible.
