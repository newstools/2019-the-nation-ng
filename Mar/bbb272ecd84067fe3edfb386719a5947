Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded in prison a 26-year-old hotel worker, Jeffery Ehizojie, following his arraignment for alleged murder. He was alleged to have  killed the owner and the  manager  of the hotel on January 25 at 3a.m., at 42, Budland Street, Ojodu Berger, Lagos. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere said he would be in custody,  pending advice by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye alleged that the defendant and others at large conspired to steal from the deceased, but ended up strangling them. Olaluwoye said the defendant was an employee of Etashol Hotel and Suites belonging to Mrs. Sola Olusoga, 42. She alleged that the defendant also strangled the hotel manager, Mr. Tunji Omikunle, 39, who was present at the time of the attempted theft. “My Lord, the defendant and his accomplices attempted to drug Olusoga and Omikunle, but when it didn’t go as planned, they strangled them,” the prosecutor said. She said after the murder, the defendant absconded to Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, where he was arrested. The case continues on April 10.
