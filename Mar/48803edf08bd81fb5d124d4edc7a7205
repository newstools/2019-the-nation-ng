 Cristiano Ronaldo has been charged by UEFA for his celebration in Juventus’ last-16 Champions League game against Atletico Madrid. The 34-year-old fired his side into the quarter-finals with a hat-trick in the second leg in Turin, overturning Atletico’s 2-0 victory from the first leg. Ronaldo followed one of his goals by copying Diego Simeone’s ‘crotch-grabbing’ celebration from the first leg, for which the latter was given a £17,000 fine. The celebration is considered improper conduct and there are strong indications that the former Real Madrid ace who was dubbed a magician after he fired his side to Champions League quarterfinals will be punished for the celebration. Simeone said his gesture showed he had the courage to make tough selection decisions. He apologised two days later The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will deal with this case at its next meeting on March 21. Juventus will play Ajax in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final in Amsterdam on April 10. Meanwhile Juventus are reportedly preparing to battle Barcelona for the signature of Ajax captain Matthijs de Ligt. Widely regarded as one of the best young centre-backs in European football, De Ligt has already made more than 100 appearances for Ajax despite only turning 19 in August. Barca continue to be strongly linked with a move for the Netherlands international, but according to Tuttosport, De Ligt is Juve’s ‘first choice to revitalise their defence’. The teenager, who has a contract in Amsterdam until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, has scored twice in 25 Eredivisie appearances this term.
