The Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor Akinwummi Ambode, Mr. Samuel Ojo, said he was confident of All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) governorship candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu when he voted on Saturday. Ojo, who spoke yesterday in Ikeja, said he was confident of victory because the Ambode administration had given democracy dividends to Lagosians. The chief of staff, who said he voted at Magodo, noted that the incoming governor would take the state to the next level. He said the poll was peaceful despite that there was little delay in some polling booths. Ojo said APC had a clear chance to win the election because it had won the hearts of Lagosians through its good programmes.
