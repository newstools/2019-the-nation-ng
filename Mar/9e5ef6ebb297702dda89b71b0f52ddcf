In his new single, ‘Dangote’, Burna Boy has focused his art to social narratives in the country. Using Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man as a peg, the Afrofusion artiste addresses a number of the economic problems the youth in Nigeria face on a day-to-day basis and how they deal with it. In the video, some of the everyday happenings like commuting on public buses, hanging around street corners, and using laptops are portrayed. As Burna Boy sings about the hustle in true Fela style, one story segues to another, giving the link to Nigerian life. Also, aside the saxophone solos, scenes from Da New Afrika Shrine also feature towards the end of song, a tribute to Fela. Two things set apart this video, directed by Clarence Peters, from the others. Firstly, we see these stories told from the perspectives of the people living these lives, and we also see the consequences of their actions.
