Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has vowed the people will resist attempts from any person or group targeted to manipulate Saturdayâ€™s supplementary elections. He spoke at Government House Makurdi when he received Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Representatives Members-elect from the state, who showed their Certificates of Return to him. The governor charged security agents and staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be professional during the supplementary election. He said conducive atmosphere must be provided for free and credible exercise. He stated he took the decision of the electoral body to declare the March 9th Governorship election inconclusive in good faith with the conviction that nothing was going to affect the victory of the PDP at the polls, which people of the state gave the party. While congratulating the members-elect on their victories, Ortom stated that having produced three senators, six House of Representatives members and 17 Assembly members and still expecting more at the rerun coupled with wide margin between the PDP and APC at the governorship election, his victory was guaranteed. Rt. Hon Mark Gbillah, reelected House of Representatives member representing Gwer-East and Gwer-West, on behalf of his colleagues, stated they paid the visit to thank the governor for his support for them at the polls. He said they returned home to mobilise support for his reelection and formally present their Certificates of Return to him as a mark of gratitude and appreciation. Other House of Representatives Members-elect present during the visit were Messrs. Bob Tyough for Kwande/Ushongo; Richard Gbande Logo/Ukum/Katsina-Ala; Kpamor Jimin Sokpo for Buruku; Benjamin Mzondu, Makurdi/Guma and Dr. Francis Ottah Agbo for Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo federal constituencies.
