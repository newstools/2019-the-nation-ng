Panic and apprehension have taken the better part of the residents of the serene and agrarian community of Iwoye-Yewa in Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State, following threats by a farmer to kill eight more people after he had shot dead two members of the community last Wednesday. The grieving community claimed that the farmer identified as Oladosu Nureni and who is acting as if let loose on the villagers, allegedly shot the victims – Ajayi Onifade, who until his killing, was the Amuludun of Iwoye land and Olatunji Ayinla, at different locations by the suspect. The Nation learnt that Nureni, whose house is located few buildings away from that of late Onifade, shot the victim at close range on his way to farm while Ayinla who was part of a search team for the suspect, was however shot dead by same suspect – Nureni during a manhunt for him. It was learnt that Onifade did not die at the scene of attack; he was rescued and taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta for treatment but died last Friday. The eldest child of Ajayi Onifade, Seyi, told reporters that the case has been reported at the Ilaro Divisional Police Headquarters, Ilaro, and wondered why the suspect has not yet been arrested by the police. Seyi urged the Police to act fast and apprehend the suspect, alleging that his conduct portends further danger to the community as he kept threatening to deal ruthlessly with anybody who dared to be part of search party for him. But the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Ogun State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he was not aware of the incident when contacted. Oyeyemi, told reporters on phone that he was on his way to Abeokuta from Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, promising to inquire about it from Ilaro Divisional Police headquarters and revert accordingly but he is yet to come with any feedback as at the time of filing the report.
