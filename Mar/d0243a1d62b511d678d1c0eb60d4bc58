The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has condemned the alleged detention of his son-in-law and lawyer by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Atiku, via a Tweet on his Twitter handle on Monday, said: “My son in law and lawyer have been detained, one for 3 weeks and the other recently. They are paying the price for supporting me. I urge those now persecuting them to remember that a government’s mandate is to pursue peace and justice for all, and not just those who support them.’ Atiku’s tweet is coming two days after he raised an alarm of alleged moves to make him congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari, following the outcome of February 23 election. In a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, on Saturday, the PDP candidate said his son-in-law, who is also the finance director of his group of companies, was arrested in Abuja. According to the statement, officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) allegedly invaded the Maitama residence of Babalele (Atiku’s son-in-law)  in Abuja. Atiku insisted that he would under no circumstance “mortgage the mandate of Nigerians as freely expressed on the 23rd of February 2019.” However, the EFCC and other relevant agencies are yet to react to the allegations by the former vice president. My son in law and lawyer have been detained, one for 3 weeks and the other recently. They are paying the price for supporting me. I urge those now persecuting them to remember that a government’s mandate is to pursue peace and justice for all, and not just those who support them. — Atiku Abubakar (@atiku) March 4, 2019
