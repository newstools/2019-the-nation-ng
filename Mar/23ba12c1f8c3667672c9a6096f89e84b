In a show of gratitude, hip hop megastar Davido has gifted his friend and personal assistant, Lati, a red Mercedes Benz car. Taking to Instagram late Saturday, Davido shared a video of the vehicle reportedly worth N70m being offloaded from a container. “U’ve been looking after me since I was 13,” wrote Davido. “Your probably the only one that I know would do the same if we switched positions !! Love you my brother! My back bone!! Enjoy this small gift! @ t_ddon …… Nah me pick Lati call las las.” Responding by also posting the same video on Instagram, Lati went down memory lane about the love he has received from Davido and the Adeleke family. “I have known you since you were 10 years old, that was when I lost both my parents,” he wrote. “You are always there for me like a brother and you have never turned your back against me, I know God would continue to bless you and your family. I pray for everyone that your “destiny helper would look for you even though they are far from you, God would bring them close to you” DAVID ADELEKE aka DAVIDO is an ANGEL and a KING not just an artist. I pray people like this live long in good health and prosperity. And I Thank GOD for your INCOMING blessing that the world would soon know about. Luh you bro @davidoofficial” Last week, Davido had said he was going to buy cars for his close associates and started by gifting a Mercedes Benz to Aloma who is also with his 30 Billion Gang.
