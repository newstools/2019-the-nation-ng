The Police on Wednesday arraigned one Daniel Bassey, in a Wuse Zone II Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, for allegedly forging Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) vehicle auction papers. Bassey was docked on charges bordering on joint act, criminal breach of trust, cheating and forgery. The prosecutor, Chijioke Okezie, told the court that the Assistant Inspector-General of Police Zone 7, Abuja, received a petition from one Mr Segun Adeyemi, on Nov. 6, 2018. Okezie alleged that the defendant allegedly convinced the complainant to bid for custom auction car sales; he also impersonated NCS officers and forged papers of an Hiace bus, which the complainant indicated interest on. He said the complainant allegedly transferred N2. 4 million to the defendant, while he converted the money to personal use. The prosecutor said the defendant’s accomplices are now at large, adding that the offences contravened the provisions of Sections 79, 312, 322 and 364 of the Penal Code. The defendant, however, denied committing the offences. Magistrate Mabel Segun-Bello, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N1.5 million with two sureties in like sum. The case was adjourned until March 27, for further hearing. NAN
