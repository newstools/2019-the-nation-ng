 Super Eagles captain John Obi Mikel is certainly enjoying the bliss with his partner and mother of his kids Olga Allegra. And if you think the Nigerian international only knows how to dazzle on the pitch, you are wrong as he can indeed be romantic when the moment calls for it. The former Chelsea star can hardly believe that seven years has rolled bye since he met his Russian jewel who has been like a pillar of support. Taking to Instagram  Mikel who has since started enjoying regular play following his move to Championship side Middlesbrough from Chinese Super league side Tiajin Teda, wrote: ‘Happy anniversary grumps � @olga_allegra! To many more years of always looking and heading in the same direction. Love you'” An appreciative Olga Allegra also captured her own response in few letters “7 years of you ♥️'” The couple never misses any opportunity to enjoy family togetherness with their two lovely daughters. Olga Allegra never fails to count the blessings they have enjoyed since their love boat sailed off, recalled that it all started when Mikel was living in the same neighborhood where she lived with her parents but nothing like they say happened until the right time and opportunity presented itself. “Mikel used to be my parents neighbor. We lived there for 5 years. “As my parents were leaving the flat, I dropped off the keys at his flat and that was how we met and started off as friends and then grew into lovers. “It was never a magical love story because we were neighbors for 5 years but we never met until I went to drop off the keys when my parents were about to leave the apartment,” she revealed Mikel who has missed a number of Super Eagles matches especially after the World cup in Russia will be hoping to be in super shape to be part of the Nations cup in Egypt later this year. The Eagles rounded off their qualifiers last week couple of weeks back with a 3-1 defeat of Seychelles. The team had qualified with a game to spare but needed to win the last match to formally confirm position as group leaders finishing at 13 points with South Africa in the second position with 12 points in Group E of the qualifiers.
