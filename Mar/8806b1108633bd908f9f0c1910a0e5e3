A group, Coalition of Christian Youths for All Progressives Congress, has condemned the demand of opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare its candidate winner of the Adamawa State governorship election. The PDP candidate, Umaru Fintiri, attained the lead votes in that election, but INEC declared the election inconclusive because the margin of lead was lower than the number of registered voters in polling units where voting was cancelled, following which the PDP demanded that its candidate be declared winner because its candidate’s margin of lead was higher than number of people who collected their PVCs in the affected polling units. Reacting to PDP’s position, however, the northern leader of the Coalition of Christian Youths for All Progressives Congress, Càleb Adamu, accused PDP of being desperate and running faster than its legs by asking to be declared winner of an election it has not won. “How desperate can PDP be to want to take the laws into their hands on an election that was declared inconclusive in 44 polling units across some LGAs in the State?” he said, adding that PDP could not rightly claim that it knows electoral laws than INEC. “They should please allow INEC to do their job,” he said. Caleb sided with the APC which had earlier faulted the conduct of the election in more places than the 44 units where INEC had cancelled voting, asking that the election be cancelled altogether. He called on INEC to do a rerun election in all the 21 LGAs in the state, lamenting that the entire process had been crooked, “with dozens of complaints and petitions submitted by political parties which participated in the election. Twenty nine political parties participated in the election, and by the time it was declared inconclusive on Monday morning, the PDP had attained 367,471 votes; APC 334,995; ADC 113,205; and SDP 29,785; but INEC said the margin of lead between the two leading parties: PDP and APC, which was 32,467; was lower than the number of registered voters, 40,948, in polling units where voting was cancelled.
