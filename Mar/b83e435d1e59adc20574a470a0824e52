As part of efforts to combat the spread of tuberculosis (TB), in society, a group, Agbami Co-Ventures, in partnership with Women’s Rights Advancement and Protection Alternative (WRAPA) and the Delta state government, has intensified its sensitisation programme across three council areas in the state. The campaign, which aims to educate as well as care for persons suffering from the ailment, started in October last year and was scheduled in Warri South, Warri North and Ethiope East local government areas of Delta State. Speaking during the exercise in Warri, Thursday, the WRAPA coordinator, Mrs. Edna Ohunayo, explained that “the project which started in October 2018 is to educate and sensitise the general public on prevention, care and control of Tuberculosis”. She stated that the campaign also included training of care providers, peer educators community vanguards and advocacy visits to major stakeholders and also, community outreach programmes and rallies in the selected council areas. The state Tuberculosis and Leprosy Coordinator, Dr. Alex Akpodiete had in December 2018, raised an alarm that about 12,000 cases of the disease are likely to occur yearly in Delta state alone. Akpodiete stated this during a Tuberculosis Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilisation Flag-Off Programme, adding that there is a possibility that two out of every family of six in Nigeria, would have the infection.
