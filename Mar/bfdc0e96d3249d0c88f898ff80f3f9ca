Anxiety mounts at the 2019 General Elections State Collation Centre within the State Headquarters of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Magbon, Abeokuta, as results for the Saturday governorship election in Ogun State have started arriving in bits from the 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) preparatory to their being announced. Many within and outside the INEC Office are anxious to get the results first from the Commission, to authenticate or disprove what they were picking from unauthorised quarters. Already, results from seven Local Governments have arrived the collation centre and in no time, they would be announced one after the other by the respective LGA Returning Officers. At least 40 political parties fielded candidates for the 2019 gubernatorial poll in the state but the major contenders have remained the quartet of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Allied People’s Movement (APM) and African Democratic Congress (ADC). Feelers from the field across the state’s 20 LGAs indicated that Prince Adedapo Abiodun of the APC, is leading the pack of contestants and is most predicted to coast home to victory. Abiodun, a successful entrepreneur, real estate player and Oil magnate appeared to have dominated the Ogun East, his Senatorial district in his performance while also making an audacious presence in both Ogun Central with the help of party leaders and chieftains like former Governor Olusegun Osoba and Ogun West, the constituency of his running mate, Engr. Noimot Salako – Oyedele. Other major contenders are Senator Buruji Kashamu (PDP), Governor Ibikunle Amosun’s preferred candidate; Hon. Abdulkabir Adekunle Akinlade(APM) and Prince Gboyega Nasir Isiaka (ADC), a third time contestant and each time, on a different political platform.
