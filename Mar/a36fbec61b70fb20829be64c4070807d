The candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC) for Akwa Ibom North West senatorial district, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has approached the election tribunal sitting in Uyo to commence legal processes to challenge his loss at February 23 senatorial election. The suit at the tribunal was filed on the 16th of March by his lawyer, Mr. Sunday Ameh SAN, followed Senator Akpabio’s withdrawal of the case he earlier filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja. The case at the Federal High Court had sought to challenge his Senate re-election loss. Akpabio is seeking to upturn the victory of Christopher Ekpenyong and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) based on perceived electoral irregularities which characterised the said election. The former Senate Minority Leader, had while the election was ongoing, besieged the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), alleging cases of infractions and deliberate violations of the electoral law and guidelines during the senatorial election. In the said election, INEC had allegedly in collaboration with some PDP chieftains in the senatorial district, wrongfully declared Ekpeyong and his party, the PDP, winner of the poll, having scored 118,215 as against Akpabio’s 83,158. However, Ameh SAN said the result sheets from Akwa Ibom INEC office showed different figures that had Akpabio securing 138,256 votes as against Ekpeyong’s 123,843. Akpabio’s counsel said his client is dissatisfied with the conduct and outcome of the election. ”The former governor of Akwa Ibom and his party has approached the election petition tribunal to ventilate their grievances as well as reclaim their stolen mandate.”
