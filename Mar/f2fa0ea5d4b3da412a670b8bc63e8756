 Former international Joseph Yobo has urged Super Eagles coach to use the forthcoming AFCON qualifier against Seychelles on Friday in Asaba, to test fresh legs in the national team. Yobo who expressed delight that the Eagles qualified for Egypt 2019 with a game to spare, opined that there is nothing at stake in the last match against Seychelles adding that it is the best opportunity younger players can have to show what they can do. The former Everton defender made the submission while contributing to Monday Night football. Asked to put himself in the shoes of the coach ahead of Tuesday’s encounter, the former Fenerbahçe strong man said “If I were to be in his position or advise him I would say “Use the match to test fresh legs.  We have qualified with a game to spare and I must congratulate the team for achieving that feat. So give younger players an opportunity to express themselves because after now there will be no more time,” he said Yobo who made career 387 appearances for six clubs in the course of his soccer career also made 101 appearances for the national team between 2001 and 2014. Yobo who flagged his soccer career with Belgian side Standard Liège played for Marseille, Tenerife, Everton, Fenerbahçe and Norwich City respectively. Already qualified Nigeria, lead group E of the AFCON 2019 qualifiers with 10 points in 5 matches. The pressure in the group this weekend will be on Bafana Bafana of South Africa who are second in the group with nine points and face Libya who are on seven points in the last group match. Should the South Africans fail to take their chances on Sunday, at the Stade Taïeb Mhiri in Tunis, The Mediterranean Knights may turn the table and clinch the second group ticket.
