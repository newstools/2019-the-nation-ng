A United States-based businessman, Busayo Afolami, who allegedly defrauded two men of N22.6 million, was Monday brought before an Igbosere Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos. Afolami, 39, was accused by the police of obtaining N22.6 million from two men under the pretext of importing vehicles for them. The defendant was arraigned before Mrs. Folashade Botoku on a six-count charge of conspiracy, threat to life and fraud. Prosecuting Sergeant Chinedu Njoku said the defendant committed the alleged offences sometime in June 2013, at No. 1, Oba Aladejobi Street, Ikeja, Lagos and sometime in October 2013, at No.53, Olugbede Street, Akowonjo, Lagos. He alleged that in June 2013, the defendant fraudulently obtained $35,300 (equivalent of N12.7 million) from one Mr. Onipede Olatunbosun. According to Njoku, the defendant obtained the said money from Olatunbosun, under guise of using the money to buy a Lexus 350, a Honda 2010 model and a Corolla 2005 from America for the complainant. He said the defendant did not import any of the cars for the complainant but converted the said money to his own personal use. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant threatened the life of Olatunbosun by calling him on phone to forget the said money. The court also heard that sometime in October 2013, the defendant fraudulently obtained $31,900 (equivalent of N9.9 million) from another complainant, one Joel Fagoriola, under the guise of buying him ten 25-tons trucks of Mack and Man Diesel models. Njoku said the defendant did not purchase the said trucks but converted the said money to his use. The offences, the prosecutor added, contravened Sections 232, 287, 314 (1) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Afolami pleaded not guilty. In a bench ruling, Chief Magistrate Botoku granted him N5million bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. She adjourned further proceedings till April 2.
