The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Zamfara State Office has distributed sensitive election materials for the March 9 Governorship and State Assembly elections. Addressing newsmen while distributing the materials, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Asmau Maikudi, said the distribution was done early to ensure a hitch-free exercise. “You are all aware of the logistics problem encountered (in the state) during the presidential and national assembly elections. “This occurred as a result of a court order to include the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the national assembly elections,’’ he said. Asmau assured that since the issue had been resolved, all the materials would reach polling units before 8:00 a.m. on Saturday and election would commence at the designated time. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that all the sensitive election materials were handed over to the Local Government Electoral Officers of all the 14 councils. A total of 1,671,333 ballot papers were distributed for State Assembly elections and 1,701,061 for the governorship election across the 14 council areas. The process was carried out in the presence of agents of all the political parties participating in the elections. Other materials distributed include results sheets for polling units, ward and local government collation, state assembly as well as governorship return sheets. NAN
