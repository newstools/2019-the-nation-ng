The Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, Mr. Olukunle Ojo, has urged civil servants to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and others in tomorrow’s elections. According to him, this is necessary for the public to continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy. Ojo said the workers should canvass the support of their friends and neighbours for the APC candidates in the governorship and house of assembly polls. He said if the APC candiwon, the progress and development enjoyed by Lagosians will not be truncated. Ojo spoke yesterday when he met with the workers at the Office of the Chief of Staff, Alausa, Ikeja to solicit support for Sanwo-Olu, his running mate, Obafemi Hamzat and APC house of assembly candidates. Said he: “Lagos, as we all know, has enjoyed good governance since 1999. Right from the time of our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to former governor Babatunde Fashola and our vibrant Governor Akinwummi Ambode, Lagosians have been enjoying good governance. It is now time to vote for continuity, and more importantly to take Lagos to the next level. “You can see how our governor is campaigning vigorously for Sanwo-Olu and other APC candidates. So let all of us contribute our quota, perform our civic responsibilities by campaigning for the APC candidates. Please go out and vote massively for the APC candidates tomorrow.”
