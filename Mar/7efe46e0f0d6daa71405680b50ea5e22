The Ezendigbo Alimosho General and Chairman, Council of Elders of Non-Indigene Forum in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State, Dr. Lawrence Eze, has urged the people to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) tomorrow. At a general meeting yesterday, Eze noted that since the APC took over the government in 1999, the party has achieved conspicuous achievements and therefore deserves continuity. He told the meeting that tomorrow’s election is wholly for APC candidates, and so urged them to vote for the interest of the non-indigenes since it has been agreed that non-indigenes would be included in the party’s leadership. According to him, the party’s governorship candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is more of an administrator than a politician, having been in the system for long, and so knows the need and yarning of Lagosians. He said: “Sanwo-Olu has promised to build link bridges in Alimosho, therefore he needs our vote to deliver these promises.” The Seriki Hausa, Alhaji Haruna, agreed with Ezein, and told his people to be realistic and focused in their dealings. “Tomorrow’s election, as noted by the Ezendigbo, is about interests. And since the leadership of APC has concluded to involve the non-indigenes in their government more than before, we should therefore vote APC and work assiduously for a landslide victory of APC. The Onu of Igala, Chief Anthony Ayegba, described Sanwo-Olu as the best man for the job considering his long service in the government of Lagos State, and verse experiences. “Four years of continuation of APC is better than four years of trial and error,” he added.
