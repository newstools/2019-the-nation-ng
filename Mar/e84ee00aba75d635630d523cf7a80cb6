Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said that the Ondo State University of Science and Technology (OSUSTECH) would be renamed after former Governor of the state, Late Olusegun Agagu. Akeredolu disclosed this during a thank-you tour to Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo Southern Senatorial District. He explained that the two newly-elected House of Assembly members representing Okitipupa 1 and 11 constituencies, Akineogunde Akinfomide and Akinwumi Emmanuel would move the motion for the renaming of the University to Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa. According to the governor, it is a decision that can only be taken by the House of Assembly and they would move the motion as their first assignment. He said“You know we have Adekunle Ajasin University in Akungba and it won’t be bad to have Olusegun Agagu University in Okitipupa. “When we came on board, we noticed that the University lacked infrastructural facilities, a good road network and other areas which we looked into and fixed. “The project would have been added to the museum of abandoned projects, hence the need for the major upgrades by this administration”. Akeredolu who thanked the people for conducting themselves in a peaceful manner during the election, lauded them and sought for their continued support for the party.
