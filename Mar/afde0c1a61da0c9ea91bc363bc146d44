The Accord Party has dismissed reports of a High Court judgment barring the party from participating in the Rivers State governorship and House of Assembly elections. A statement by the National Chairman, Muhammad Nalado, lamented that political opponents were peddling propaganda that Accord party will not participate in the election. He described the report as falsehood, and assured supporters that the party is still in the contest, having mobilised voters for the election. According to him, the rumour is the machination of those who are afraid of losing power. He emphasised that the party’s candidate stands tall above every other contestant. According to Nalado, though the High Court in Rivers State has passed a judgment that the party’s candidate, Dumo Lulu-Briggs, is not the rightful candidate, the party has appealed the judgment already. He emphasised that Accord is still very much in the race for the governorship, and asked the people to vote for the party and its candidates in the elections.
