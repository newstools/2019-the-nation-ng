 The Fraternity in the Super Falcons team came to the fore Wednesday as the players tickled one of their own Rita Chikwelu as she added one more year to her age. Chikwelu known for her doggedness on the pitch had the traditional “baptism” of water that has become the popular way of identifying with a celebrant especially among the youths. It involves the sprinkling of water on the celebrant from head to toe.  Sometimes the water is just cold with room temperature but sometimes taken directly from the fridge most times forcing the celebrant to run while friends and well-wishers follow in pursuit with bottles and sachets of water as the case may be. A video dished out on Social media show the former Umeå IK of Sweden midfielder being chased about by teammates at a beach in Cyprus where the team is currently participating in the Cyprus Cup. Tired of running away from teammates the celebrant had no choice but to stop to be properly soaked to mark the occasion. The former Olympic team ace that has made over 33 appearances for the Super Falcons since breaking into the senior team in 2007 was impressive as Falcons claimed their 9th African Women Championship in Ghana last year picking qualification for the World cup in France in the bargain. As part of the shape up for the June 2019 event, Falcons participated in a recent four Nations cup in China followed by ongoing Cyprus cup. Close watchers of the team however say their performance in both tournaments fall below par, an indication that they need to up their game if they are go post impressive run in France.
