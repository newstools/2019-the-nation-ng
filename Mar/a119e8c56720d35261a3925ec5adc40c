He said troops on routine patrol of the waterways sighted a capsized boat and immediately intervened to rescue the 12 passengers. “The boat mishap happened at about 1330 hours on Thursday, March 28 around Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) Map Jetty in Ngo, Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers. “It is gratifying to state that all 11 passengers and the baby were rescued with no casualty recorded,” he said.
