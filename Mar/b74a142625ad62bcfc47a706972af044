A Consultant Nephrologist, University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) Dr. Enajite Okaka, has urged Nigerians to avoid excessive intake of pain killer drugs to prevent kidney damage. Dr. Okaka who spoke to newsmen to mark the World Kidney Day in Benin City said some herbs could also be responsible for kidney related problems. Okaka said pain killers drugs could cause kidney disease when taken in large amount and for a long period of time. According to him, “And you see people whose jobs are largely physical, they tend to end up with body aches and pains at the end of the day, they go to the chemist to buy medicines for body pains. “More often than not, they give them a cocktail of pain killers and they take them, they feel so good and relief. “So they go back again and again and that can damage their kidney. “Some times people come to the hospital and by the time they come with kidney and we discovered that it is from the herb they have taken”, she said. Okaka appealed to the federal and state governments to subsidize the cost of treating hypertension and diabetics to enable patients get affordable treament. “The government should take care of those things that lead to kidney disease. Common things like hypertension and diabetics. If they can make the treatment of hypertension, diabetics free, people who have them, can get the drugs. “There are some persons who are not taken medicines for hypertension even though their blood pressure is high and when you ask them, they will tell you that they do not have money to buy. “So if the medicines can be subsidized so that they are cheap, free, more people will treat”, she said.
