The National Peace Committee led by former Head of State Abdulsalami Abubakar on Wednesday appealed to stakeholders to calm their supporters in the wake of the halted collation of result for the March 9 governorship election. The committee also told them to urge their supporters to conduct themselves peacefully as they await the outcome of a recent order from the Federal High Court in Abuja halting the collation of result. The court restrained the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from resuming collation of result for Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area, the only LGA left to be announced. The former Head of State, who was represented by a member and Deputy Director of The Kukah Centre, Duke Anoemuah, gave the advice during a Town Hall meeting with stakeholders on the peaceful 2019 elections for governorship and State House of Assembly. During the meeting with the theme “Ensuring peaceful Co -existence during the elections in Bauchi State” Abubakar called on all political actors to preach a message of peace to their followers to comport themselves and prevent resentment that could result to violence. “This meeting is geared to reinforce peace, the message of peace and to implore actors and their supporters to accept the outcome of the results of various levels of the electioneering process. It would help to strengthen mutual confidence among politicians and to encourage peaceful resolution of all election- related disputes with utmost regard to the rule of law and the due process, “he said. The atmosphere in the state is quite intense as agitated supporters have taken to the streets to protest. The protesters, which comprise mostly women, had registered their displeasure with the recent court order from Abuja. They remained defiant, pouring into the streets and venting their anger over the court decision. They were seen on Wednesday on the streets carrying placards with diverse inscriptions and chanting solidarity songs.
