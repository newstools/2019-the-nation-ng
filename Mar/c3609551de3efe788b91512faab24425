Dr Mary Kigho, an Oncologist, Universal Hospital, Benin has advised women to examine their breast frequently for early detection of breast cancer. Kigho, who gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Benin, defined breast cancer as “a cancer that forms lumps in the cells of the breasts.” She said that tests and procedures were the best methods to diagnose early breast cancer. “Women should always examine their breasts to ascertain if there are lumps; they can also visit doctors to check their breasts and lymph nodes in their armpits. “A Mammogram can also be used to detect if a patient has breast cancer. “If breast cancer is detected early, it can be operated upon, but it is difficult to treat if detected late,” she said. Kigho said the symptoms of the disease include, change in breast size or shape, a lump or area that feels thicker than the rest of the breast. She also identified change in skin texture such as puckering or dimpling (like an orange skin) as another symptom of the disease. Others are redness or rash on the skin or around the nipple; nipple becoming pulled and look different, breast pain, swelling in an armpit or around collarbone, according to her. Kigho further urged women with such symptoms to visit doctors immediately, adding that “ early detection saves lives”
