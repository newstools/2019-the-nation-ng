The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, has said that the victory of the candidates of the party in Sokoto and Benue states was an acknowledgement from the people that PDP is the only truly national party in the country. In a congratulatory message to Governors Aminu Tambuwal and Samuel Ortom who have been re-elected in Kano and Benue states respectively, Atiku assured Sokoto state made the right decision that will see them continue on the path to peace, progress and prosperity. Atiku described Governor Ortom’s re-election as well deserved, adding that his re-election was not just a credit to the PDP but also a fact that the governor remained an epitome of servant leadership who he urged electorate in the state to emulate. “With him (Ortom) again at the helm of affairs in Benue, the people of the breadbasket of the nation can look forward to times of refreshing and deliverance,” a statement by his media Adviser, Mr. Paul Ibe said. “Atiku Abubakar shares solidarity with Alhaji Bala Mohammed and Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf, who have made a great showing in Bauchi and Kano states, respectively. “Victory is within reach. They have shown that they are men of the people and we are convinced that much good will come out of these men of enviable talents and leadership ability” The PDP presidential candidate also congratulated his party leaders and members on the gains so far recorded, affirming that the PDP is the true bastion of democracy and should be encouraged by these victories. According to him, with unity within the party, it will together continue to extend the boundaries of democracy and shrink the space occupied by tyranny.
