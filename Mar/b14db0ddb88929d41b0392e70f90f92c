The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) yesterday re-arraigned a Ghanaian, Paul Gyan, at the Federal High Court, Lagos on a three-count charge of drug trafficking. He was arrested at the Departure Hall of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, during the outward clearance of Ethiopian Airlines passengers to Indonesia. The NDLEA said Gyan, 36, concealed 2.02kg of methamphetamine in 10 tomato tins packed in a ‘Ghana-must-go’ sack. He was first arraigned before Justice Babs Kuewumi last year, but the judge was transferred to another division. Gyan pleaded not guilty, but he was denied bail because NDLEA said he posed a flight risk. The defendant was re-arraigned before Justice Maureen Onyetenu. NDLEA counsel Mrs. Juliana Imaobong said the defendant committed the offence on February 25 last year. Justice Onyetenu adjourned till May 13.
