Acting Inspector-General Mohammed Adamu yesterday banned unauthorised use of unmarked vehicles and vehicles with covered number plates. The ban was issued in Abuja yesterday through a statement Force spokesman Frank Mba, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). IG Adamu gave the order following intelligence report that vehicles with covered number plates might be used to commit electoral-related offences before, during and after the rescheduled Governorship and House of Assembly polls on Saturday. According to the police boss, covering of vehicle number plates amounted to a breach of the Road Traffic Act and others laws. IG Adamu said such practices could also impact negatively on national security and heighten criminal activities. He, therefore, directed all Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) and Commissioners of Police (CPs) in the zonal and state commands to strictly enforce the order. The IG warned further that any security personnel found escorting their principals with an unmarked vehicle or covered vehicle number plates, would be arrested and dealt with accordingly. The statement reads: “The IGP gave this order on Tuesday, 5th March, 2019, following intelligence report that the unwholesome practice may be deployed by some unscrupulous persons to aid the commission of electoral related offences before, during and after the Saturday, 9th March, 2019 Gubernatorial/House of Assembly elections. “Apart from the above immediate possible threats to the polls, the IGP also noted that the covering of Vehicle Number Plate amounts to a clear breach of the Road Traffic Act and other relevant laws of the land.”
