Ita Faaji’, a Yoruba phrase for fun arena is what 20 Nigerian cities stand to experience in the next 10 weeks. Those who were part of the 2018 edition of the pan Nigerian show would describe it as a night of pure bliss, providing an unforgettable experience filled with energy, excitement and entertainment for all. The platform which aims at highlighting and celebrating Goldberg’s consumers’ experiences, will host events in major cities like Abuja, Lagos, Warri, Benin, among others, as it did in 2018. A great spectacle of arts and culture, the event involves great music and comedy, just as lucky consumers are given the opportunity to walk away with fantastic prizes. Speaking on the return of ‘Ita Faaji’ for 2019, Brand Manager, Goldberg, Olufunmilayo Ogunbodede says, “Goldberg is passionate about bringing premium experiences to its consumers across Nigeria. Ita Faaji is gems for us, as it allows us connect with consumers across the country giving them an experience they’ll never forget. We can’t wait to tour all the several cities in the coming weeks as we urge everyone to come out and have fun with us.” The brand has, of recent, brought fun-filled nights to consumers through its Unlimited Faaji series from December 2018 to January 2019 and its major music platform Ariya Repete.
