A member of Enugu House of Assembly Matthew Ugwueze has appealed to politicians who lost the Enugu governorship poll not to contest the results in court. Ugwueze, who is the House Committee Chairman on Education and Science and Technology, made the call at a media interaction in Enugu where he also congratulated reelected Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. He also congratulated all the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for recording comprehensive victory in the recently-conducted federal and state elections. The representative of Igbo-Eze South Constituency stated Ugwuanyi’s first tenure witnessed a lengthy legal battle up to the Supreme Court, stressing that the extensive litigation left enormous adverse effects on the state. He praised all the contestants who lost the governorship election for their dexterity, peaceful conduct and display of sportsmanship throughout the entire exercise. According to him: “I appeal to our brothers and sisters who lost the election, especially the governorship, to calm down, join others to accept the result and support the governor-elect to take Enugu State to the next level of development, peace and inclusive governance. “Let us refrain from distracting the incoming administration with litigation. Governor Ugwuanyi’s first tenure was in court for almost four years before it was settled at the Supreme Court. “That was after it had left monumental setback and economic losses to the State.” Ugwueze, who lost his re-election bid at the primaries, was later appointed Campaign Coordinator for Ugwuanyi’s reelection for Igbo-Eze South LGA, which subsequently recorded the highest votes ever in the history of the council area.
