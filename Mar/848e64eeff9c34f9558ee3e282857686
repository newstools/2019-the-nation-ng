A 25-year old student, Hassan Kamal, has appeared before an Ogba Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding a woman of €2,425 (about N1.4million). He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Innocent Odugbo said the defendant committed the offence with one other person, who is at large, between October 22 and 31, 2018 at Oniwaya, Agege, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant collected the foreign currency from Mrs. Zainab Ibrahim with a promise to give her the naira equivalent. Odugbo said the defendant convinced the complainant, who had then just returned from the United Kingdom (UK), to send the money to him. The prosecutor alleged that the student converted the money to his use. Chief Magistrate S. K. Matepo granted the defendant N200,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on March 13.
