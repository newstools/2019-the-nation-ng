Pep Guardiola says Manchester City’s Champions League quarter-final tie against Tottenham is 50/50, but is relaxed ahead of the game Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he is relaxed about the prospect of facing Tottenham three times in 12 days, and says their Champions League tie is “50/50”. City were drawn to play their Premier League rivals in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Friday. The first leg will take place at Spurs‘ new stadium on April 9, with the return leg at the Etihad Stadium on April 17, before a Premier League clash between the pair in Manchester just three days later. That is not something that concerns Guardiola, however, who said: “It happens. It’s a pleasure to be in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. “We know each other quite well. We have a lot of respect. It’s 50/50. We’ll try to get in the best condition possible and try to do a good two games. “Every team has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s the same with us. All I’m concerned with is Tottenham. “Huge respect and I know them quite well. It’s hard, but if you talk about any other team in the Champions League it would be the same.”
