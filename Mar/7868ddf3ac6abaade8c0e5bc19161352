To ensure that no student drops out of school on account of financial and physical constraint, the management of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Akoko, has awarded N1.150 million worth of scholarships to 23 students. They were given N50,000 each. The scholarship scheme was part of various supports measures given to students by the Students’ Support Centre of the university. The scholarships were given to the physically-challenged students. Presenting cheques to the beneficiaries, the Vice Chancellor, Prof Prof Igbekele Ajibefun, who was represented by his Deputy (Academics), Prof Francis Gbore, reiterated the institution’s commitment to assist the awardees. Responding on behalf of others, a 400-Level student of the Department of Mass Communication Boboye Adeusi, appreciated management’s kind gesture. He appealed for the scheme’s continuation, which he described as a model and ideal initiative that should be emulated by other institutions. Earlier, Students’ Support Centre coordinator, Dr Adediran Ikuomola, said the institution values all students as demonstrated through the scholarship. He said the centre would continue to work on the challenges faced by the students and explore more creative ways to make the centre more functional.
