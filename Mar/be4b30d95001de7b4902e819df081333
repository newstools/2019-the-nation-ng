A Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has sacked Dumo Lulu-Briggs as Rivers State governorship candidate of the Accord Party. The court declared Precious Baridoo, who was nominated in the October 4, 2018 primaries, as the party’s authentic candidate. Justice Emmanuel Obile said Lulu-Briggs cannot participate in the governorship election because he is not the party’s candidate. According to him, Lulu-Briggs did not participate in the party’s October 4, 2018 governorship primary. The court said the defendants failed to challenge the affidavit of the plaintiff to controvert the facts contained therein. Justice Obile also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to enlist Precious Baridoo as the Rivers State governorship candidate of Accord Party. Baridoo’s lawyer, Wori Wori, described the judgment as victory for democracy. He said the rules of political engagement must be respected. But Lulu-Briggs’s lawyer said they will challenge the judgment at the Court of Appeal.
