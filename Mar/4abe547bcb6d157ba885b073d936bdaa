The League Bloggers Awards (LBA) has shortlisted four players and four coaches to vie for the February player and manager’s awards in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Abdulrahman Bashir of Enyimba, Tasiu Lawal of Katsina United, Fuad Ekelojuoti of Sunshine Stars and Mfon Udoh of Akwa United are the nominees for the player’s award for the month under review. The nominees for the player’s award represent the massive attacking contribution for the month of February which produced 111 goals of the 194 total so far in the NPFL this season. Bashir, Ekelojuoti and Lawal scored three goals each in the month under review with the pair of Ekelojuoti and Lawal weighing in with an assist each. Akwa United’s Udoh netted four times and got two assists. In the manager’s list for honour are Fidelis Ilechukwu of MFM FC, Rafael Everton of Akwa United, Usman Abd’Allah of Enyimba and Ibrahim Musa of Kano Pillars. Everton and Ilechukwu led Akwa United and MFM FC respectively to unbeaten outings in February to finish among the pacesetters in both groups of the top division. Abd’Allah helped Enyimba reach double figures of points in February after three wins and a draw with a defeat at Wikki Tourists while Musa, who made a return to the dugout for Kano Pillars, ensured the four-time champions claimed nine out of 12 points available to them last month. The winners for February will be announced next week.
