Archbishop of Onitsha Metropolitan, Most Rev. Valerian Okeke, has rewarded six female pupils of Regina Pacis Model School, Onitsha, Anambra State who wowed the world with their Technovation win in the United States, last August. The pupils and their mentor, Mrs Uche Onwuamaegbu, got N100, 000 each from the cleric. Their school and teachers were not left out as the Bishop also donated 10 laptops to the school, as well as N10, 000 each to its teachers. A pupil who answered the question the cleric posed during his homily was offered scholarship. Speaking during his pastoral visit to the school, Bishop Okeke was full of thanks to God for the success. He said: “We thank the Almighty God for the good work he performed through the students and the mentor that went to the competition with them. “They brought home five gold medals as the first position in the entire world. I pray they hold on to the good work.” Governor Willie Obiano, represented by the Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Kate Omenugha, thanked the pupils, encouraging them to continue to put in their best in their studies.
