Acting Registrar, National Examinations Council (NECO), Abubakar Gana, has said the council could be self-sufficient without allocation from the Federation Account because of the prudent way the council is managing its resources. Gana, disclosed this during the agency’s budget defense before the Senate Committee on Basic Education in Abuja. The registrar, in a statement Thursday, called for the support of the Senate to achieve the self-sufficiency target of the agency. The Registrar expressed commitment to deepen the gains recorded within his stint in office, stating that the agency under his supervision was poised to take its place as a transparent body. He disclosed that the council also returned about N1 billion to the nation’s Consolidated Revenue Account as operational surplus from its internally generated revenue (IGR). The NECO boss expressed his desire to firm up the reforms being carried out in the agency, adding that the 2019 budget of the agency as presented to the National Assembly will be judiciously implemented. The Chairman of the committee, Sen. Aliyu Wamako, commended the agency for effectively deploying and utilising resources allocated to it for the conduct of examinations across the country. Wamako disclosed that in the 2018 budget, the leadership of NECO returned about N90 million unused overhead allocations into the consolidated account. While stating that NECO was borrowing a lift from the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, by prudently managing its resources, the Senator expressed confidence in the agency to further apply its 2019 appropriation to reasonable use.
