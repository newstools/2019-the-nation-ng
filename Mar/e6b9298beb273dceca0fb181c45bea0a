Hip hop mega star, Davido, is set to feature at Kayafest this April in the United States. Kaya Fest derives from ‘Kaya,’ the title of an album by Bob Marley and the event is a one-day Music and Awareness Festival to celebrate unity. In 2017, it was named one of the Top 10 Music Moments by Miami New Times. Davido shared the news of his performance at the event via his Instagram handle. “MIAMI !!!! April 20th! 4/20,” he wrote as he shared the poster. This year’s event is scheduled to hold on April 20, 2019 at the Bayfront Park Amphitheatre in Miami, Florida. It will feature some of Bob Marley’s children like Stephen, Ziggy, Damian, Julian and Ky-Mani. Others acts to perform include Busta Rhymes, Sean Paul, Chi Ching Ching, Protoje, Third World, Kes The Band and Walshy Fire of Major Lazer. The rest are Koffee, Skip Marley, Yohan Marley, Mystic Marley, Yardcore, DJ Rassarella, Silent Addy and others. According to the organisers, each year Kaya Fest invites an incredible roster of reggae-influenced artists to celebrate one love, unity, peace and “overstanding” alongside supporters from all over the world. “When we touch the stage as the brothers it’s very unique,” said Stephen Marley “The whole energy of us on stage at once is a great vibe. It’s for all of us, the people. During Kaya Fest, we are one.”
