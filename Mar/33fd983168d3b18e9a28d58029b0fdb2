Should Justice Adedayo Akintoye of the Lagos High Court discountenance the conjessional statements of female lawyer, Udeme Otike-Odibi, accused of killing her husband Symphorosa on May 3, last year. The court is to conduct a trial-within-trial to determine whether or not to reject the statement. The defendant through her counsel Oluseye Banjoko prayed the court to reject the statements, but the prosecutor, Babatunde Sunmonu, demanded for a trial-within-trial to determine the action to take. Banjoko urged the court to reject the statements, because the the law was not followed in obtaining them from his client. The statements, he said,  were not obtained in accordance with Section 93 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL) of Lagos State, 2015.
