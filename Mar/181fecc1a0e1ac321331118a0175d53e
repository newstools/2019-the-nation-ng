Ahead the kick-off of the new Nigeria Nation-Wide League One (NLO) season, Magate FC is set to sign 30 players after it concluded a 3-day screening programme in Lagos on Monday. No fewer than 120 grassroot players took part in the scouting programme which began last week Saturday at the Alade Stadium, Command-Ipaja, Lagos. Coach Olanrewaju Yemi Daniel commended the management of the club for giving him the free hands to select the players who were picked on merit. “It’s been a tough three days for me, the turn out has been fantastic as each and every player that took part in the screening, gave a good account of themselves. “The quality and skills from many of them is quite commendable but I can only do with 26 or 30 players. This I have got after the exercise. “Without bias to anyone, the players we have selected were purely on merit as they met with the standard we have set. “Now that the screening is over, the second phase will be working with the 30 players on tactics and pattern of football we want to play this season. “I should use from now till next two weeks to drill the players, with a view of getting ready to take on any team in tune-up games.” The Head Coach of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN Selected) gave kudos to the management of Magate FC for the role it played during the screening exercise. “I am very impressed with my employers as they acted professionally during the screening programme as I was given a free hand to select the 30 players.” Magate FC General Manager, Owolabi Aleshinloye said the club will be ready in time for the NLO kickoff. “I was impressed with the turn-out and quality from the players. “The third day of screening was most exciting for me as I saw the best from many of these youngsters. “From what I saw today and what I think the team would look like in the next two weeks, Magate FC will be ready to compete well in the NLO this season,” Aleshinloye said.
