Kubeinje also ordered 28-year-old Olamide Adesoko to produce two sureties in like sum. She directed that the sureties must be gainfully employed and provide evidence of one year tax payment to the state government. The defendant, a resident of Adebimpe Street, Mile 12, Lagos State, was arraigned over alleged  conspiracy and  stealing which respectively contravene Sections 285 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. He, however, denied committing the offences. The Prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, submitted that the defendant conspired with others still at large to snatch an iPhone worth N46, 000 from one Mr Tunde Ibrahim. Ihiehie told the court that the unemployed committed the offences on Feb 16. at 3.00p.m. at Mile 12 Bus Stop. He alleged that the defendant approached Ibrahim, claiming that he needed direction to a place. “Before the complainant knew what was happening, Adesoko held him and snatched his phone,” Ihiehie said. He said that Ibrahim saw the defendant two days later while attempting to defraud a woman. “He raised alarm, and people around caught him and handed him over to the police.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stealing attracts three years’ imprisonment but stealing from one’s employer is punishable with seven years’ imprisonment, under the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
