The Federal High Court sitting in Benin City has sacked Mr. Osaro Obaze as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Oredo East Constituency in the House of Assembly election scheduled to hold this Saturday. Justice Damilola Ajayi in his ruling upheld Mr. Ekhosuehi Aiguobahi as the legitimate candidate of the APC. Ekhosuehi has filed the case asking the court to name him as the duly elected candidate of the APC for Oredo East Constituency. Justice Ajayi ruled that Ekhosuehi won last year primary of the party and therefore remains the rightful candidate for the March 9 election. Reacting to the judgment, Obaze said he was unfazed by the court judgment as he has put machinery in motion to appeal the decision. He said he remained the party’s candidate for the election. “My supporters should come out enmasse to vote for me on Saturday. I have the INEC form which was given to me as the candidate who won the primary. They should remain calm.” Edo State spokesman of the APC, Mr. Chris Azebamwan, said Obaze remained the party’s candidate for the constituency. “We hereby re-affirm Obaze as the candidate of the APC in Oredo East Constituency, and hereby reassure our teeming supporters to keep faith and remain steadfast. The leadership of our great party will do everything necessary, and explore all legal options to ensure that the mandate which we collectively gave Obaze to fly our flag in the election of Saturday, March 9 remains inviolate.”
