Youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos state on Monday urged Lagosians to vote massively for Babajide Sanwo-Olu,in the Saturday gubernatorial election.

According to him, a win for the APC is a blow struck for a grander and vibrant Lagos, as he strongly believes in the intellectual capacity of Sanwo-Olu and Obafemi Hamzat to drive Lagos to a greater height, create opportunities for all and strengthen the fabric of unity existing in the state. ‘And these are the breeds of leaders that we need and not some misguided elements with uniformed sense of reasoning,” Argebe stressed. In the same vein, the youths condemned the People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) gubernatorial candidate, Jimi Agbaje, noting that Lagos is too sophisticated to propagate unholy sermons of discord and enmity against the backdrop of personal gains. “A man who lacks loyalty, who sees politics as a business transaction shouldn’t and must not be taken seriously. There’s absolutely no doubt that some people do not mean well for Lagos and Jimi Agbaje is certainly one of them.
