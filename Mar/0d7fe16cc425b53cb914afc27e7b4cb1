The Anambra State government has debunked rumours that it plans to restrict operations of commercial motorcyclists, popularly called Okada in Nnewi, Anambra State. The Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, described the rumour as politically-motivated. According to him, the government would never contemplate such. He said: “There is no iota of truth in the rumours that the government plans to ban okada in Nnewi. The government has always made it clear that Nnewi would not be affected when the restriction order on the use of commercial motorcycles in Onitsha and Awka was made mid last year.” According to the commissioner, the rumour ban was started by politically-exposed persons participating in the elections. He advised politicians to insist on the truth while passing information to their followers so as not to mislead them.
