FINAL-LIST-OF-STATE-HOUSE-OF-ASSEMBLY-CANDIDATES-1 (1) In addition to the state elections into 1,082 constituencies nationwide, INEC is also conducting supplementary elections in 14 States covering seven Senatorial Districts and 24 Federal Constituencies, alongside the Governorship and State Assembly elections. NAN recalls that the elections in the affected areas were disrupted mainly by acts of violence including ballot box snatching, abduction of INEC officials, over voting and failure to adhere to regulations and guidelines in the national elections conducted on Feb. 23. While cancelling the affected polls, the electoral ombudsman noted that number of registered voters in some polling units involved in each constituency was more than the votes received by some candidates with the highest number of votes, hence the need for supplementary elections to determine the actual winners. The election will hold at 119,973 polling units across the country, while collation of results will take place in 8,809 Registration Areas or Wards, 774 Local Government Areas, 36 States and the FCT. The polling units are expected to open by 8 a.m. and close by 2 p.m. with the last person on the line allowed to vote. INEC maintains that the use of Smart Card Readers and Permanent Voter Cards were compulsory for the elections. The commission says the total number of registered voters in the country is 84,004,084, with 44,405,439 (52.86 per cent) as male and 39,598,645 (47.14 per cent) as female. It also said that 72,775,502 or 86.63 per cent of registered voters have collected their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). The INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has expressed confidence that all polling units would open at 8 a.m. nationwide. Yakubu said that the commission had effectively tackled the challenge of logistics as materials for the election have been earlier delivered to all States and the FCT. Meanwhile, INEC has postponed the House of Assembly Election for the Nasarawa/Binyeri State Constituency of Mayo Belwa Local Government Area in Adamawa following the death of a member of the assembly, Mr Adamu Kwanate, who was candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election. Until his death on Wednesday, Kwanate was the member representing the affected state constituency. (NAN)
