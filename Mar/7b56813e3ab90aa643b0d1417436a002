Victor Osimhen’s sensational hat-trick saw Nigeria U23 through to the U23 Africa Cup of Nations after defeating Libya U23 4-0 in the second leg of their double-header qualifying tie at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on Monday. It will be recalled that The Dream Team VII began the AFCON U-23 double-header qualifier against Libya on a wrong foot, going down 2-0 away at the Stade de Ben Guerdane, Libya. David Okereke netted the fourth goal at the 90’+3 minutes to seal the victory.
