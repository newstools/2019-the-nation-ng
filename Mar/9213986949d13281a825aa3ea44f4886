Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has approved the payment of administrative charges of over N24million to school Principals. Fayemi approved the funds for 13,390 candidates who will be writing the April/May 2019 West Africa Senior School Certificate Examination in the Public Secondary Schools in the State. In furtherance of his free and compulsory education policy, Fayemi had earlier paid the WASSSCE fees for all students in the state’s public schools. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Ayodeji Ajayi, who disclosed this on Friday in Ado Ekiti, the State capital, added that the government has decided to completely change the face of education. Ajayi, however, disclosed that Vice Principals that have served for over twenty years would henceforth be engaged in supervision of Ceritificate Examinations in the State. He said: ” The State Government has paid the sum of N1, 850 (One thousand Eight hundred and Fifty Naira) per student for 13,390 candidates to take care of administrative charges and incidental expenses during the examination. “Any school involved in examination malpractices would be punished in accordance with the law”, he warned. The Permanent Secretary added that the state government has a zero tolerance for examination malpractice. He called on Principals in the state not to collect any money from any candidate that would write the SSCE Examination now that government has taken care of all required expenses.
