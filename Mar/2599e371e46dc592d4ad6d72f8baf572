 Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp faith in Nigerian international Daniel Akpeyi paid off on Saturday as the Chiefs ran away with a 3-2 win over Highlands Park in Durban. Akpeyi who doubles as Super Eagles goalkeeper was largely blamed for the 1-1 draw recorded by the club against Polokwane City last Saturday as he allowed an effort from long range to slide under his body, in what some of the fans described as preventable error. The coach however insisted that the error was normal and nothing to raise alarm about predicting that the Nigerian will bounce back and true to his prediction Akpeyi rose to the occasion against Highlands. “I only hope that he has the right mentality to bounce back, and not getting any effects by it,” Middendorp is quoted as saying by TimesLive. Akpeyi conceded two goals in the 41st and 77th minute of the match while denying Highlands other scoring opportunity.  Kaizer Chiefs grabbed two goals in the first half and consolidated with a 71st minute third goal. Kaizer Chiefs will next face Maritzburg United next Saturday.  Akpeyi no doubt will be happy to be enjoying the confidence of his coach who believes that on a good day he knows exactly how to get it right. “I am quite convinced that he knows that he has to do it in a proper way, “enthused an elated Middendorp
