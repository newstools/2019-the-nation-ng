Former France midfielder and captain Zinedine Zidane has been reappointed as coach at Real Madrid, after the Spanish La Liga side sacked Santiago Solari on Monday. Zidane won an unprecedented three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles with the Spanish giants before resigning in May last year. Julen Lopetegui who replaced him was sacked in October, with Solari his replacement lasting just over four months in charge. A club statement confirmed Solari’s sacking and said Zidane’s appointment was with immediate effect. It added that the 46-year-old would be in charge for the rest of the season and three more seasons until 2022. (NAN)
