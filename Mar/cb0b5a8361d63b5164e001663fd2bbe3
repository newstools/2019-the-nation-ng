AFRO Pop artiste, Adeyelu Ayooluwakunle,  aka Spicy, has revealed how a Lagos drama which he witnessed inspired his new single “In My Head”. According to the Concordebon Entertainment act, “I was inspired by a little drama I saw somewhere in Lagos…I heard a guy expressing the feelings he has for a girl to his friends and… let me keep the rest a secret…I’m sure you all know what that scene will look like…That’s where the song came from”. Shot by promising video director, Solomon Usuanlele, in Ikorodu, Lagos, ‘In My Head’ video has however, been released and it is enjoying airplay on several television stations. ‘In My Head’ is a love song that tells the story of a young man that fell in love with a lady and would do anything to make her his girl forever. The video tells the story of a young man who went on trance to meet the woman he loves and they lived happily until he woke up. “The song was delivered on a Sylaz made Afro beat mixed and mastered by PrimeMix and I can tell you that it’s a tune y’all need to listen to,” said Spicy. Speaking on how long it takes him to compose a song, Spicy said “if you ask every artiste out there how long it takes to compose a song they will tell you it’s not something you can do within the twinkle of an eye…It starts from when you get the idea or concept of what you want to sing about then gradually you’ll develop it into lyrics and then you make it a song.”
