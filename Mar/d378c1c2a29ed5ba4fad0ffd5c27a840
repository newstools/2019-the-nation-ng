Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Monday in Kano said he is ever ready to face the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which vowed to challenge his victory at the just- concluded Kano supplementary poll in court. He said: “Before the re-run election, which we emerged victorious, they were deep-neck in ballot stuffing and other electoral offences, a ploy that was later uncovered.” The governor spoke in Ganduje town of Dawakin Tofa local government when he was receiving thousands of supporters who trooped to congratulate him over his re-election. Ganduje said it was after that ballot stuffing scenario that genuine election was conducted at the supplementary election, which he described as fair and credible. “My thinking about these people is they are about to kick-start what would later consume them unawares. “What they did in other elections of the state legislators in some places, will be looked at, with the view to ascertaining authenticity of such votes they claimed to have gotten,” Ganduje further stated. While assuring his second term in office would build on the good work he has done to the state, he boasted: “Whoever comes to Kano will attest to the fact that Kano is fast growing and developing. “We will improve on this and will, at the same time, consolidate the feats achieved.” The governor commended those that trooped to congratulate him and his government over the victory and assured them his administration would continue to make Kano one of the safest states in the country. “We are thanking those who voted for us, those who didn’t vote for us and those who didn’t even vote at all,” he stated.
