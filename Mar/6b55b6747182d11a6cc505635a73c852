An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court  yesterday remanded a 42-year-old driver, Omoruyi Aderemilekun, in Kirikiri Prisons  allegedly defiling a 10-year-old girl. Magistrate B. O. Osunsanmi declined to take the defendant’s plea, pending advice by Lagos State  Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Prosecuting Inspector Raphael Donny said the defendant committed the offence on January 21 at 263, Ijesha Road, Ijeshatedo, Surulere, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant unlawfully had carnal knowledge of the minor. “The defendant came to eat for the second time in the shop where the girl was helping her sister to sell food. “After he finished eating, he asked the girl to follow him to collect the money inside his vehicle, claiming he did not have money in his pocket. “On getting to the vehicle, he forcefully pushed the girl inside. She shouted, but nobody was around to rescue her. “The defendant covered her mouth with a rag, forcefully removed her pant and had sex with her,” the prosecutor alleged. He said the minor’s sister at that moment called out her name when she took long in coming back. “When the girl’s sister was shouting her name, searching for her, the girl forcefully removed the rag from her mouth and raised the alarm, which attracted her sister. “Her sister rushed to the vehicle in front of her shop and saw her sister being abused. “The sister called the police and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. The case continues on April 3.
