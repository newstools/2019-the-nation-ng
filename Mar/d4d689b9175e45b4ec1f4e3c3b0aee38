Comic actor, John Okafor, popularly known as Mr Ibu, has advised students to discover themselves early and choose the careers most suitable for them. Ibu gave this advice during an interactive session with Mass Communication students of Benson Idahosa University. According to him, students should identify what they have passion for as this will help them make the right choice and choose the career that fits into their character. “If you don’t have a passion for a particular career, one should not venture into it,” he said. “Your friend is doing something and you like what he or she is doing but it is not in your body, don’t push yourself into doing it because the result may not be satisfactory.” Asked what other career he would have chosen besides comic acting, Mr. Ibu said he would have been a professional dancer even though he sings well. He further admonished the students to believe in their dreams and strive to be the best as they still have time on their side. The Vice Chancellor of Benson Idahosa University, Prof. Sam Guobadia, thanked the Nollywood actor for coming to share his wealth of experience and wisdom with the students.
