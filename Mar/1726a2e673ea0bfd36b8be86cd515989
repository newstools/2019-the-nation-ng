Edo State Commissioner of Police, Damallam Abubakar, has explained why he is yet to parade suspected killers of four police personnel in Afuze, headquarters of Owan East local government area. Gunmen had March 13 attacked the Afuze Police Division and the secretariat of the Independent National Electoral Commission in the area with explosives and shot sporadically. They killed the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Ojo Kosenami and an expectant police officer, Sergeant Justina Aghomon, Inspector Sado Isaac and Corporal Glory David. The gunmen asked them to remove their uniforms before killing them after which they locked them in a room. Danmallam who spoke to newsmen Friday on the incident said operatives have arrested 13 suspects in connection with the killing of DPO and three other officers at Afuze police station. The Edo Police boss declined to give further details until other suspects at large are arrested. “On the 12 of March, 2019, where some unknown criminals, cowards who went to hide under cover of darkness, attacked Afuze Police station, killed the DPO and three others. “If you recalled my press conference with the executive governor of Edo State, Governor Obaseki, I promised the public that we will do everything within the ambit of the law to detect and apprehend the criminals. “We succeeded in the sense that we have 13 suspects under our custody. “The reason I do not want to parade them is that they are making useful information and I do not want anything that will jeopardize our investigations. We made arrest and they have confessed to have participated in the operation where they killed the DPO and the three others,” he said.
