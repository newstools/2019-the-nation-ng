Kano Electricity Distribution Plc. (KEDCO) has deployed more technology-based revenue collection to discourage incessant cash handling especially by the Sales Representatives in the company. The initiative, which is driven by the Revenue Assurance Department in collaboration with Corporate Communication unit of the firm, was aimed at curtailing fraudulent activities and encourage transparency, trustworthiness and steadfastness in the process of revenue collection. In a statement by the company spokesman, Mohammed Kandi, it quoted the Ag. Head of Corporate Communication, Sani Bala Sani as saying “we have realized that, the use of POS, online vending and direct payment to KEDCO’s various cash points had proven to be more efficient and more reliable over the years. Sani affirmed that technology-based revenue was trending globally, and noted that, such practice would enhance KEDCO’s revenue drive. “We have discovered during one of our community engagements to Danbare, a sub-hub in Kabuga/Bayero University community, which receives at least 18-20 hours of power supply that, there has been consistent shortfalls in cash collection partly due to customers’ laxity in taking advantage of various payment options already advertised by the company,” Sani disclosed. While insisting that the communications unit was an integral part of KEDCO’s revenue drive, Sani also hinted that, he would continue to lead his team to carry out more engagements so as to expose the irregularities being perpetrated by staff and customers alike. He stated that the effort was a double-edged sword that would be used to sanitise the system on one hand, and on the other boost revenue collection.
