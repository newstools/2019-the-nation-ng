Victoria Emezue, a student of Vocational Training Centre for the blind, Oshodi has said that discrimination against physically challenged persons killed faster than the disability. Emezue told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of the 24th annual inter-house sports of the school at Yaba College of Technology on Thursday that she got depressed after losing her friends. She said all her friends deserted her when she got blind in 2014 and that got her depressed more than her predicament. “I lost all my friends when I became blind, I was in secondary school when I discover my eye condition in 2013 and became blind in 2014. “You know being a friend to all is good but when they saw that I cannot see anymore and do things like them, they pulled away, it was only one girl that stood by me and she is still close. “Joining the Vocational Training Centre has been great for me, I have learnt so many things like how to walk alone, read and write. “I am now free unlike before when I was depressed, I was always isolating myself but now, there is no one that can pull me down because I am blind,’’ she said. Emezue, who was the captain of Red House at the inter-house sports, said that she felt fulfilled participating in three events like bowling, rounders game and march past. “It felt great to participate in sport, I just wanted to catch fun and I enjoyed myself,’’ she said. Emezue appealed to the physically challenged in the society not to let anyone pull them down, saying that it was only a dead mind that could not move on in life. “Don’t look down on yourself, always believe that there is something that you can do, there is an ability even in that disability and be determined that you can make it in life,’’ she said.
