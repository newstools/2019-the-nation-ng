The cash was allegedly withdrawn in three tranches for vote buying between Tuesday and Thursday. But the suspect, who was arrested on Thursday, was in custody as at press time. It was gathered that the EFCC is already probing whether or not the cash was mopped up on the order of the governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha A top source, who spoke in confidence, said: “We have intelligence report that cash was withdrawn through a new generation bank for use by the state government. “Casmir’s arrest followed intelligence report that the state government intended to use the money for vote buying in favour of a particular candidate in Saturday’s gubernatorial election. “Intelligence further revealed that Casmir withdrew the amount in three tranches between Tuesday and Thursday this week in the following order; N200million on Tuesday N500million on Wednesday and N350million on Thursday.” The source claimed that the EFCC has taken pre-emptive steps to stop further withdrawal from the affected accounts.
