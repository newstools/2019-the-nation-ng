FORMER Nigerian President and self-appointed supervisor of Nigerian leaders, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, made his first public comment at his Abeokuta hill-top home on Tuesday since the conclusion of the presidential election in which his candidate and former deputy, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, was roundly beaten by President Muhammadu Buhari to secure his second term. The former president found the occasion of his 82nd birthday celebration where his usual crowd of friends and political associates were gathered a momentous one to break his long silence after the painful loss suffered by him and his candidate in the election. Responding to an appeal by the Alake of Egba, Oba Michael Adedotun Gbadebo, that the former president should stop attacking President Buhari, Obasanjo, in his usual bravura, boasted that he remains Buhari’s boss and vowed to continue attacking the sitting president until he heeds his series of advice. Many had thought that he would comment on the election, its outcome, conduct and developments thereafter, but he chose not. Days earlier in the United Kingdom, the former president skillfully parried a question on Atiku’s defeat in a dramatic encounter he had with a young Nigerian based in the UK. The young man was said to have set Obasanjo’s head swollen by prostrating for him in the full glare of hundreds of Britons who were gathered at the airport where they met. Moved by the young Nigerian’s show of cultural discipline, Obasanjo dragged him up, hugged him and wasted no time yielding to the young man’s request for a photograph. Apparently taking advantage of the former President’s happy mood, the young man proceeded to ask him his opinion about the just concluded presidential election in which Atiku lost against Buhari in spite of the open support Obasanjo canvassed for the former. The question apparently caught Obasanjo unaware as he was said to look away from his interlocutor, hissed and declared in a calm, subdued voice: “Nigeria will be good.”
