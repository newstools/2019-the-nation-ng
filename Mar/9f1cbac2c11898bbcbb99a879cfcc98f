To commemorate World Kidney Day which holds on March 14th of every year, OAP Emma Ugolee, has implored people to run a renal function test so as to know the state of their kidney. The OAP said one can lose 80% of the kidney function without a single symptom. “This is not a curse,” he said. “It is an all reality statement of fact. You would be told that you must spend a minimum of 12hours weekly having your blood be drained out, purified and returned  every two days. This would cost you averagely N100k a week or N1m in 2months and 2weeks or you would die. “Being able to afford this, you would still find discoloration of your face, difficulty with keeping physical balance, frequent hospital trips and procedures, easy susceptibility to infection, steady nausea, regular bloating, and daily popping of a huge collection of pills.” Going further, he stated: “Your pursuit and need for money would be constant. The result of ignoring this can be fatal. Alot of your loved ones would look for the shortest routes out of your life, you would know disrespect from the least expected and undeserving quarters, you would need unusual strength to stay emotionally balanced, you would meet and be close with alot of people going through something similar but many of them would die. At one point suicide may seem like a welcome option. “It would all begin to happen to you after a doctor tells you: “I am sorry you have lost your kidneys” if you do not get concerned about the state of your kidneys. There’s is more. Too much more to mention here but one more i must mention is the National Association of Kidney Doctors statistics that confirms that almost 40million Nigerians already have kidney related issues. Anybody can suffer from Kidney disease. You do not want to be one of them.” Ugolee nearly gave up on life after discovering a lump that later turned out to benign. He later beat a kidney disease that almost claimed his life in 2018.
