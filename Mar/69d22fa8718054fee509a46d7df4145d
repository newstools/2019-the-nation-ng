A woman, Aisha Isah, on Thursday dragged her father, Isah Ibrahim to a Shari’a Court l, sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna, for allegedly forcing her into marriage and locking up her house. The complainant, who resides at Kadaure area of Kaduna, told the court that her father, who had been pressuring her into marriage, also had her house locked up for defying his order. Aisha pleaded with the court to order her father to unlock her house. She also prayed the court to restrain her father from further pressuring her into marriage so that she could marry the right man at the right time. Ibrahim denied the allegation, saying he only asked his daughter to choose and marry from the numerous suitors coming to seek her hand in marriage. The respondent, however, said he had to lock up her house because of the kinds of people she kept company of. “People have been saying it to my face that my daughter brings all kinds of men to the house; that was why I locked the house because no responsible father will allow that,’’ he told the court. The Judge, Malam Dahiru Lawal, after listening to both parties ordered the complainant to make peace with her father and avoid all kind of vices likely to tarnish her family’s image. The judge urged the father to be patient with his daughter and follow the right way of giving out his daughter in marriage in accordance with the Shari’a law. He adjourned ruling until March 20. NAN
