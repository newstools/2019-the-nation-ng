The police in Lagos have arrested a 20-year-old tricyclist John Babalola for allegedly raping a teenager (names withheld). Babalola was arrested on March 15 by the Family Support Unit (FSU) at Iju Ishaga Division. It was gathered that following the suspect’s arrest, his friends had taken to threatening the survivor and her father.
According to the Child Protection Network (CPN), the teenager was raped while her mother was terminally ill and the woman passed on Tuesday morning. CPN said Babalola’s friends have mobilised to threaten the girl’s father that they will kill him or chase him out of the area. “The perpetrator ran away after the act but later surrendered himself at the Iju Police Division where he was detained. We understand that the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) was doing her best to ensure justice. “The survivor’s mother passed on today (Tuesday) and despite the family was in mourning, the perpetrator’s friends have mobilised to threaten the girl’s father that they’ll kill him or chase him out of the area. “A quick intervention is needed to keep the survivor and her family safe and to ensure that justice is served,” said the group. Confirming the incident, police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the case was under investigation, adding that the police would also investigate alleged threats to the survivor, her father by the suspect and his friends.
