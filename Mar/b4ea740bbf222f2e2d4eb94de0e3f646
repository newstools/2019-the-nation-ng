The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) on Tuesday endorsed Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State as its candidate for the governorship poll on Saturday. The flag bearer of APGA in the State, Alh. Adamu Bako Dan Ibrahim, also stepped down for the governor, at a public event held at the Jolly Nyame stadium in Jalingo. “My decision to step down followed series of consultations which proved to me that Governor Ishaku is the right candidate for this job and he deserves a second term. “I have decided to support his reelection so that he can continue with the great works he started. And Taraba must be entrusted into safe hands,” Ibrahim said. The State Chairman of APGA also assured Ishaku of unalloyed support by his party supporters during the election, adding he had consulted them and they agreed to vote for the governor. Ishaku said he was overwhelmed with joy over the support. He noted that the election was all about Taraba, so he will not disappoint them after victory. “We must all come together and build a peaceful Taraba. And I assure you we shall run an all-inclusive government. “I am optimistic that come Saturday, March 9, you will all join me in a Dance of Victory, because victory is certain, and together, with God no one can stop us,” Ishaku said.
