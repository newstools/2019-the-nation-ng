Gunmen on Wednesday attacked vehicles along the AkwangaAkwanga-Akwanga-Keffi Expressway, kidnapping four women. Yahanasu, wife of the Chairman of Correspondents’ Chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists, Nasarawa State Council, Suleiman Abubakar, was among those kidnapped. Abubakar told reporters that the incident occurred around 7pm on Gudi-Garaku Road in Akwanga Local Government. He said the gunmen shot at the union bus they were travelling in from Keffi, where his wife had gone to register at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp. Abubakar said the bus ran into a ditch after it was shot at, which gave the gunmen the opportunity to abduct his wife, the wife of a former state assembly member, who was on the bus as well as two other women from another vehicle. Police spokesman Samaila Usman, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP),  said the command had mobilised officers to rescue the victims.
