A chief Magistrates Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State has ordered the remand in prison custody of 31-year-old man, Yusuf Lawan for alleged armed robbery. The suspect and others presently at large allegedly robbed one Chief Seleipiri Bob-Manuel of his belongings valued at N810,000 while armed with matchetes and Kitchen knives. A document obtained from the court alleged that the suspect and his accomplices dispossessed their victim of his 42″ plasma LG television valued at N350,000, Samsung S+8 phone valued at N250,000, Samsung S+6 phone valued at N200,000 and a DSTV decoder valued at  N10,000. The two-count charge of armed robbery levelled against him was not read out to him; the court apparently lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter which according to the criminal code falls within the capital offence charge, hence he did not take plea. The offence was committed on March 5, 2019 at Woji community area of Obio/Akpor Local Governmnet Area of the state. The presiding chief Magistrate,  Sokari Andrew-Jaja ordered that the suspect be remanded in prison custody and his original case file be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for advice. The chief Magistrate later adjourned till April 22 for report of DPP advice.
