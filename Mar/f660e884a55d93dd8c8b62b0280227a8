A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Cee-Hope, has asked the Lagos State Government to  prosecute violators of building laws. Its Executive Director, Betty Abbah, said in a statement yesterday: “We commiserate with the families who have lost children and relations in the collapsed Lagos Island building. “According to media reports, about 18 persons, mostly children, died while 41 were rescued, with several of them sustaining injuries. These casualties, these heart-wrenching pains are avoidable- a result of the pervasive lawlessness in our society. “We, therefore, ask for a speedy investigation and dispensing of the most stringent punishment for violators of building codes and regulations that led to this avoidable loss of lives. “A society is only taken seriously when there is adherence to set rules and regulations, especially when it concerns safety of the most vulnerable, in this case children.’’
