The Vice Chancellor, Ladoke Akintola University (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, Prof Michael Ologunde, has charged 59 medical laboratory science graduates of the institution to discharge their duties diligently and live up to the oath the profession. Speaking during the 10th induction of laboratory science graduates at the College of Health Sciences of LAUTECH in Osogbo, Osun State, Ologunde reminded the inductees that their professional body, the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MESCN), would monitor their disposition to societal needs on good health delivery and globally acceptable professional conduct. “As you journey through life, be determined to be good to people and plan to be good achievers. The Almighty God, who has seen you thus far will not leave you alone. You are meant for a greater height and you will get there. I congratulate you for the laudable foundation that you have laid for a better tomorrow and it shall be well with you. Always remember that you are responsible for whatever you become in life and you shall make positive on your generation,” he said. He acknowledged the contribution of the College of Health Sciences in the effort to put the LAUTECH on a “good pedestal with acceptable best practices.” In his speech, the Provost of the College, Prof. S.S. Taiwo, thanked the two owner states of the institution, Osun and Oyo, for their support. He noted that LAUTECH was facing some challenges, especially poor funding, which he said was largely informed by the downturn in the nation’s economy. He also expressed hope that the university would overcome indiscriminate interruption of its academic calendar occasionally caused by industrial actions of the university’s labour unions.
