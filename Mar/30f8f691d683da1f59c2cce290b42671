Girls and Youth Re-integration Network (GYRIN) an NGO, has expressed concern over the rising cases of drug abuse in the country. Miss Kehinde Awojola, the Founder of GYRIN, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday, in Abuja, that the NGO was receiving alarming reports of drug abuse daily. Awojola said that reports of incessant cases of drug abuse in the country was worrisome; adding that no effort should be spared to curb the menace. She noted that the issue should be of grave concern to all as youths, who were supposed to be the future of the country, were mostly drug addicts. The founder said the NGO planned to embark on a street campaign against drug abuse; and also take the message to some selected schools in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “We need to create awareness on the health and social consequences of drug abuse; the drug abusers need professional counselling. “Government should try to do more by conducting intensive awareness programmes on the ills and dangers of drug abuse to socio-economic development,’’ She said. She also tasked community leaders on the sensitisation of the people in their communities, on the harmful effects of drug abuse. Awojola also called on the government to adopt a more comprehensive policy and strategy that would help curb the menace.
