The out-of-court settlement embarked upon by parties in a suit filed by 14 students of the International School, Ibadan (ISI) on behalf of the ISI Muslim Parents Forum, to contest restriction of the use of hijab on uniforms within the school premises has hit a deadlock. The matter will be going back to court. The parties had told the court at the last sitting that they had begun the process to settle the matter amicably out of court. Justice Ladiran Akintola told the parties to bring the settlement report to court on the next adjourned date, Friday. Earlier in the matter, the court had agreed that other parties which include traditional worshippers, other interested students and alumni association should join the suit as interested parties after the claimants raised no objection to their application. But at the resumed hearing of the case on Friday, rather than give a report of the expected settlement, parties informed the court that deliberations to resolve the matter amicably failed. Counsel to the first four respondents, Dr. Babatunde Ajibade, told the court that none of the parties in the case was ready to shift ground on the matter. He told the court that all efforts to resolve the issue amicably failed. Counsel to the applicants, Hassan Fajimite, told the court that as a result of the failed attempts to settle out of court, he had amended his charges to reflect those who signified to be joined in the suit. He pleaded for more time to perfect the processes. While ruling on the submission, Justice Akintola noted there was no need for anybody to be rigid on the issue, adding that Islam or Christianity is not the native religion of anybody. He warned all parties in the case not to allow their agitation to cause discord in the school. He gave the parties 14 days to perfect their processes and admonished them to put in more efforts to try and find amicable resolution to the crisis within 21 days. He adjourned the case to May 14 for further hearing.
