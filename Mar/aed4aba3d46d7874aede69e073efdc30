Former Nigeria international Garba Lawal has urged newly invited Super Eagles players Paul Onuachu, Valentine Ozomwafor and Ikouwem Udo to seize their opportunities. The trio was named in the 23-man squad for the Super Eaglesâ€™ Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers game against Seychelles and friendly tie with Egypt scheduled for March 22 and 26 respectively. Onuachu has been a consistent performer for Midtjylland scoring 10 goals last season to help Wolves claim the Danish SuperLiga title. This season, the 24-year-old has racked up 16 goals in all competitions, including 14 in the league which ranks him as the third joint highest scorer in the division. For Ozomwafor, he was part of the Nigeria U20 squad that finished fourth in the recently concluded Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations helping Nigeria to secure a ticket to the World Cup. While Udo has been impressive for Enyimba since breaking into the first team and won the 2018 NFF Young Player of the Year. And the 44-year-old has urged the newly invited players to grab their chances and avoid pressure when called upon to play.
