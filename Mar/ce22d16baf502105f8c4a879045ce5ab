The Lagos State Building Control Agency ( LASBCA ) General Manager, Lekan Shodeinde on Monday debunked stories of a fresh building collapse in the state. He said the rumoured collapse of a building on Egerton Street, Oke-Arin Lagos Island was untrue. Shodeinde explained a three-floor structure was marked as distressed and undergoing demolition as at press time. He added that the demolition of the distressed building became necessary to avert another disaster. According to him, the administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode will leave no stone unturned to sanitise the building construction industry by removing all distressed, illegal structures and buildings prone to collapse as well as those that were not in conformity with the state building laws. Sidewinder appealed to Lagosians to cooperate with government by moving out of all buildings marked as distressed and also stay away from demolition sites. He re-emphasised that only LASBCA has the responsibility and professional expertise to determine whether a building is distressed or prone to collapse, adding his Agency is passionately committed to pulling down all the distressed buildings in the state. In continuation of the demolition exercise which started last Friday, four buildings were demolished by LABSCA on Monday. The buildings are located on 2, Olushi street; 3, Obadina street; 30A, Isale Agbede street and 36, Isale Agbede street, all on Lagos Island. This brings the number of demolished buildings on the Lagos island since last Friday to 17 out of the over 150 earmarked for demolition in the area.
