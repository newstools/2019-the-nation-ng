Governorship candidate of the AAC Biokpomabo Awara had alleged Wike paid N200m to Yeeh, who resigned and joined the PDP on Monday. Wike, who spoke through the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Emma Okah, described the N200 million allegation as untrue. Okah said: “The allegation that Govermor Wike gave AAC’s deputy governorship candidate (Yeeh) N200 million is not correct, it is untrue and it is absolute nonsense. “Chief Yeeh is a respected elder from Ogoni Kingdom and his action by removing himself from being used to destabilise Rivers State and cause pain to the people is commendable. “Everything is not about money, as there are lots of good people around. “We should commend him (Yeeh) for taking the bold and historic step, instead of calling him names. “Future generations of our people will remember the moral lesson of his present actions.”
