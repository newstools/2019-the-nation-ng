Brendan Rodgers suffered disappointment on his Premier League return as his first game in charge of Leicester ended in a 2-1 defeat at Watford after Andre Gray’s injury-time winner. Rodgers is back in England’s top flight for the first time since October 2015 when he was sacked at Liverpool following his appointment as Claude Puel’s replacement earlier this week. And it looked like being a respectable start to his Foxes reign as Jamie Vardy’s 10th goal of the season cancelled out Troy Deeney’s early header. But the game ended in the same way as it started as Gray struck in the closing moments to inflict an opening defeat on Rodgers and deliver a fourth win from five for the Hornets. Rodgers, who opted to leave Celtic despite going for a treble treble, could not have envisaged a worse start to his tenure as his new side fell behind inside five minutes. They were lucky not to go behind in the second minute as Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel blocked Deeney’s effort and then Wes Morgan brilliantly blocked Gerard Deulofeu from the rebound. But it was only a temporary reprieve as Deeney headed home Deulofeu’s free-kick from close range for the Watford striker’s eighth of the season.
