The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Niger state has suspended the state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Barrister Amina Musa Gua’ar for alleged anti-party activities. The Paikoro local government APC local working committee accused the Commissioner of engaging in anti party activities during the general elections in the council and flaunting the orders of the party. The Party accused her of engaging in some anti party activities of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Mr Ishaya Azalolo who claimed to have acted based on Barrister Amina Gua’ar opinion, directive and support. The Party also accused her of mudslinging the party as she was said to have referred to the executive organ of the party as “bunch of thieves”. The local working committee stated that it invited the Commissioner for interaction but she refused to appear before the committee which resulted in her suspension. The suspended letter dated Friday 22nd March, 2019 and signed by the local government APC chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Kwanaread, “In reference to a letter dated 18th March, 2019, the local government executive working committee of the APC in Paikoro has resolved to utilize Article 21, Section A, Subsection 111 of the Constitution as amended “disobedience or negligence in carrying out lawful directive of the party. “Continuing, this is due to your refusal/disobedient to abide by the party’s directive within the stipulated time frame.
