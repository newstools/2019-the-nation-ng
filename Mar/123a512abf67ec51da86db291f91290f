THOSE who think that President Muhammadu Buhari, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the only winner in the just concluded presidential election missed the point. One or two other candidates can boast of victory in the election in their own ways. For instance, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, may have lost the ballot, but he recorded two great victories in the sense that he and his erstwhile sworn enemy and former boss, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, are now the best of friends on account of the election and he was able to visit the United States of America after more than a decade of trying in vain to do so. In Lagos, the candidate of Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), Fela Durotoye, was wildly celebrated by the congregation at the House on the Rock Church where he had gone to worship the Sunday before the election in which he polled a paltry 16,799 votes. Buhari polled more than 15 million votes and Atiku, the runner-up, polled more than 11 million. The church had barely settled down for service when the presiding pastor, Paul Adefarasin, who is never an admirer of Buhari, and like many pentecostal preachers wanted him to lose, noticed the presence of Durotoye. He drew the congregation’s attention to the candidate and commended him for his courage and for running a brilliant campaign. You are a candidate of the future, Adefarasin, SENTRY learnt, declared. Durotoye got a thunderous applause The accolade Durotoye could not get from Nigerians, he certainly got from the pastor and the church members. But whether they voted for him six days after is a different kettle of fish because many members of the church were believed to be ‘Atikulated.’
