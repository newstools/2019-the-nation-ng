Amina Dauda, a housewife accused of killing her husband, Mohammed Matazu, a former reporter with the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Kaduna, by burning him, will know her fate on May 30. Dauda, 28, was arraigned before Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf, on May 22, 2013, on three counts bordering on culpable homicide, punishable with death. Justice Baba-Yusuf fixed the date after adoption of written addresses by Mr. Abubakar Musa, prosecuting counsel and defendant counsel Mr. Charles Yoila. Musa had urged the court to go ahead and convict the defendant, saying the five witnesses brought by the prosecution produced evidence that pointed at the defendant committing the offence. “The act of fighting, which the defendant engaged in that led to the commission of the offence, was unlawful” he said. Responding, Yoila urged the court to discharge the defendant of the allegation against her. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the prosecutor alleged that Dauda sprayed Matazu with petrol in their home at Gwarinpa, Abuja, on February 7, 2013. NAN reports that on April 8, 2014 during trial, a prosecution witness, Usman Idoko, told the court that the late journalist was taken to three hospitals before he died from injuries sustained from the fire set to him by his wife. Idoko said the deceased, also a legislative aide to Sen. Mohammed Ibrahim (PDP-Kaduna), was taken to the hospitals by neighbours, who were on the crime scene.
