Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN),  Lagos State Area Unit Sisters’, has re-emphasised the wearing of hijab by women as a commandment by Allah in the Holy Quran. This clarification was made at MSSN Sisters’ Da’wah conference in commemoration of the World Hijab Day, at Federal College of Education (Tech), Akoka, Lagos. It was themed: ‘’The rope that binds’’. The  event, graced by many adult females and teenage sisters, had sessions on the use of hijab. A workshop  treated issues of hijab in Lagos anchored on the controversy surrounding the use of hijab in public schools, despite the approval by the state government. Against this backdrop, sisters were asked to share their reasons for wearing hijab and what they could do to help in the fight against wearing hijab in public schools in the state. Guest speaker and Manager Tax, Federal Inland Revenue Services, Dr. Fauzuyah Olajide, noted that people use hijab for diverse personal reasons. “Some use it as an identity, others feel it makes them beautiful,” Olajide said. “Some (use) as obedience to people. Some naturally feel uncomfortable exposing parts of their body.  Others feel the need to cover because they have issues with certain body part, while some just want to impress people. But the only valid reason anyone  who use hijab should be because Allah commanded it and because irrespective of colour or race, hijab is a unique bond of love that binds all Muslim sisters together. Any other reason outside these would at some point wither due to certain situations that would warrant you to drop the hijab; hence, we must have the conviction that hijab is not meant for anyone else but Allah,” she said. Olajide  also talked about expectations from hijab users.
