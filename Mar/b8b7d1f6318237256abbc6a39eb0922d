With less than three weeks to the Super Eagles first competitive match of 2019, the availability of Brighton & Hove defender Leon Balogun for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier cannot be ascertained. Brighton & Hove manager Chris Hughton confirmed on Thursday that the Nigeria international will definitely miss the Premier League meeting against Huddersfield. Balogun has not been included in the Seagulls matchday 18 since February 6 due to a shoulder injury. Speaking at the pre-match press conference before the visit of The Terriers, Hughton said: ”Pascal Gross will miss the game this weekend. He felt his hamstring, the good news is it’s not as bad as we first thought, but the game comes too soon. “Leon Balogun will also still miss out.” Balogun, 30, has made only two appearances in all competitions from a possible eleven in 2019.
