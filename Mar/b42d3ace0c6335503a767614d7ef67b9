Kano state Governor Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje has expressed optimism of winning the March 23 gubernatorial rerun election in the state. Ganduje stated this while addressing a crowd of his supporters who gathered to welcome him upon his return from a one-day official visit to Abuja. He expressed delight over the peaceful conduct of last Saturday gubernatorial election in the state which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared inconclusive. He assured Kano people of his unshaken belief he would win in the 23rd March, 2019 rerun elections across some identified polling units as announced by INEC. He hailed the electorate for turning out en mass during the election, “especially for your decision to vote for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). ‘’ We saw their unflinching support for joining the long queues at their various polling units. “As you are all aware, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed the 23rd of this Month (March) for rerun election in some identified polling units in the state. “I am therefore using this medium to call on the electorate to come out en mass and vote for the ruling APC in an orderly manner,” he stated. Ganduje assured “By the grace of Allah, The Almighty, APC will emerge victorious after the rerun election. We are grateful to all. May we have peaceful conduct of this election”.
