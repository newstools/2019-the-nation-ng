Commonwealth Games gold medalists – Odunayo Adekuoroye and Blessing Oborududu will lead 14 others to the 2019 African Wrestling Championship holding in Hammamet, Tunisia. In the 16-man list released by the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), eight-time African champion Oborududu will be aiming for another record feat in Tunisia as she will be competing in the 68kg of the women’s freestyle. Adekuoroye who is ranked fourth in the world in the women’s 57kg will also be in action. Others include another Commonwealth Games gold medalist, Aminat Adeniyi who will compete in the 62kg. Other members of the women’s team are Genesis Mercy (50kg), Nweke Rosemary (53kg), Kolawole Esther (55kg), Nwoye Ifeoma (59kg), Balogun Sunmisola (65kg), Hannah Reuben (72kg) and Onyebuchi Blessing (76kg). The men’s team has Welson Ebikewenimo (57kg), Amas Daniel (65kg), Nworie Emmanuel (71kg), John Emmanuel (74kg), Agiomor Ekerekeme (79kg) and Bibo Melvin (86kg). The team will be handled by the duo of Purity Akun and Victor Kodei, while the NWF President, Daniel Igali will lead the contingent to the North African nation today. However, Igali told NationSport that team is poised to defend the title it won at the 2018 edition in Rivers State. “We are going with full female team but we cannot afford to go there with the full team of the men’s team due to lack of fund. We are the defending champion in the female event while we are also the champion in the men’s event as we topped Egypt by three points at the last edition in Port Harcourt. I am sure we can retain our title in the female team but I know it is going to be tough particularly with the host team, Tunisia because they are also in good shape for now,” Igali said. The female team is expected to compete on March 30 while the men’s team will take to the mat on March 31. The team made up of 16 wrestlers and five officials departed Nigeria yesterday aboard a Turkish Airline enroute Istanbul to Tunis.
