An Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court in Lagos yesterday remanded a 39-year-old estate agent, Ibrahim Ayinde, in prison custody for alleged N25million fraud. Ayinde was alleged to have defrauded 125 persons on the pretext of providing them with accommodation. Magistrate Mrs. O.A. Olagbende, who gave the order, said Ayinde should stay in Ikoyi prison for one week for failing to evict the tenants in the building within the time specified by the court. At the resumed proceedings yesterday, Ayinde told the court that his lawyer was absent. He said he failed to carry out the order because he got it late. At the last proceedings, Magistrate Olagbende had ordered that the defendant should evict the tenants pending the conclusion of the matter in court. The magistrate, who was not pleased with the defendant’s excuses, ordered his remand in prison custody for one week. She said the defendant should comply with the order after his release from prison. Ayinde, however, pleaded for mercy, saying he had started paying some of the complainants. He promised to finish paying them by end of May. The magistrate, however, rejected his plea for leniency, insisting that he would spend one week in Ikoyi prison. “When you return, you will go and evict the tenants living in the house as ordered by the court”, she said. Ayinde is standing trial on a 125-count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing. He denied the charge preferred against him by the Lagos State Government. Police prosecutor Mrs. Clara Olagbayi had told the court that the defendant committed the offence in Agege between May and July, 2017. She alleged that Ayinde collected N25million from 125 persons for a 14-flat apartment in Agege. Trouble started when the unsuspecting victims started bringing in their belongings after paying fully for the apartments. She said they met other persons in the apartments despite that they were given a complete set of key to the house. Magistrate Olagbende adjourned the matter till April 11.
