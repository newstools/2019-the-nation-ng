As laundry awareness is greatly increasing, more Nigerians are beginning to embrace the need to engage the services of professional cleaners for the homes, offices and clothings. A lot of people in all woks of life do not have the time, chance and all it takes to wash, iron and keep their cloths neat, so the only alternative is to employ the services of the professional cleaners. You will agree with me that the task of washing, rinsing, drying, and ironing clothes is very tedious and time consuming that the low income earners would consider buying machine for this purpose. In Nigeria, the poverty level at present and the epileptic power supply is a great discouragement to most homes that can afford a washing machine. For this reason, most people however engage the services of cleaners in the home and offices twice or thrice on the yearly bases. This is the case of general cleaning services. Methods: The clothes are ironed, folded, and packaged neatly thereafter. Note that Washing machine has capacities, but it will be determined by the amount of money you wish to invest. Machineries/equipment Number of staff needed varies from 2 to above 10, depending on the capacity of the investment. Other materials: for ironed cloths.  Profitability: It is highly lucrative. The ever growing population is an indication of large market. Rate of returns on investment is equally very high. Monetary involvement: From N250,000 to N10M and above. Note: The amount of money invested in the laundry business depends on you investment capacity and the business plan you want to execute.  chalicon@yahoo.com
