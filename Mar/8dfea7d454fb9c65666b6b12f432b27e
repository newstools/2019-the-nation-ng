A prominent chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Professor Taoheed Adedoja has defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adedoja, a one time Sports and Special Duties Minister, announced his defection in Ibadan last week, days after the PDP candidate, Mr. Seyi Makinde, defeated APC’s Adebayo Adelabu in the March 9 governorship election in the state. In a letter of resignation, addressed to the PDP national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, dated March 29, 2019 and made available to newsmen in Abuja at the weekend, Adedoja said he was quitting the PDP in the ‎”national interest”. According to him, “I am aligning with the APC at this period of Nigeria’s political dispensation to contribute my best to the needed unity of Nigeria, as dictated by my pan Nigerian experience, having built bridges of unity among various socio political groups in the country all through my life endeavours ‎both in private and public sectors. “I want to align with the Federal Government of Nigeria to contribute to the good governance the country deserves for our people and for my followers across the country”, Adedoja stated. While in PDP, Adedoja contested for the position of national chairman of the party in 2017 but lost to Prince Secondus alongside other contestants. Prof Adedoja denied any rift with the Governor-elect of Oyo State, Mr. Makinde, describing Makinde as his younger brother with whom he enjoyed cordial relationship. He maintained that he had congratulated Makinde on his victory and that he would continue to pray for him to succeed in the task of bringing dividends of democracy to the people of Oyo State, his exit from the PDP notwithstanding.
