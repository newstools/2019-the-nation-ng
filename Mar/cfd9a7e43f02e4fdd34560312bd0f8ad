The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has got approval for a N250 million grant from the Bank of Industry (BoI) to expand its entrepreneurship programme. Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the university, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said the institution would soon begin offering interest-free loans of between N1 million and N2 million to students to set up businesses before they graduate. Speaking at the university’s pre-convocation briefing, Prof Ogundipe said: “I am glad to inform you that the Bank of Industry (BoI) has just approved the sum of N250 million to support the entrepreneurship drive of the university.  The university will be giving out loans of between one and two million naira to start-ups from this fund, depending on the proposal and cost required. “Our aim is that from next year about one per cent of students would graduate with a registered business.” Ogundipe said the university had also introduced other efforts to strengthen its entrepreneurship programme including the organiSation of a design thinking programme – the second of which was sponsored by Lufthansa with N70 million and the participation of its students in the ReadySetWork (RSW)– a work readiness programme of the Lagos State government. At the event, the VC announced that the university would soon start its Business School to offer professional programmes. “The University of Lagos Business School is set to take off.  When fully functional, the school would run short executive courses and professional degree programmes with highly experienced industry personnel as facilitators,” he said.
