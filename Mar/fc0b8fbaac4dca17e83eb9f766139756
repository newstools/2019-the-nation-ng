The governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) Uche Nwosu has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withhold the declaration of the winner of the election until the constitutionally outlined provisions are fulfilled. Nwosu, who addressed journalists via a telephone chat, noted the leading candidate, Emeka Ihedioha, to be declared a winner must have met the mandatory 25 percent votes in at least two-third in the number of Local Government Areas where the election held. According to  him: “The constitution is clear that for a candidate to be declared a winner he must have the mandatory 25 per cent spread in at least two-thirds of the number of local government areas in the state. “In this instance, the candidate of DP did not meet this requirement as he scored the mandatory spread in only 12 whereas it should be 18.” Nwosu also alleged widespread irregularity in the three local government areas of Aboh Mbaise, Ahiazu and Ezinihitte. He wondered why the three local government areas could return such huge numbers in an election marred by voter apathy. The AA candidate said: “This result is totally unacceptable and I am calling on INEC to declare the election inconclusive and arrange a fresh election within seven days as stipulated by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” He also frowned at the conduct of INEC officials, who he alleged colluded with the PDP candidate to inflate the figures in the three contentious local government areas.
