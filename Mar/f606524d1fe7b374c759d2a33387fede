THERE seems to be no end in sight to the trend of bank executives aspiring to high political offices, particularly governorship. The latest from the grapevine is that the Managing Director of a commercial bank well rooted in Anambra state,Â  has been primed to succeed the governor of the State, Willie Obiano. If that becomes the reality, the MD would be following in the footsteps of Obiano, who himself was an executive director in Fidelity Bank before he became the governor of Anambra State. Before him also, there had been cases of prominent bankers occupying high political offices or aspiring to them. One of them is the current governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, who until his election was an executive director in Zenith International Bank. The current governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, was also a top banker with Zenith while Femi Pedro, a former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, had previously functioned as the chief executive officer of First Atlantic Bank, later FinBank before it was acquired by FCMB. Besides, Fola Adeola, the pioneer managing director of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), was running mate to former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu, when the latter ran as the presidential candidate of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) in the 2007 elections. It would seem that bankers are getting tired of spending their entire lives counting money. And in the case of this ambitious MD, he is counting on his chummy relationship with Obiano to realise his governorship ambition. Only recently, the MD attended a public function with the governor where he donated a handsome amount, which some people quickly interpreted as investment in the governorship But the governorship election in Anambra State is still three years away and anything can happen before then. For now, the MD can only pray that his investment matures well.
