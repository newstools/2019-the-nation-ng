Some suspected cultists yesterday attacked operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) at Mile 12, injuring a police sergeant. The officer is said to be battling for his life at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja. Sergeant Damilola Adeojo, The Nation learnt, who was attacked with cutlass and broken bottles, is in LASUTH’s Emergency Ward  awaiting tests on his brain. The task force apprehended a cult leader and 12 hoodlums during the raid. Its Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said in a statement yesterday that the raid followed residents’ petitions on cult activities in the neighbourhood. The statement reads: “The enforcement operations around Mile 12 today (yesterday) was carried out to     flush out the cultists and miscreants disturbing innocent people around Mile 12. “We acted on series of ‘Save our Soul at Mile 12’ petitions submitted to our office by residents of Mile 12 and its environs. “During the attack, Sergeant Adeojo was injured with cutlasses and broken bottles. He is receiving treatment at LASUTH.” Egbeyemi vowed to end cult killings in the state, particularly around Mile 12, Bariga, Somolu and Lagos Island. The Mile 12 Market Traders Association has called for the establishment of a security outfit within the market to check street urchins. Its spokesman Femi Odusanya said fighting between street urchins and officials of the Lagos State Government at Owode and Kosofe areas often disrupted trading at the market. “The situation is sad because no fewer than  20,000 people visit  Mile 12 market daily and anytime we shut the market for just one hour, we lose about N100 million. “We appeal to the government to situate an armoured personnel vehicle and security officials around the area to forestall further incidents,” he said.
