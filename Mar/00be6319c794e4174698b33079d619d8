Government has been urged to look into traditional medicine as an option for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia. A UK-based Nigerian survivor, Anne Welsh, made this call recently while speaking to newsmen in Lagos. Welsh, 39, said while the conventional remains the most recognised way of treatment, traditional medicine also helps as she is a living testimony. “I can testify to traditional medicine. I was in intensive care in Enugu at a time and they found a traditional doctor who made medicine at that time and I got better instantly,” she said. Welsh said living with sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria is very challenging as the country’s healthcare system lacks the appropriate and basic necessity needed to manage the blood disorder. She noted that sickle cell does not only cause the patients to suffer severe pain, but is also one of the biggest contributors to mental health issues.
