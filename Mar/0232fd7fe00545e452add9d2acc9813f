Not less than 261 caterers were engaged for the scheme, who have all undergone training in food hygiene, food handling, food portion, and products management. of the 261 caterers, three are male. One of the caterers in the programme, Mr. Akugbe Monday, thanked the state and federal governments for the laudable programme, pledging to discharge his responsibility effectively. “I am grateful to the state government for ensuring that we are included in the national programme. With this, children in Edo State can now benefit from what their colleagues across the country are also enjoying,” he said. For Mrs. Faith Ken-Iza, the scheme is an opportunity to earn and make a living from providing nutritious food, assuring both the state and Federal governments that she will do her best and promise never to be found wanting. The caterers were provided with start-up kits which include coolers, plates, spoons, aprons, and crates of eggs. Edo State Programme Manager, NHGSFP, Dr. Mrs. Doris Ayanka-Imalele said the state government is complementing the federal government’s effort in the NHGSFP, noting that the programme will benefit the school children, caterers and local farmers in the state.
