 Super Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho are set to enjoy some professional pep talk from their African brother Kolo Toure after the Ivorian international joined Leicester City as Assistant Coach. The former Manchester City and Liverpool ace moved from Celtic alongside new Foxes manager Brendan Rogers.  The switch is coming just few days after Leicester City parted ways with former manager Claude Puel. Touré, won two premier league titles with Arsenal and Manchester City respectively, also won the African Cup of Nations with the Elephants in 2015 with over 100 caps for Ivory coast. The 37 year old will be bringing his wealth of experience to bear on the new job. With his retirement from international football only less than four years ago it is expected that his interactions with the two Nigerians and other players will be an instant connect as they will be on the same page. While Ndidi was a regular under former manager Puel, same cannot be said of Iheanacho who most times had to start from the bench with minimal playing time. Both players will be hoping to earn regular action as the duo of Rogers and Toure step in. The two Eagles in the pay roll of Leicester have made a combined 121 appearances for the Foxes since 2017 when they moved to King Power Stadium from Genk and Manchester City respectively.
