THE 2019 presidential and National Assembly elections have come and gone. But while many politicians are counting their losses, others are counting their gains. Among the politicians whose accounts are on the positive side of the balance sheet is a party chief whose party was said to have given hundreds of millions of naira for the presidential election initially scheduled for February 16. Upon learning on the eve of the election that it had been postponed by one week, party leaders instructed him to stay action on the disbursement of the funds. He complied. Then came the rescheduled election and time to spread the largesse, the party chief was incommunicado. All the efforts made by party chieftains to reach him physically or even on the phone, as they say, ‘proved abortive.’ The election held nonetheless, “any how, any how,” apology to our Niger Deltans. Suddenly the next day, the party chief showed up. Asked what happened, he said he had been busy working for the party and reaching out to people that mattered. But as it turned out, the result of the election showed that there was no work done by the party chief.
