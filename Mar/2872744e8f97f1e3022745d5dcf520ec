SULTRY actress Yvonne Jegede has finally come out to address her crashed marriage to actor hubby Olakunle Abounce Fawole, aka Abounce, son of late veteran actress Bukky Ajayi. There have been speculations for months that the couple was having issues, before the birth of their son. The actress also removed her husband’s name from her Instagram which fuelled the reports. However, in an interview published by Pulse, the mother of one opened up about her one year old marriage, saying she quit the marriage, three months after she got pregnant with her son. “We started having issues before the birth of Xavier,” Yvonne said. “I think I was about two to three months pregnant when the issues came. Immediately the issues came, there was never a dull moment, it just kept going up and up and it got worse and it got bad and today here we are.” She added that when the issues became irredeemable, she moved out of their matrimonial home after a mutual agreement. “Right now, we are not living together, and we are not living as husband and wife, we are not husband and wife anymore and I would say a mutual agreement to go our separate ways. It didn’t work out, it wasn’t working out.” However, the actress revealed that her marriage to Abounce was worth it for the months it lasted. She said the times they shared together as a couple were nice and sweet so she wouldn’t trample on those times. The couple got married in February last year, with report that they dated for about 10 years.
