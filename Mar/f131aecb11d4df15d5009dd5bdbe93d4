AFROFUSION artist Burna Boy has teamed up with Los Angeles production duo DJDS to release their new collaborative EP via On A Spaceship/Our Bad Habit/Atlantic Records/Loma Vista. Announcing the collabo on Instagram, Burna Boy wrote, “Messed around and did an international collaborative EP with the baddest duo @djds.” The EP, titled, Steel & Copper, blends Burna Boy’s vocals into DJDs’ eclectic production that bridges pop, trap and global sounds. It is also the latest in a number of collaborations for DJDS, who worked with The Dream, Khalid, Empress Of and more on their genre-bending 2018 album, ‘Big Wave More Fire.’ Burna Boy whose latest song, ‘Dangote’, is trending, will also be embarking on a US tour starting April 1. The tour will see him play across the country including shows in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, as well as both weekends of Coachella.
