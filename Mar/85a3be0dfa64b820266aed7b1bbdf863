A Federal High Court on Thursday dismissed suit seeking to disqualify the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Adedapo Abiodun. An argument filed by Abdulrafiu Adesina Baruwa, with the APC, Abiodun and the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC) as defendants claimed that Abiodun made false claim about his educational qualification, in the Form CF001 and the accompanying affidavit he submitted to INEC. Baruwa claimed that Abiodun limited his educational qualification to the West African Examination Council (WAEC) certificate, to avoid answering questions about his alleged non-participation in the compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme. Delivering judgment,  on Thursday, Justice Adeniyi Of the FCT High Court 15 dismissed case against the governorship candidate, says NYSC certificate is not a constitutional requirement for electoral office. The Court said that Dapo Abiodun is qualified to contest in view of Section 177 of the Constitution.
