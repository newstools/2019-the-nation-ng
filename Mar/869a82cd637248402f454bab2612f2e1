 It was a mission impossible for Gabon Saturday as they failed in their bid to stop Burundi from making appearance at the African Nations cup. The 2017 Nations cup hosts who were boosted by their international and Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put in everything they could into the match but the ticket appeared to have been sealed by Burundi before Saturday ‘s match as they held on to their second position finish behind group leaders Mali. It will be Burundi’s first time at the Nations cup and they Burundians are not leaving out anything in the celebration. Ranked 138th in the world, Burundi featuring Stoke City’s Saido Berahino thus became the third team set to make their debut at an expanded African Cup in Egypt in June and July. Madagascar and Mauritania had already booked their places. Burundi’s draw at a packed Prince Louis Rwagasore Stadium on Saturday looked more like victory but for Gabon it put paid to missing the Nations cup. After starting cautiously, Burundi led through Cedric Amissi’s goal in the 76th minute. Omar Ngando’s own-goal with eight minutes to go gave Burundi a nervous finish. Victory for Gabon would have seen them qualify instead. Burundi held on to clinch the second qualifying place in the group behind Mali and make history for a country that has been trying to reach Africa’s top tournament since 1976. And after Burundi guaranteed that they will be among those 24 nations, Berahino took to Instagram to document the celebrations in Bujumbura. Berahino shared footage from inside a vehicle as it drove slowly through a busy street full of joyous supporters. He captioned the video with the message: ‘Small but big hearts. Remember the name BURUNDI’.
