The Edo State Ministry of Infrastructure, the State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR) and a new scheme wholly funded by the state government using the World Bank template, SEEFOR Plus, have intensified road construction work across the state. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, said road construction remains a key component of Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration’s vision to open up the state to socio-economic activities. Osagie said, “we will not relent on road construction until we have a state, where driving through the streets and towns will be hassle-free. Central to this plan is the intent to open Edo State for business and bring development closer to our people.” He explained that to ensure that a considerable number of roads get the needed attention, the Obaseki-led administration set up SEEFOR Plus, which utilises World Bank templates in funding projects, to complement road construction carried out by other agencies. The governor’s aide said the state government through the Ministry of Infrastructure is also carrying out construction work on several other road projects across the state. Among the roads being constructed are several streets behind School of Health Technology on Dumez Road as well as others on Erediauwa Street, linking Upper Sokponba and Sapele roads, in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area. Construction work is progressing rapidly on streets in Ogbe Quarters, in Benin City, including the construction of drainage to evacuate flood water in the area. Work is also progressing on the 1.3kilometre Jemide-Ibizugbe-Osamwonyi road executed by the state government and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). In Edo Central Senatorial District, the Iruekpen-Ekpoma Road, Welfare Road in Ekpoma and several other roads are being constructed.
