Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) yesterday congratulated Yoruba people for peaceful conduct during the general elections. In a statement, the group said: “ARG affirms its support of the right of the people to elect whomsoever they wish as their constitutionally approved leader in a peaceful manner. ARG thank community leaders, particularly our royal fathers, for working ceaselessly to minimise conflict, while noting also the few reported violence in Oyo State, especially. We must continuously strengthen the foundation of law and order as the unique selling point of our region. “The murder of Hon. Temitope Olatoye blights our pride as a democratic people. We totally condemn it and therefore call on all designated authorities to ensure that justice is done. It added: “ARG congratulate all elected Governors and legislators for national and state legislatures for being found worthy of people’s trust and charge them to live by the mantra of “freedom for all, life more abundant”. “We enjoin them, as the custodian of people’s peaceful mandates, to entrench deeper the culture of peaceful coexistence and work collaboratively for regional integration.”
