As part of its efforts to create employment and growth opportunities for Nigerians in the oil and gas industry, the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) rejected 1,494 expatriate quota applications between 2016 and 2018. A document obtained from the Ministry of Petroleum Resources yesterday revealed that the Board approved 2,584 expatriate quota applications. The document indicated that the approval was granted after the requesting companies completed the application process and confirmed to the NCDMB that the requested positions were strictly for highly skilled positions for which Nigerians lacked the required capacities. According to the document, the Board also ensured that expatriate positions would be filled by Nigerians after a specified period during which Nigerians would have been groomed. The Board carried out biometric capture of 1,396 expatriates working in the oil and gas industry within the two-year period. The NCDMB issued 939 Nigerian Content Equipment Certificate and 116 Nigerian Content Compliance Certificate during the review period.
