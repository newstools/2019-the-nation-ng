There was palpable fear and tension within Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, yesterday, ahead of the announcement of the final winner of Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly election, The fear, according to investigation, was as a result of political clash that resulted in the death of a member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Olatoye Sugar. Military operatives were seen mounting security checkpoints at Idi-Ape and Agodi-Gate – the road leading to the Agodi Government House among others. Sporadic gunshots were heard around Iwo Road, Gbagi-Wema, Alakia-Isebo, Iyana Church and Monatan, which is believed to be the stronghold of the late politician. But nobody was seen arrested, as heavy security patrols also moved around the affected areas Olatoye was shot in the eye in Lagelu area of the state and later died at the University College Hospital (UCH). The ever-busy Alakia-Isebo, Gbagi-Wema, Iwo Road- Ife Expressway, Monatan-Iyana-Church, Iwo-road-Idi Ape road and Idi-Ape-Agodi-Gate Road were deserted as residents only peep from the frontage of their homes to watch events on the street. Residents, who have businesses which required them moving around, were seen raising their hands. Vehicles were subjected to serious search by the stern-looking military men. As at the time of filing this report, many commuters were also seen stranded and walking from and to their various destinations. Many of the transporters and commercial motorcycles that commuters talked to said they were not ready to go beyond specific areas for the fear of unknown. However, commercial motorcycle operators who were bold to convey passengers did so as exorbitant rates.
