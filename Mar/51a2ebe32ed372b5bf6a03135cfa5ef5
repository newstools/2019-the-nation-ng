The Niger Delta Peace Movement (NDPM) has alleged suspicious presence of special gunmen in uniform with resemblance of special killer squad in the six states òf the South-South geopolitical zone including Bayelsa State ahead of the Governorship and House of Assembly elections. The Secretary-General of the NDPM, Jephtah Akedi, said that the suspected killer squad could be working for the All Progressives Congress (APC) to intimidate the electorate and deliver the geopolitical zone to the party. Akedi alleged that the deadly squad comprising 130 men was in a mission to execute acts of repression against the citizens during the period. The NDPM Scribe stated further that his organisation got reports that some military officers had displayed unprofessional conducts and could be working with the suspected killer squad. He said that the NDPM was worried that the some military officers were planning to execute a special election game plan in the South-South. Akedi added that since the deployment of a particular senior military officer in the region, he had issued unlawful orders to his subordinates to compromise the election in favour of the APC. He stressed that it was important to remind the Nigerian public that some military officers played illegal roles in Bayelsa killings. Akedi called on the Chief òf Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, to check the activities of his officers on election duties to avoid tainting the service with political bias during elections. He said that it would be wrong for the Army to be dragged into the political dispute through the collusion of men in the corridors of power and senior officials of the service.
