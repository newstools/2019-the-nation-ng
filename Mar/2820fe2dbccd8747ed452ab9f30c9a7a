Still reeling from their painful UEFA Champions League elimination by Ajax Amsterdam, Real Madrid said on Wednesday that Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr had suffered ligament damage in his right shin. He has therefore been potentially ruled out of action for eight weeks. “After tests on our player Vinicius Jr, he has been diagnosed with damaged ligaments in the tibioperoneal joint. Pending evolution,” said a medical report from Real Madrid. The 18-year-old Vinicius Jr was reduced to tears when forced off in the first half of Real Madrid’s 1-4 defeat at home to Ajax on Tuesday. The defeat sealed a 3-5 aggregate defeat for the triple European champions. As ever, Real Madrid did not state how long the player would be out for, but Spanish media reports said he would be sidelined for up to two months. This means he will miss most of the remainder of the domestic La Liga campaign. Vinicius Jr, Real Madrid’s outstanding player in a roller-coaster season, is also ruled out of Brazil’s friendly matches with Panama and Czech Republic later this month. He was due to make his international debut in the two friendly matches after receiving a first call-up to the national squad. The defeat to Ajax capped a harrowing week for Real Madrid, who were knocked out of the Copa del Rey last Wednesday with defeat to FC Barcelona. They went on to suffer a 0-1 defeat to the Catalans in the league, which sent them 12 points adrift of Barca in La Liga. NAN
