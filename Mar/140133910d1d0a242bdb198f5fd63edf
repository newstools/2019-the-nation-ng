Barely two months after Edo State Polytechnic management unveiled the Prof Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary Centre for Natural Product Research (ICCNPR), it is set to begin operations with a grant to advance natural products research. The institution’s Rector, Prof Abiodun Falodun, who spoke at a news conference, assured that the centre would be open for multi-disciplinary research in natural products. He said: “The Edo State Polytechnic has proven to be a leading light in higher education in the state in just a matter of months. We have inaugurated two centres that will lead advanced research in areas that are not just germane for development, but capable of grooming hands in conducting advanced, applied research. “We have also secured very crucial partnership with local and international collaborators to drive the mandate of making this school into a world-class institution.” He continued: “The National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), for instance, is a strong partner for the Centre for Geospatial Information Science (CGIS) and Prof. Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary is working with us on natural product research.” “So, what we have done for the ICCNPR is to basically apply for grants to ensure that there is a sustainable source of funding for the research we will do at the Center. “This will ensure that this research does not suffer hiccup and also set clear research objectives and timelines. We already have the laboratory with which to work.” The ICCNPR was launched in last December as a pioneer centre for natural product research and  to groom a new crop of practical-oriented scientists and technologists to develop new drugs and other solutions.
