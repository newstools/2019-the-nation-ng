Kailani Muhammad, in a joint statement issued in Abuja on the 67th birthday of the former governor of Lagos State, said: “As a onetime Third Republic senator, a former governor of dynamic Lagos State and now a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bola Ahmed Tinubu has remarkably contributed in many ways in the nation’s political development, leaving behind positive marks in all places he served the nation. “Although he left the executive position of power as governor 12 years ago, he has remained relevant in national life.
