Organisers of the annual iREP International Documentary Film Festival have said that 70 young and upcoming filmmakers will be trained during this year’s edition, holding from March 21st to 24th. Over the years, the festival has trained over 200 filmmakers through its training and workshops, where upcoming  filmmakers gain knowledge and understanding  on the rudiments of filmmaking and the art of documentary film. For the training which is in partnership with the Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC), select participants will be taught  ‘Basics of Storytelling’ and the ‘Vision of Directing’. Tagged ‘Storylines’, the ninth edition of the festival will focus on how documentary filmmakers can use technology to tell their stories effectively. According to the organisers, “Technology is constantly redefining the impact of human experiences and challenging us to tell our story as a means of engaging the world with our identity, individuality and personal experiences. Taking place at Freedom Park, Broad Street, and Nigerian Film Corporation, Ikoyi, Lagos, the festival will also feature screening of over 30 carefully selected international films, presentations and panel discussions from highly renowned personalities like Prof. Jonathan Haynes, Prof. Niyi Coker, and Theo Lawson among others.
