Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) said it has commenced the construction of a Biafran university in Anambra state. Chief Ralph Uwazuruike-led group, otherwise called Biafran Independent Movement (BIM), said the university known as Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Standard University, is located at Anaku, Ayamelum local government area of the state. Anambra North Zonal Leader of the group, Damian Nzekwe, who made the disclosure in Onitsha during the celebration of his one year in office, said the institution has over 200 plots of land at the site. He said the group’s decision to build a university was targeted at boosting education in Biafra land. According to him: “We conceived to build this university some years back when our Leader, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike advised us on the need to bequeath Biafrans a legacy for posterity. “The edifice, when completed, will boost education in the land as our target is to have zero tolerance for illiteracy. “It may also interest you to know that this zone has embarked on construction of its secretariat and the building has gotten up to lintel level here in Anaku. “The secretariat is expected to be completed this year and we hope it will also be commissioned this year by our leader, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.” Appreciating the leadership of the body for finding him worthy to head the zone, Nzekwe promised to leave the zone better than he met it. “I commend members of the zone and people of the area for the massive support given to MASSOB-BIM and I want to say that without you people, we will not have gone this far,” he added. He urged Biafrans not to relent in their sacrifices to realise a Biafran state. Highlight of the celebration was a prayer session for the repose of souls of those who died in the struggle for a Biafran state.
