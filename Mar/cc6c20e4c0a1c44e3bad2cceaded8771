The governorship candidate of Change Nigeria Party (CNP) in Akwa Ibom,  Dr. Engr. Anietie Ukpong, has urged fellow contestants to accept Governor Udom Emmanuel’s victory in last Saturday’s governorship election. Ukpong, who felicitated with Emmanuel over his reelection, urged candidates of other parties to also congratulate the governor over his well- deserved victory at the polls. Speaking with journalists in Uyo on Wednesday, the CNP candidate said he knew the governor would be re-elected because his campaign was anchored on the #onlyGod mantra. He said Akwa Ibom people and other residents, who filed behind the governor, contributed to his victory. Ukpong appealed to his fellow contestants to team up with Governor Emmanuel to contribute to the development of  the state. According to him, such cooperation will ultimately bring solutions to the chronic lack of economic opportunities, chronic darkness, overcrowded street hawking, decrepit infrastructure, lack of electricity, and lack of state wide health insurance.  ”I challenge the governor to be very aggressive in the development of Akwa Ibom State especially the heavily marginalized communities of Ini, Itu, Oron, and Eket Local Government areas. ”I wish that the re-elected governor pushes for a legacy industrialisation effort through the construction of a behemoth industry, a petrochemical/refinery industry in Akwa Ibom State. ”With these in place, I believe it will cement the legacy of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and also Governor Udom Emmanuel’s Legacy in Akwa Ibom state,” he said. Ukpong also appealed to the Governor to task those in the Diaspora to contribute their vast experiences and expertise to the development of the state. ”The governor needs to engage and use his experiences gathered from his travels to western and Eastern countries such as the United States of America and China, to effect a transformational development of Akwa Ibom State,” he said.
