A Federal High Court in Lagos has referred a dispute involving some members of the Registered Trustees of Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) to arbitration. Justice Saliu Saidu stayed proceedings in the case, pending the conclusion of arbitration by the parties in accordance with ANCLA constitution. The judge gave the directive on February 14, after discharging an earlier ex- parte order it granted on January 9, this year. This is contrary to report that the judge had vacated restraining order on the group’s election. The directive followed an application by first defence counsel O.A Yakubu and 2nd to 20th defendants’ counsel Dada Awosika, while the plaintiffs were represented by I. J. Olabode. Justice Saidu held: “If all the plaintiff is seeking for are just interpretation of ANCLA, then there will not be any need for an interim order of this court. I hereby discharge the ex-parte order dated January 19 2019 and by virtue of Section 5 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, I stay proceedings in this case, pending the arbitral proceedings by the parties herein in accordance with the constitution of ANCLA.” In the suit, marked, FHC/L/CS/05/2019, a faction of ANLCA in Lagos led by Batuns International Global Link and Mr Babatunde Adekoya were the plaintiffs. They sued the Registered Trustees of ANLCA and 19 others, praying the court for, among other reliefs, an order stopping the defendants from conducting elections into the different offices into the Lagos chapter of the association. Other defendants in the suit are: Mac-Tonnel Nigeria Limited, Mr. Tony I. Nwabunike, Wealthy Honey Investment Limited, Mr. Kayode Farinto, Mickey Excellence Nigeria Limited, Mikhaila Babatunde and 13 others.
