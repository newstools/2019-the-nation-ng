A Lagos High Court in Igbosere Monday remanded in prison custody an ex-staff of Olab Private School, Lagos, Rukayat Amisu, following her arraignment for the death of a three-year-old girl who fell into steaming water. Justice Adedayo Akintoye made the order after Amisu pleaded “Not guilty” to a one-count charge of manslaughter. The Lagos State Government accused the defendant of committing the offence at about 10am on October 21, 2015, at Olab Private School, No. 11, Idowu Street, Lagos Island. Prosecuting Counsel Babatunde Sunmonu alleged that the defendant unlawfully killed one Aliyah Ahmed by negligently allowing her to be burnt by hot water. “The defendant negligently sat the little girl on top of a container containing hot water and the child fell inside the hot water,” he said. The court heard that the baby died afterwards. According to Sunmonu, the offence contravened Section 227 of the Criminal Law Lagos State, 2011. Following Amisu’s plea, her counsel, A. O. Ladipo, told the judge that he had filed an application for her bail. Justice Akintoye adjourned till March 11 for hearing of the bail application. The charge against Amisu reads in part: “That, you Rukayat Amisu, on October 21, 2005 at about 10am at Olab Private School at No. 11, Idowu Street, Lagos Island, unlawfully killed one Aliyah Ahmed by negligently allowing her to be burnt by hot water.”
