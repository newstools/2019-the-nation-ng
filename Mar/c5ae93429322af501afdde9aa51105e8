The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday said that it settled for Senator Ahmed Lawan as the next Senate President after wide consultations with the President and other leaders of the party. It said the choice followed consideration of all available options. The party also said the stand of the party not to share power in the National Assembly with the Peoples Democratic Party (APC) is borne out of the fact that it has a clear majority and does not need the PDP to run successful government. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, told reporters on Wednesday in Abuja that having settled for Lawan as Senate President, the party is working out an acceptable zoning formula for other positions in the Senate and House of Representatives. This, he said, includes the position of Speaker of the House. Onilu said that the party is not unaware of the fact that there are other senators interested in the position. He pointed out the party has ranking Senators from all zones of the country eminently qualified to contest the position, but only one of them can be Senate President. He said the party will not allow what happened in 2015 to replay, adding what the leadership of the 8th Senate did was treachery and not democracy. Details shortlyâ€¦
