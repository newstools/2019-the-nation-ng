A consultant, Daniel Akpan, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for alleged N2.23 million Australian visa fraud. Akpan, 34, who lives in Ikotun, Lagos, is charged with conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretence and stealing. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada said Akpan and one other at large committed the offence between November and December 2018 at 22, Modupe Ayode Street, Araromi, Iyana-Ipaja, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant obtained N2.23 million from the complainant, Mr. Osita Nnamani, with a promise to secure an Australian visa for him. Eruada said Akpan failed to procure the visa and refused to return the money. Chief Magistrate M. I. Dan-Oni admitted the defendant to N500, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. “The sureties should be employed, show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified.” The case continues on April 3.
