Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa (APC, Zamfara) has hailed the judgement of the Appeal Court, Sokoto division, which set aside the ruling of the Zamfara State High Court on the All Progressives Congress (APC), primaries tussle in the state. The Appellate court on Monday set aside the ruling by Justice Bello Shinkafi of the Zamfara State High Court on the APC Governorship, National and State Assembly primaries. In his reaction to the judgement, Marafa, a leading governorship aspirant in the state, said it has shown that “truth will always prevail over falsehood.” He said: “I have always believed that the Zamfara State High Court ruling was nothing but a black market judgement that can never stand legal scrutiny. “The Appeal Court judgement has rekindled the fact that the judiciary is the last hope of the common man. “We are all living witnesses to the fact that the APC in Zamfara was unable to conduct primaries and couldn’t reach consensus due to the attitude of Yari, but the Zamfara state High Court judge ruled against the truth. “The Appeal Court has today done justice by throwing the judgment of the Zamfara High Court to the trash bin, where it rightly belongs.” The ranking Senator, while commending the millions of his supporters for their support, cooperation and patience, urged them to discountenance the release from the Zamfara Government House, claiming that today’s judgement has no effect on their election. “The statement by the Zamfara Government House on the Appeal Court judgement is the last kick of dying pigs, not even horses. “You can’t build on nothing, APC didn’t conduct primaries, they don’t therefore have candidates in the just concluded elections,” he said.
