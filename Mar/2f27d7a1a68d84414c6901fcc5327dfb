Kano State Commissioner of Information, Malam Muhammad Garba has debunked rumours being circulated in the social media that the police have arrested a serving commissioner in the state during Saturday’s re-run elections. Garba, who spoke to reporters, also described the reported loss of life due to violence in some polling units as false. He said these negative, false and disturbing reports are nothing but propaganda of the Kwankwasiyya movement of PDP designed and perpetrated to discredit the conduct of the re-run elections in the affected areas as they sense clear defeat. He said the elections were conducted peacefully and smoothly adding that there was and will not be any infringement of law or wrong doing from the government as alleged by the PDP. Garba therefore called on Kano citizens to disregard these fake news and propaganda and remain calm as collation of results continue.
