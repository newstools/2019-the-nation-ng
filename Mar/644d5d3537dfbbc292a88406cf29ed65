The Chairperson, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA), Mrs. Funmi Falana, has asked the Chief Registrar of the High Court of Lagos State to conduct an inquest into the cause of the collapse of a four-storey building, which occurred at Massey Street, Ita-Faji, Lagos. About 18 persons died and 41 injured in the incident, which occurred at about 10:20am on March 13. The third floor housed Oben Private Nursery and Primary School. Many pupils were trapped. Mrs. Falana, in her letter addressed to the Chief Registrar yesterday, urged her to use the platform of the inquest to make recommendations pursuant to Section 15 of the Lagos State Coroner Law 2007. “The law provides that an inquest shall hold whenever a coroner is informed that the death of a person within his coroner district was as a result of death “in a violent, unnatural or suspicious situation”, she said. “In view of the high rate of occurrence of this building collapse, especially on Lagos Island, it will be appreciated if the inquest is conducted without delay and report made public to forestall such ugly recurrence,” she said.
