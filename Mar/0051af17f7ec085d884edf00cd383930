He added the friendly match was important to the team being the last FIFA window before the Nations Cup holding in Egypt. According to him: “We play always to win. We try to do our best.For us it is an important because Nigeria is a very tough team. It is important because it is our last match before the tournament for our young players.” He said testing the young Egyptian team away against Nigeria will help toughen them.

Sanjvan regretted the Egyptian team could not get the three points in their last group game against the Menas of Niger Republic, stressing that team improvement was uppermost as the young players learn.
