The coalition of 18 Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) national and international observers has called on INEC to collaborate with the police to investigate electoral offenders and apply measures to sanction any person of group of persons found culpable. The leader of the group, Dr. Ibrahim Baba of Center for Intervention who spoke on behalf of others, on Monday in Kano, noted any person or group of persons found to be involved in such electoral offences should be punished to serve as deterrence to others. Baba added that following reports of election-related violence and intimidation, the overall political climate in the state during the rerun election remained peaceful and conducive for the conduct of democratic elections. According to him: “The collaborative relationship between INEC and Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCS), contributed to the generally peaceful atmosphere in the state. “We give kudos to the security agencies for maintaining the highest level of professionalism before, during and after the conduct of the supplementary election.” The group called on the winners and losers to respect the rule of law and caution their supporters to remain peaceful and law abiding. They called on politicians to refrain from disseminating false information and channel their electoral complaints and grievances through established legal processes.
