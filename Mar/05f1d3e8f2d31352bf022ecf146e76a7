Residents of Alafia Estate in Oke Ira, Ogba area of Lagos have cried out over the outrageous bills they have been getting from the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IE) in recent months. The Vice Chairman, Alafia Estate Landlords’ Association, Pastor Gabriel Adeleke, said the development had forced the association to engage IE in negotiations aimed at finding a lasting solution to the problem. He said the disagreement between the residents and the company would not have arisen in the first place, if the request for prepaid meters was not frustrated by the electricity firm. Said he: “Prepaid meter would have put an end to the problem of estimated bills in the area, but IE has made it difficult for us by coming up with outrageous demands. “When we had a meeting with the National Electricity Regulation Commission officials from Abuja, we’re told that prepaid meters were free, since it has been funded by the Federal Government. “However, IE asked us to pay N25,000 for a single phase meter and N30,000 for a three-phase meter. They claimed it was for instalment fees, but we became suspicious when the fees were increased to N100,000, hence our meeting with the regulatory authorities where the truth was revealed.”
