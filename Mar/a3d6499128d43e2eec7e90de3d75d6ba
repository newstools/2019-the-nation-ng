The All Progressives Congress (APC) Thursday bounced back into contention for the Governorship election in Enugu state. The party’s gubernatorial campaign had been jeopardized as a result of judicial process which denied the standard bearer,  his ticket. A governorship aspirant in a faction of the party, George Ogara had succeeded in an Abuja High Court in upstaging Ayogu as the candidate. But the Appeal Court Thursday quashed the Abuja High Court and reinstated Ayogu. Thousands of enthusiastic supporters on Thursday received Ayogu at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport with pomp and pageantry. Ayogu told reporters that he was back and would definitely win the election on Saturday. He said the judgment that led to the removal of his name suppose not to be adding that it was politically manipulated. “But come May 29, 2019 your brother who is talking to you now will be sworn in as the governor of Enugu state. “They cannot stop it. The will be swept by a tsunami which they can’t explain where it come from,” said Eze. He thanked his numerous supporters for exercising patience while the judicial process was on. The chairman of the party in the state, Dr Ben Nwoye in his contribution, called for the postponement of the election in Enugu state to allow their candidate campaign for some time. He said the party is insisting that the Independent National Electoral Commission to immediately relist the name of Ayogu Eze as their standard bearer. The party chairman led thousands of party supporters to throng the INEC office in protest to that effect.
