The Internally Generated Revenue of the 18 local government areas of Edo State has hit N210m monthly. Before the coming of Governor Godwin Obaseki, the 18 local government area could barely raise N30m monthly. State Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Hon Jimoh Ijegbai, who disclosed this in a chat with newsmen said the introduction of e-ticketing helped to boost revenue of the local councils. Ijegbai said plans were on to block leakages in the council’s revenue through the introduction of scratch cards. He said the scratch cards were already being test run in Ikpoba-Okha, Egor and Oredo local government areas. According to him, “If you look across the 18 local government areas. You will see massive infrastructural development. For the first time, Esan South East now have a transport line. They never had it before and their salaries are now regular. “In December, Mr. Governor approved 50 percent of their savings for grading of rural roads. We have completed work on 20 primary health centres we used as pilot scheme. We want to use technology to drive our primary health. We now have Primary Health Care Development Agency. That will enable access whatever is due to Edo from the National level. “Before Obaseki came in, the 18 local governments IGR was about N30m monthly but it is now oscillating between N190m to N210m. By the time we leverage on all other sources, it will improve more than. We will now be using scratch cards to block minor leakages we are seeing.”
