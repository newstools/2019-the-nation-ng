Ahead of their inauguration as members of the ninth national assembly, elected members for the house of representatives from Oke Ogun zone of Oyo State have said they will work together in unity in the interest of the entire zone. The three lawmakers who represent ten out of the 33 local governments of the state said they had realised that lack of unity of past lawmakers in the region had been responsible for the low level of progress facilitated to the region. The lawmakers included re-elected Hon Jide Olatunbosun (Saki East/Saki West/Atisbo federal constituency), and newly elected members: Hon Shina Peller (Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola /Iwajowa federal constituency) and Hon Olumide Ojerinde (Irepo/Olorunsogo/Orelope federal constituency). The lawmakers spoke during a press conference which was held at the Saki West Local Government Secretariat, Saki, to thank the people of the zone for the support that resulted in the victory of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, winning all the three house of representativesâ€™ seats and Oyo North senatorial district seats for the zone. Olatunbosun said some of his efforts that had yielded results in the area included the facilitation of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria office to the region, among others, noting that much more would be achieved with better collaboration of the lawmakers.
