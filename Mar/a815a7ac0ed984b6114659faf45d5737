Candidate of the All Progressives Congress for Ikpoba-Okha/Egor Federal Constituency, Hon Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma, has filed a 142-page petition before the Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal over the outcome of the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly election. The People’s Democratic Party candidate, Jude Ise-Idehen, was declared winner of the election. In the petition, Hon Agbonyinma urged the tribunal to declare him winner of the election. Speaking to newsmen on Friday night after presenting his petition, Hon Agbonyinma said he wants to reclaim his mandate ‘that was stolen by some dubious  characters in INEC in collaboration with of some PDP leaders and security men and women.’ Hon Agbonyinma who insisted that he won the election said some INEC officials collaborated with some PDP leaders to perpetuate fraud by manipulating the electoral process. According to him, “I have always said the APC won the Presidential election for Mr. President and I won the election for Egor/Ikpoba-Okha Constituency which I contested for. “I had valid ground to file this petition. Nobody can steal the mandate of the people that came out to vote for me and go free. Miracle happened during my time. For someone to call me thinking he is talking to PDP Chairman to redeem the balance after he has done everything fraudulently to derail the wheel of progress. I am happy that those who perpetrated this fraud have been arrested. They have confessed and the law will take its course. “I won the election and we are reclaiming our mandate back. We will go through the the legal process to get our mandate. I am the winner and my mandate will be given back to me.
