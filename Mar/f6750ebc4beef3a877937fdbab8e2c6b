 Cristiano Ronaldo has once again added to his ever-growing collection of luxury supercars. The Juventus talisman is quite partial to fast motors, and took to social media this week to show off his latest acquisition; a stunning £330,000 Rolls-Royce Ghost. Ronaldo stood beside the pristine white supercar for a picture, which he shared with his 156 million online followers along with the caption: ‘job done. Being one of the world’s best-paid athletes certainly has its perks, with Ronaldo’s stable of luxury vehicles boasting the likes of Bugattis, Lamborghinis and the occasional Ferrari. The 34-year-old’s debut season in Italian football is continuing to unfold at lightning pace, reaching new heights as each week passes. Ronaldo currently leads the way in the goalscoring charts with 19 Serie A strikes to his name – one better than AC Milan’s recent signing Krzysztof Piatek. Juve also top the division by an incredible 13 points after 25 games played – and are yet to lose a single league game all season. They travel to Naples on Sunday where a victory could all but wrap up the title race. Napoli currently sit in second place, but potential defeat and a 16-point deficit at this stage in the season would be almost impossible to overturn. On the European front, however, things aren’t quite as a rosy, with Juve facing elimination in the last 16 stage at the hands of Atletico Madrid. The two sides are set to meet on March 12 in Turin, with Juve required to overturn a 2-0 deficit from the first leg.
