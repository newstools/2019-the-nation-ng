COMING after the launch of her book Boss UP in 2018, Nollywood actress turned writer, Chika Ike has unveiled the limited edition of a T-shirts product, inspired by her Boss UP brand. Described as a very private person, the actress, no doubt, loves to flaunt her achievements on social media. Chika, who also hosts a cultural pageant, African Diva Reality show at the launching of the book, confirmed that there is more about herself in her book. Chika Ike’s Boss UP is a 41-chapter book that covers most of the obstacles confronting people -fear, convention, love, money, self-esteem. Some are internal, existing only in our minds, and some are external, found in other people’s attitudes. As an actress, she has had leading roles in over a hundred movies. She conceived, produces, and presents the popular TV series African Diva Reality Show. She is also a real estate developer, and an entrepreneur who owns a fashion brand. She set up a foundation that helps underprivileged children access an education, and she has studied for a PLD at Harvard.
