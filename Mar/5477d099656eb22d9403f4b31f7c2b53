An accountant, Samson Adejoh, and a sales assistant, Chisom Uzor, have been arraigned at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing N2.3 million. They pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Christopher John said the defendants committed the offence at Mouka Foam Nigeria Ltd., Alagbado, Lagos, on January 1. He alleged that the fraud was discovered when the company’s books were audited. “The duo stole the money and failed to remit N2.3 million into the company’s account. “All fingers pointed at the defendants because they were in charge of the company’s accounts and sales,” the prosecutor alleged. Chief Magistrate P. E. Nwaka granted the defendants N300,000 bail with two sureties each in the like sum. The case continues on April 4.
