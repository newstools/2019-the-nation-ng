 Super Eagles Coach Gernot Rohr was a surprise visitor to Super Falcons camp on Friday, as the team continues to burn calories ahead of the FIFA women’s world cup in France. Rohr still basking in the euphoria of Super Eagles back to back victories against Seychelles and Egypt respectively rubbed minds with Super Falcons Coach Thomas Dennerby who is hoping to lead the Falcons to impressive outing in France. Falcons just back from invitational tournaments in China and Cyprus respectively are perennial contenders of the Women’s world cup since inception in 1991; unfortunately the team has always been shown the door in the group stage but broke the jinx in 1999 making it all the way to the quarterfinals. Subsequent editions however saw the team return to traditional group state exit, a scenario which Thomas Dennerby is hoping and expected to change in France.  Already the team has been pitched against Norway, South Korea and hosts France at the event billed for June. While Dennerby has the world cup challenge to contend with Rohr also has the Nation cup in Egypt challenge to worry about.  The German tactician who led Eagles to the world cup in Russia last year posting what some soccer fans in Nigeria described as unimpressive, will be hoping to put a good fight in Egypt. Ironically the former Gabon coach has tipped Egypt as hot favourites to win the title. Egypt hold the record of highest winners of the Nations cup haven clinched the title seven times.  Nigeria has won the trophy three times the latest being 2013 in Egypt under late Stephen Keshi.
