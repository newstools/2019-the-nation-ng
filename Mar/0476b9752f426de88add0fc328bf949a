The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has stated that the allegations leveled against him by the governorship candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) in Rivers, Biokpomabo Awara, are baseless and lacking in merit. Wike spoke on Monday through Rivers Commissioner for Information and Communications, Emma Okah, who doubles as the Director of Information and Communications of the Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. He told Awara that governorship position is for mature people, tested and experienced persons and not for school boys with no record of public service. Rivers governor said: “I have seen and read a copy of the press conference and our conclusion is that the entire content is as worthless as the piece of paper bearing the speech and it would be worthless to offer him (Awara) a response. “However, allegations of wrongdoing against Governor Wike and the PDP in the press conference are false, baseless and lacking in merit.” The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Rivers state, Mr. Obo Effanga, also denied the allegation by the governorship candidate of AAC that Wike bought a house for him in Maitama, Abuja to support the governor’s re-election. Effanga said through the telephone last night: “It is laughable. I do not know anything about it.” Awara also alleged that Wike induced the Rivers Administrative Secretary of INEC, Elder Etim John, with N300 million, to deploy ad hoc staff that would support PDP during the March 9 governorship and House of Assembly elections, but John’s mobile line was not available as at press time, for his reaction.
