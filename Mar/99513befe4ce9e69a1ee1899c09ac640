An election monitoring group, Youths for Credible Elections, has called on the chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, and security agencies to probe activities of Prof. James Ihemeje, an INEC’s Presidential and NASS Elections Returning Officer. The group, in a statement made available to The Nation, made particular reference to a trending video on the internet which shows where Prof Ihemeje of Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, who was the Presidential/NASS Returning Officer for Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State, was being questioned on why he appeared alone at the collation centre with the alleged local government results as against the laid down electoral procedure that he should be accompanied by the local government electoral officer and security operatives. The group alleged that the said INEC official did not follow the procedure but rather surfaced alone at the collation center. In a press release signed by the group’s coordinator and secretary Comrade Akuagba Ezerendu and Comrade Uche Ndudim respectively, the group urged INEC chairman and security operatives to probe the activities of Prof James Ihemeje on the said day and to also look into the result he presented as it can attest to what it described as “the enormous electoral frauds perpetuated against mostly President Muhammadu Buhari in the Southeast zone, greatly facilitated by INEC ad hoc staffs.” The group recalled that it was the same Ikwuano Local Government Area that had a known issue regarding some INEC electoral officers who were arrested by the police while trying to smuggle out alleged unclaimed voters cards in their thousands.
