Asisat Oshoala did a special goal dance after she scored her fourth goal for FC Barcelona Ladies on Wednesday night after she opened the scoring in the 18th minute as the Spanish club raced to a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad. The Super Falcons’ star is making the most of her loan spell from her Chinese club. After her impressive outing at the Cyprus Women’s Cup where she scored twice to help the Super Falcons finish sixth, the three-time African Player of the Year was given her third league start by the Spanish giants. She, however, did not disappoint as she put the Catalonia Girls in front after just 18 minutes when her fierce shot from outside the box flew past the goalkeeper to register a 1-0 lead. The visitors then drew level nine minutes later via the boots of Nahikari Garcia before Atlanta Bonmati and Marta Torrejon scored twice in the space of two minutes to give FC Barcelona a 3-1 half time lead. Anderson Alves then completed the scoring fourteen minutes from time before Oshoala was withdrawn in the closing stages of the game. The win keeps Barcelona in the second position with 60 points, three behind Atletico Madrid which has played a game less. After a below-par outing at the 2018 AWCON in Ghana, Oshoala has rediscovered her shooting boots and her goals are now expected to propel the Falcons at the Women’s World Cup in France in June.
