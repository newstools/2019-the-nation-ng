The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) on Tuesday rescued two accident victims on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway. They were reportedly trapped under two vehicles that collided at Cele bus stop. An over-speeding diesel-laden tanker rammed into a stationary trailer at the bus stop. LASEMA General Manager Adesina Tiamiyu told The Nation yesterday that the accident was avoidable. He said: “Motorists should always ensure that they drive within the approved speed limit, obey road signs and be vigilant. They should watch out for obstruction and activities of other road users, to avoid crash. “That accident was avoidable. It was caused by overspeeding by the driver of the articulated gas truck, which rammed into another stationary containarised truck. “When we received distress call, we activated our emergency response team and moved to the scene. “Preliminary investigation showed that the driver of the gas truck lost control while on high speed and rammed into a containerised truck parked by the roadside. “Nobody died, but three persons were injured. One of the victims was taken to an unknown hospital before the arrival of the LASEMA Response Unit (LRU). The other two, who were trapped, were rescued with the aid of the agency’s extrication equipment. “They were thereafter attended to by the agency’s paramedic and Lagos State Ambilance Service (LASAMBUS) before being moved to the Trauma Centre for further treatment. The articulated trucks were recovered to restore normalcy and free vehicular movement at the axis. “The police and other security agents will carry out further investigations to ascertain the cause of the accident.”
