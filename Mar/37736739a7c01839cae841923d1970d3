Four communities in Plaza area of Akure, Ondo State capital have been relieved of four-year power outage by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The governor ordered immediate installation of a new 300kVA transformer substation for the communities. He directed the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Utilities, Tunji Light Ariyomo, an engineer, to ensure that a new transformer was provided for the communities after the necessary engineering assessment. The transformer which was initially planned to be delivered on Monday arrived on Sunday to the delight of residents in the communities. Ariyomo who handed over the transformer to the community leaders explained to them that Akeredolu directed his office to provide the transformer. He told residents that Akeredolu was aware that there are serious issues in Ondo South senatorial district on the issue of electricity but the governor could not believe there was any community in total darkness in Akure, the state capital. The Special Adviser, therefore, ordered that the power problems should be fixed immediately. Ariyomo said a power substation would be built for the four communities and connected to the power line at Plaza, hence the new transformer. While appreciating the governor for the speed at which the problem was fixed, the Chairman of the communities Association, Goke Adurota said the BEDC officials had disappointed them severally after the residents had spent so much on fixing the power problem. He, however, assured the governor that the residents would pay back by their ballots on Saturday when the House of Assembly election would come up. Adurota promised to mobilise the youth, women and men in the four communities to appreciate the governor with their votes for APC. One of the residents, Mrs Oluwawemimo Oluwafemi praised Akeredolu for the gesture. Beneficiary communities are Ibikunoluwa, Bada, Ifelodun and Olorunsogo.
