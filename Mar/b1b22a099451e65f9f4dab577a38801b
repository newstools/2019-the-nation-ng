Heavy gunshots by political thugs and security personnel in Isiokpo, the headquarters of Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State Saturday afternoon, led to disruption of voting for many hours, while normalcy is yet to be restored. Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, who is the leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers state and Southsouth zone, hails from Ikwerre LGA, but he is an indigene of Ubima. APC members in Rivers voted for the governorship candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Biokpomabo Awara, an engineer and a riverine man from Kula-Kalabari in Akuku-Toru LGA of the state, as well as other candidates of AAC, in view of the court orders, which prevented Pastor Tonye Cole and other APCâ€™s candidates from vying in the elections.
