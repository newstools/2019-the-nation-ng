To reward excellence, the Adeyemi College of Education (ACE), Ondo, has absorbed 17 candidates of its fellowship programme into its workforce temporarily. The graduate fellowship programme was introduced in 2017, whereby brilliant graduates of the college are retained under the Teaching Assistantship scheme. The scheme provides for the engagement of the best graduating student in each department with a minimum of 4.00 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for a period of two years. Speaking with reporters in Ondo, its Provost, Dr. Samuel Akintunde, said the scheme was one of the programmes initiated to discourage students from engaging in vices capable of truncating their studentship and to encourage them to be dedicated to their studies to reap the reward of excellence. He said fewer than 18 of them were involved in the “teaching fellowship scheme” by which one of them later got internship in Turkey. “The teaching fellowship is not a full employment as the stipend paid is paltry. It is meant to give the beneficiary opportunity to start a Master’s degree programme and have experience of teaching as assistant lecturer for two years to boost their prospect for jobs as lecturers anywhere in the world. “It is expected that those who are able to find alternative employment amongst the teaching fellows before the expiration of the two years are free to move ahead in their career. Participation in the scheme does not translate to automatic employment for the beneficiary”.
