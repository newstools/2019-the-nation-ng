To test the physical fitness of its personnel, the Naval Training Command (NAVTRAC) at the weekend embarked on a compulsory 10km route march across the 11 units and schools under it. In Lagos, the march saw the assembly of over a thousand officers and ratings marching from the command’s headquarters in Apapa to the National Stadium and back. All dressed in their camouflage and boots, the personnel who were not bearing arms, however, had armed squadrons marching confront and behind them in case of any eventuality. Speaking to reporters after the route march, Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) NAVTRAC Rear Admiral Stanfford Enoch said it was the command’s first quarter route march for 2019, adding that it is aimed at ensuring that personnel were physically and mentally ready at all times to discharge their duties. Enoch who was represented by the command’s ashore officer Commodore Adesola Adesope said from observation during the exercise, the personnel were ready for any emergency, adding that they were fit to discharge their duties creditably. He said NAVTRAC was aware of security challenges facing the country and would ensure training is tailored to address these problems in line with the directives of the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas.
