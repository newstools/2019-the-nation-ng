Samsung Heavy Industries Nigeria (SHIN), yesterday, said it has been tough driving awareness about Health, Safety and Envronment (HSE) among its workforce in the country. Despite this challenge, it said it achieved 1,000 injury free days in its fabrication and integration yard in Lagos. The firm, in a statement, said the development was borne out of the need to continually promote the health and safety of its workers. Its Senior Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), Bala Adjuya said the achievement has demonstrated the resolve of the firm to guarantee the safety of its past, present and future workers. Adjuya said: “The main challenge for Samsung is that we have many employees who have never worked in the industry before. So it is hard to instill an awareness of health and safety. But once you train them, it becomes a skill for life. “The feat begins from the day that new people come into the yard. We first take people to HSE training even if they only come onto the site for a job interview. It makes me proud that during the massive Egina FPSO Project,  we were able to pull through with no sanction from regulators.”
