The Supreme Court in Abuja on Friday upheld the Court of Appeal judgment declaring Donald Duke, as the Social Democratic Party’s (SDP) presidential candidate. The judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court presided over by Justices Ejembi Eko, Kudirat Kekere, Amiru Sanusi, Paul Galumje and Uwani Aji. The court also awarded N3 million in favour of Duke. The appellate court in January reinstated Duke as the SDP presidential flag bearer after overturning the ruling of the FCT High Court that disqualified him as the party’s flag bearer. During the party’s primary held on Oct. 6, 2018 Duke had polled 812 votes to defeat his rival, Prof, Jerry Gana who polled 611. However, Gana was dissatisfied with the result had approached an FCT High Court seeking to disqualify Duke as the party’s presidential candidate. An FCT High Court had on Dec.14, 2018 declared Gana the winner of the party’s presidential primary and Duke had appealed the ruling and won.
