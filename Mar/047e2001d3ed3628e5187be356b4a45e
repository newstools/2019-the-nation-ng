Winner of the Warri federal constituency seat in the just concluded National Assembly elections, Chief Thomas Ereyitomi says he is out to tackle poverty and communal conflicts across the area. The director-general of Chief Thomas Ereyitomi Constituency Office, Chief Robinson Ariyo, disclosed this during a press briefing on Friday, in Warri. Unveiling its cardinal plans for the next four years, which include economic development, capacity building, peace building and research and advocacy, the DG pointed out they are in tandem with the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), as well as the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC) master plan. He explained the high poverty rate, conflicts in communities among others, informed the four themes. Noting that the office may not be able to succeed in everything it hopes to deliver, the Ariyo stated that each intervention that is embarked on will be done in a way that it will be sustainable. Lamenting that economy of Warri has suffered for too long, he said: “It is one thing to promise, it is another thing to deliver on the promise. “Our people have been left behind for far too long. We need to take our proper place in the committee of oil producing communities. “If the society, Warri Federal Constituency is better today, it will be better for all of us. It is on record that Nigeria is at the top of poverty rating in the world. “In the area of peace building, most of our communities are polarized. But there is no conflict that is unresolvable. We want to make a deliberate effort to ensure that our communities live in peace.” Expressing gratitude to the people for their support throughout the elections, Chief Ariyo urged aggrieved individuals “to sheathe” swords and pursue development of the land.
