The police have arrested a man and his daughter over the death of his 10-year-old grandson in Ikorodu, Lagos. A source at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the grandfather and the boy’s mother were nabbed for allegedly disposing the body without the knowledge of the father. NAN gathered that the late Abdullah, the only child of his  parents, fell ill and died while in the mother’s custody. The woman was living in her father’s house in Ikorodu when the incident happened. “When the child was ill, they did not inform the father. When the child died, they did not inform him, rather, the grandfather told a scavenger to help dispose the body. “When the child’s father demanded to see his son, he was told that the child had died. He asked for the body, they told him that he had been buried at a cemetery. “The father reported the case to the police. When the police asked the grandfather to take the operatives to the spot of burial at the cemetery, he could not do so. “The grandfather and his daughter have a case to answer. They will be arraigned for conspiracy and indecent behaviour,” a police source told NAN. Contacted, command spokesman Bala Elkana said he was yet to be briefed.
