Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) has partnered the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to develop a new digital skill learning programme that would expose young people to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The initiative was launched at Mobile Learning Week 2019, UNESCO’s flagship education conference held at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris earlier this month. The advancement of technologies such as mobile broadband, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), automation and AI, has increased demand for a new set of skills in the job market. Ericsson and UNESCO are combining their strengths to create opportunities to scale up skill development in AI and other key digital skills for young people under the AI for youth initiative. The partners will develop and manage a repository of AI and other key digital skill training courses that will be available globally as well as build capacities of master trainers from selected countries with advanced knowledge of AI skill development.  These master trainers will also get support to mobilise AI hub centers and hackathons to train young people on developing AI applications. Heather Johnson, Vice President Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility, Ericsson, said the firm’s partnership with UNESCO would enhance the project. “This public private partnership focusing on skill development for Artificial Intelligence is an excellent example of what can be achieved when leaders work together to promote knowledge sharing and cooperation. “ Borhene Chakroun, Director of Policies and Lifelong Learning Division, UNESCO, added: “At UNESCO we think that artificial intelligence is to be put at the service of sustainable development, a whole set of new education and training programmes has to emerge to equip youth with skills required to live and work in artificial intelligence era. Our partnership with Ericsson is critical to advance this agenda”.
