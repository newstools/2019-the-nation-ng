Igbo leader and Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Livinus Okwara, has assured that President Muhammadu Buhari will still support Igbo Presidency in 2023, irrespective of  the fact that he could not win in any of the Southeast states in the just concluded Presidential election. Okwara who briefed journalists in Owerri, Thursday, noted that President Buhari’s support for the Igbo Presidency was predicated on justice and fairness and not on conditionality. According to the APC stalwart who has been in the forefront for the campaign for second term for Buhari in the Southeast, “President Buhari is a man that loves justice and will not renege on his support for the Igbo to produce the next President in 2023, being the only major tribe that has not done so”. He however called on Igbo politicians to form a common front that will transcend party and religious divides ahead 2023, while frowning on the “ignoble” role played by Ohaneze in the buildup to the general election. Okwara also called for the scrapping of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohaneze Ndigbo, for abandoning its mandate of protecting Igbo interest for partisan politics. In his words, “Ndigbo must form a strong front that will cut across party lines before 2023, we must put away our political and religious differences and choose and Igbo man that will be accepted across the country. I also support that Ohaneze Ndigbo as a group should be scrapped, it is no longer serving the purpose it has drifted into partisan politics that will not be in the interest of Ndigbo”.
