The Nasarawa State Chapter of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the result of the Governorship election over alleged fraud. The PDP Chairman in the state, Mr Francis Orugu, made the position of the party known in Lafia on Thursday. Orugu said the election was a fraud, adding that it fell short of minimum standards for the conduct of a credible election anywhere in the world. “The results were fabricated in connivance with INEC and the security agencies. “Even when our agents complained about the irregularities and cancellation of results during the collation, nobody listened to them with the view of addressing it,” the PDP Chairman added. He explained that the party was still consulting with other critical stakeholders in order to decide on the next line of action to take. He called on the supporters of the party to be law-abiding as the party would reclaim its mandate through lawful means. Prof. Abdulalahi Baba, Returning Officer for the Governorship election on Monday, March 11, declared Abdullahi Sule of All Progressives Congress (APC) as the Nasarawa State Governor-elect. The returning officer said that APC got 327, 229 votes, PDP, 184, 281 votes and All Progressives Grand Alliance, 132, 784 votes. NAN
