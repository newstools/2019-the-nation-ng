Some communities in Nembe Local Government Area, Bayelsa State have been sacked following a gas explosion that occurred in the council. It was gathered the explosion occurred from the Nembe Creek Trunk Line operated by the Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company. The incident reportedly caused panic among indigenes of seven communities of Nembe. The affected communities are Nembe creek 1,2 and 3, Jalungo, Fatuo and Kalablomi. It was gathered that the incident occurred at about 4am near Oil Well 7 on Friday. A source said the trunk line had been shut for emergency repairs following the detection of oil leakage. An indigene identified as Patrick said most residents fled the communities because of the pollution caused by the explosion. The Spokesman of the Nembe Council of Chiefs, Chief Nengi James–Eriworio, confirmed the development describing it as “massive destruction of the area with air and water heavily polluted.” James-Eriworio said: “People have deserted the area and the company has refused to respond despite series of emergency calls. “The fire is still raging. The incident is uncalled for and questionable. The people are afraid. Women and children are missing. “ He called on the oil exploration company to be mindful of welfare of indigenes. He added: “This is large scale explosion. We are calling on the Federal Government agencies to investigate and respond to salvage the people. The incident has caused air and water pollution. “We are concerned about the poor attitude of the company towards the host communities in Nembe. ‘They have abused the rights of the people. We are ready to drag the company before the National Assembly and the Presidency. “
