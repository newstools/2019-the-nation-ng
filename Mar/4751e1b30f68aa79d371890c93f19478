The police in Jalingo, Taraba state have requested amnesty for criminals. Commissioner of Police, Alkasim Sanusi, said the amnesty will make criminal elements not to sin again. Sanusi made the suggestion at a press briefing in Jalingo while parading some criminals arrested for various offences including murder, armed robbery, rape and illegal possession of fire arms. Sanusi urged Governor Darius Ishaku to look into his suggestion, as he said the development will bring to near-end the spate of criminal activities in the northeastern state. He said that the police command in Jalingo has recorded great successes in the fight against criminals in the state but the rate of criminal activities in the state was high. He urged the state government to declare amnesty for all categories of criminals so that they can voluntarily surrender their weapons, shun crime and embrace a healthier lifestyle. “The police command has recorded great success in the fight against crime in state. “We have made several arrests and have battled kidnappers,  armed robbers,  rapist, Cattle rustlers and others a lot in the last few weeks. “While we remain resolute and determined to fish out criminal elements from the state and deal decisively with them, I will urge the state governor to declare amnesty for criminals in the state so that they can hand in their weapons and change their lives. “The rate of crime in the state is not encouraging at all,” he stated. The police commissioner said three members of a kidnapping syndicate terrorising Ardo Kola axis of the state were arrested while the command recently engaged another gang of kidnappers around Takum local government area, leading to five of them escaping with gunshot wounds. Four self- confessed rapists were also paraded. They were arrested for the rape and robbery of stranded persons on transit.
