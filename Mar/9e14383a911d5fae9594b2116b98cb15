The Ibadan Zonal office, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday arraigned one Ibraheem Adesina Adeyemi on a one-count charge of stealing. The accused was brought before Hon. Justice Ladiran Akintola of the Oyo State High Court, Ring Road area of the Oyo State capital city. The charge preferred against the accused reads: “That you Ibraheem Adesina Adeyemi ‘m’ sometimes in the month of April, 2016 or thereabout, in Ibadan, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable court, with intent to defraud, did convert to your personal use the sum of N3,000,000.00 (Three Million Naira) only, property of Alhaji Kamoru Atilola, which he gave to you on trust for keep and thereby committed an offence.” The offence, according to the charge, is contrary to section 390 (9) of the Criminal Code Cap. 38, Vol.2, Laws of Oyo State, 2000. Adeyemi, however, pleaded not guilty to the offence when it was read to him. Having pleaded not guilty, the EFCC’s counsel, Sanusi Galadanchi, prayed the court to fix a date to commence the trial of the accused. But the defense counsel, Bolarinwa Lawal, moved a bail application he had earlier filed on behalf of his client, asking that he be admitted to bail. Justice Akintola granted the defendant bail in the sum of two million naira and two sureties in like sum. The sureties, he added, shall be resident within the jurisdiction of the court, and shall present their Tax Clearance Certificates for three years which will be verified by the court. The case was subsequently adjourned to April 15, 2019 for trial.
