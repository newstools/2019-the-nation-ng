President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the passage of the renowned poet, novelist and playwright, Gabriel Okara, aged 97. On behalf of the Federal Executive Council, the President extended heartfelt commiserations to the Okara family, the government and people of Bayelsa State, the literary community and all who drank from the writer’s fountain of knowledge. As a dedicated and well-published writer in all the literary genres, President Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Femi Adesina, believed Okara, who was deservedly known as the ‘‘founder of Modern African literature’’ will be fondly remembered for his immense contributions to the development of African literature, drawing on experience from his native Ijaw language. The President extolled the great story-teller whose powerful use of imagery and symbolism in his literary writings helped the world to appreciate and understand the richness, complexities and uniqueness of the African heritage and culture. President Buhari prayed Almighty God to grant the soul of the departed writer peaceful repose and comfort all who mourn.
