Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola and Oyo State governor-elect Seyi Makinde have promised that their administrations will work to ensure that the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, Oyo State, succeeds. LAUTECH is co-owned by the Osun and Oyo State governments. Oyetola and Makinde spoke when the university management visited them in their states. Governor Oyetola said his administration is proud of the high standard of education obtainable in the institution, and promised to support it to combat its challenges. The governor promised that his door would be opened at all times to the Governing Council and Management. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Michael Ologunde, appealed to the governor to empower his management to put a permanent end to incessant strikes occasioned by inadequate funding. Makinde promised to “rescue the school from the claws of death”. The governor-elect urged the Prof. Ologunde-led administration to consolidate on the university’s leadership position, saying his government was not against disciplining students and workers, provided it is done with human face. Prof. Ologunde reiterated that the school management had no hand in the suspension of the Students Union President, Mr. Abiodun Oluwaseun. According to him, proscribing the union became the last plausible option to avoid a breakdown of law and order.
