Professionals and other stakeholders in the building industry have called for the collaboration of all in the built sector. They said: “All of us and related government agencies should be involved in putting up buildings to prevent collapse in Lagos State.” They spoke yesterday at a one-day public hearing on the collapsed building at 63, Massey Street, Ita-Faji, Lagos. It was organised by the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre, Alausa, Ikeja. The seven institutes in the industry and some government agencies were represented. They include Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA); Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB); Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE); Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP); Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV); Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS) and Nigerian Institute of Surveyors (NIS). The professionals said most of the collapsed buildings  were handled by quacks, who used substandard materials, without the involvement of the government agencies. The stakeholders called for synergy professionals, the government agencies, and owners or developers, to ensure that  right things were done before, during and after construction, to end building collapse.
