Zamfara State Governor and Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Abdulaziz Yari, said yesterday that governors must cooperate with President Muhammadu Buhari because of the assistance he has given to state governments, especially in the payment of workers’ salaries. He made the remark while speaking with State House correspondents after observing the juma’at prayers with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He also advised that the next leadership of the NGF must work on the basis of the president’s agenda. According to him, the present membership of the forum under his leadership had cooperated in full with the President, who he said was magnanimous enough to provide bailouts that enabled the states to pay workers’ salaries. Asked what type of NGF leadership he would like to see emerge after him, Yari said: “I will like to see a leadership that will perform better than I did; the type that will work in tandem with the Presidency. “I appreciate my colleagues for giving me the cooperation. And within the forum, there was no break-up, and there was no crisis between the Presidency and the forum. “We worked together for our economy to grow and to support the President on his agenda to fight corruption and insecurity. “You are fully aware of what the President has done for the states; the bailouts to ensure that workers can be paid their salaries. “We are all from the states, including Mr. President himself. “I can give the governors pass mark. Mr. President has commissioned a number of projects in the states. At times, he sent representatives. “So, I hope the NGF will remain united and work in tandem with the federal government’s agenda.” he said
