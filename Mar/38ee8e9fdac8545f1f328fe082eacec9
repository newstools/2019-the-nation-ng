THE Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (task force) has washed its hands of  the death of a pupil, Adijat Shakiru, at Akoun village, Ikorodu, Lagos. The girl was allegedly shot dead by a policeman last Wednesday. In a statement yesterday, the task force chief,  Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police,  said the agency was not involved in any operation around Ikorodu that fateful day. In the statement signed by the agency’s public relations officer, Taofiq Adebayo, Egbeyemi said it was unfortunate that the false report had generated comments that portrayed the task force as irresponsible. Egbeyemi confirmed the  pupil’s death, but said she was not killed by the task force. “It is on record that the officer who killed 17-year-old Adijat Shakiru at Ikorodu, Sgt. Mudi Emmanuel, has been arrested and is undergoing orderly room investigation at the Provost Marshall Unit for professional misconduct,” he said. The command, he said,  had found that “the action fell short of the rules of engagement for the use of firearms and professional standards for police”. The officer, Egbeyemi said,  would soon be tried for alleged murder.
