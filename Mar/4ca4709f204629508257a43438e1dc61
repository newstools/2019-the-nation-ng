The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop their “unnecessary fabrications, smear campaign” and prepare to face the opposition’s legal team at the Presidential Election Tribunal. Responding to a petition by the spokesman for the President’s campaign, Mr. Festus Keyamo, the PDP said Buhari is overweighed by the burden of “illegitimacy”, following overwhelming evidence before the tribunal that he “stole” the presidential mandate. In an email exchange with our correspondent Monday night, the spokesman for the PDP, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, described the allegation as “a lame one”. Ologbondiyan described it as an attempt at blackmailing the tribunal by engaging in clear acts of subjudice. The party spokesman said the facts and issues touching on the INEC server were already within the public domain. Ologbondiyan continued: “By resorting to shadow-boxing outside the tribunal, President Buhari and the APC have shown that they have no defence to present to the court against PDP’s submission that they stole our mandate. “It is even more appalling that Festus Keyamo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and a member of Buhari’s legal team, who should know better, would engage in this act of subjudice designed to distort facts already known to Nigerians, that our presidential candidate and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, clearly won the February 23 presidential election. “Since it has become clear that President Buhari has no defence to present to the court, we counsel him to save the nation further stress by surrendering our mandate, which was freely given by majority of Nigerians to Atiku Abubakar.”
