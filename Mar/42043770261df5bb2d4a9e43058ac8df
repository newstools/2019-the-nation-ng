 An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court has dissolved a 25-year-old marriage between Bello Catherine and her husband, Sule. The marriage was dissolved on grounds of frequent fighting, regular cursing, threats to life with charms and dangerous objects. Catherine, 68, resident of No 5, Orere-Owu, Ajibade street, in Ado-Ekiti, said she had known her husband for 25 years and their union produced three children, who are all married. She said the union produced three children, Taye Bello 25, female, Kehinde, 25 and Taye Bello,19, female. She said her husband threatened to kill her and he was fond of saying that he would make her father’s house desolate by destroying it. Catherine said, he always threatened that he will use charm and waste her life. “My husband told me that he knows where I live and that he will come there to behead me with cutlass” she said. The petitioner therefore urged the court to separate them, as she does not want to have anything to do with him anymore. The President of the Court, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, ordered that since the respondent had repeatedly shunned the court and vowed never to appear, consequently, dissolved the union. Akomolede, ruled that since the respondent has behaved in such a manner that the petitioner could not reasonably be expected to continue living with him and the petitioner has shown a formal act of tiredness, hence separated both parties.
