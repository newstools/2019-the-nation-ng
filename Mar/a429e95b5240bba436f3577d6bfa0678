Officials have informed SCORENIGERIA that Taiwo Awoniyi, Kelechi Nwakali, Samuel Chukwueze, Orji Okonkwo and Kingsley Michael will hit Tunisia directly from their overseas bases for a U-23 AFCON qualifier against Libya. “The players are due to depart their bases on March 17 and arrive in Tunisia the following day,” an official told SCORENIGERIA. Awoniyi, who has previously featured for the U-23s and has been in super form at Belgian club Royal Excel Mouscron, where he has now netted seven goals in eight appearances in the league. Nwakali features for FC Porto B, Okonkwo is in the MLS on loan from Serie A club Bologna, while Chukwueze is from Villarreal. These three players featured at the 2015 U-17 FIFA World Cup in Chile, which Nigeria won for a record fifth time. Turkey-based Azubuike Okechukwu, who captained the country to win the 2015 U-23 AFCON in Senegal, will also join the team in Tunisia direct from his base.
