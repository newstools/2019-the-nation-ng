Gunmen have attacked the Divisional Police Command and office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), at Afuze, Edo State, with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). The IED at Afuze Police Command exploded, but the one at INEC office did not explode. Four police officers, including the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ojo Kosenami and an expectant policewoman, Sergeant Justina Aghomon, were shot dead. Others killed were Inspector Sado Isaac and Corporal Glory David. Sources said the gunmen burnt a police van parked at the INEC office. The incident reportedly occurred about 8pm on Tuesday when many of the officers had gone out for duty. An eyewitness, who gave his name as Mr. Godwin Ikpekhia, said:  “We heard gunshots. Nobody knew what happened until this morning. “The divisional police officer and three other officers, who were on duty, were killed inside the police station. “The hoodlums didn’t stop at that. They went to the INEC office and shot sporadically in order to attack officials on duty. “Election materials and the police van at INEC office were torched by the hoodlums.” The Secretary to the Local Government (SLG), Mr. Godwin Imoudu, described the incident as politically-motivated “since the gunmen did not steal guns or cars. He said: “The gunmen can be described as terrorists. They simultaneously attacked the police station and INEC office. “They came in groups. The IED at INEC office did not explode. They shot sporadically. One man was shot in the stomach. The act was politically-motivated because they wanted to demobilise the police before going to INEC office.” Police Commissioner Mr. Muhammed Danmallam, who visited the scene, said investigation would begin immediately. He vowed to arrest the perpetrators. “Urgent steps will be taken to curb increasing crimes in Owan area of the state,” Danmallam added.
