Awori Concerned Elders (ACE) in conjunction with Awori Welfare Association of Nigeria has urged all its adults to vote the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Saturday. At a conference in Lagos, the spokesperson of the group, Prince Adeniyi Jafojo said Sanwo- Olu was the best of all the candidates, noting that it would mobilize the indigenes to vote the candidate. He added that Awori people have been supporting APC right from inception. According to him, voting the APC was not only politically wise but would give room for the entrenchment of the party’s progressive policies. “The Awori concerned elders have reviewed the political situation in Lagos State since inception, therefore it has been considered expedient that a directive to all Aworis to vote the APC is very appropriate. “The continuation will facilitate a smooth take off of the new government and sustain the existing political landscapes,” he stated.
