The Vice Chancellor, Kola Daisi University, Ibadan, Prof. Kolade Ayorinde, has revealed why the institution is the cheapest private university in Southwest Nigeria. Ayorinde disclosed that aside charging between only N411,000 and N491,000 per session depending on courses, and payable in three instalments, the founder, Chief Kola Daisi, also approved reduction of all fees by minimum of N50,000 for all students. He said the reduction totalled N7.1m for 142 students. He said: “The founder of the institution has approved the reduction of the fees by all categories of students in the current session by at least N50,000 for all the 143 students in the institution.” Ayorinde also disclosed that no private university in the country was making profit, adding that some indigent students are currently on scholarships provided by the institution to allow them access university education. He said the institution currently has students from 19 out of 36 states of the federation, adding that the mission of the institution was to nurture graduates with high employability attributes and competencies to help transform Nigeria into global reckoning. Ayorinde noted that the university was liaising with the National Universities Commission (NUC) to seek approval for more programmes that will contribute to national development.
