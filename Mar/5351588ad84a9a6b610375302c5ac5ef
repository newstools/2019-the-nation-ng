Nothing seems to be pointing to the fact that Nigeria will be among the nations competing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games as Kenya has picked an inland city of Kurume in Fukuoka in Japan as its camp for the global sports fiesta.  In the usual late preparation for such big sporting event, Nigeria is yet to make any tangible plans for the games unlike Kenya who are already looking forward to the championship in Tokyo, Japan.  Although, majority of the Nigerian athletes are yet to pick their qualification for the Olympic Games as most of them will be competing in their various qualifiers within and outside Africa this year and early 2020.  However, the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) yesterday disclosed its camp site ahead of next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.  The NOCK acting secretary general Francis Mutuku said that a team from both NOCK and the government plans to visit the city in August this year and also host officials from the city to map out logistics.  He said NOCK’s executive will engage all its affiliates concerning the pre-Olympics camp noting that the final decision will be pegged on several issues including the adverse summer weather, culture and diet in Japan.  Maluki explained that the pre-Olympics camp will be athlete-driven and for the benefit of the nation adding that the wider consultations are meant to avoid the confusion and drama that affected the pre-Olympics camp Team Kenya held in Bedford, England ahead of the 2012 London Olympics.  “We shall have meetings with Athletics Kenya, who are the main protagonists among others since we want the process to be transparent and all inclusive,” said Maluki.
