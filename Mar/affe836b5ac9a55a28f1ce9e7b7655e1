Change Nigeria Party (CNP) says it has aligned itself with the change mantra of the All Progressives Congress(APC) especially as regards to grassroots development, education, economic empowerment, impartation of skills on youths and women. The CNP said its manifesto also tallies with APC’s thrust of providing electricity, construction of refineries, poverty alleviation, regeneration of the political space, economic rejuvenation and other people enhancing policies of the ruling party. National leader/governorship candidates of the CNP, Dr.(Engr.) Anietie Ukpong said the party is in support of the governorship aspiration of the APC candidate in Akwa Ibom, Obong Nsima Ekere. Ukpong said the CNP will support the APC to weed out the remnants of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in the state and country at large, adding that ”PDP’s 16 years could be best described as 16 locust years in Nigeria’s history”. According to him, ”What APC is doing is disintegrating Nigeria from the cobwebs of past failures and dysfunctional economic and political system which the PDP ran for 16 years. ”APC is blessed with leaders who have vision for the future prosperity of Nigerians. That is what CNP believes in. Nigeria’s prosperity lies with the youths. Ukpong advised Akwa Ibom electorates to desist from playing opposition politics, adding that supporting the party at the centre will bring enormous benefits to them. He said the CNP will work with the APC to salvage the country from her economic doldrums, and advised Nigerians to vote wisely during the Saturday governorship/House of Assembly elections.
