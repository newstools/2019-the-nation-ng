Some operators in the housing and construction industry have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to take housing, especially mass housing, serious. The experts told select reporters in Lagos that the President had not done much in reducing the housing deficit, despite his other achievements. Former Chairman, Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Markinde Ogunleye, suggested that Buhari should constitute a high-powered committee to look into the problem bedeviling the sector and fashion a road map. Admitting that the government had set up a committee on housing, Ogunleye added that it could be fused into the new one if it comes on stream. He advised that the committee should comprise professionals. Chairman, Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB), Lagos Chapter Mr Adelaja Adekanmbi,  called for a review of the Federal Government housing policy. Adekanmbi urged Buhari to remember  his campaign promise to make housing affordable, noting that his administration did not do much in the period under review in that direction. He noted that the deficit in the housing sector was worrisome, adding that the government should address the matter quickly. He said: “President Buhari should without any further delay take a drastic action in the provision of mass housing for Nigerians who are in dire need of low cost houses.’’ Former Chairman, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS),  Mr Olayinka Omotosho, urged the government to allow more private developers to be involved in the housing sector. According to him, there are thousands of houses in major cities that are not affordable to many Nigerians because the houses were built by profit-oriented private investors. He canvassed the need for the government to provide an enabling environment for private operators.
