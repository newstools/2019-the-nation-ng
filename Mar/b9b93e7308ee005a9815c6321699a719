Ogun State governorship candidate of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP) in Saturday’s election, Mr. Adewale Omoniyi, has congratulated the winner of the election Dapo Abiodun, of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adewale, in a statement he signed on Monday, said he willingly offered himself to serve the people of the state and ran issues based campaign during the electioneering. While charging Abiodun to focus on developing the state without prejudice to any part or zone, he urged the governor-elect to pay special attention to the Ogun West axis of the state, stating that the zone needs improved infrastructure. He said: “I want to congratulate Prince Dapo Abiodun and I want to let him know that the expectations are high and he has a lot to handle. “As an advice, I will encourage him to look for a better and efficient way of doing things in the state. He should look at building his policies from the perspective of data; it will make his job easier.” Adewale, who is an internationally certified data analyst, noted further that: “I wish him success and all of us should be concerned on how to move our state forward. If there is anything I can do or chip in to make him succeed, I will be glad to do that. “Let him take that courage and do something different. He should create a data-driven government and the state will be better for it. People voted for him because they believe he can take the state to the next level. “I want to him to balance development across the state, especially Ogun West because people over here are suffering. With his victory, he should be the father of all.”
Adewale urged the people of the state to cooperate with the incoming administration of the state, adding that he is satisfied with the outcome of the election.
