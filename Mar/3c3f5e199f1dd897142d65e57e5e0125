Rev. Maxwell Onyia of the Anglican Church of Ascension, Enugu has called on Christians to live exemplary lives for others to be converted to Christ and righteousness. Onyia made the call on Sunday in a homily at the church in Enugu with the theme “Witnessing and Soul Winning’’, which was contained in the book of Matthew 8:35–38. The cleric said that Christians must shun evil, greed and materialism by “being the light in everywhere they find themselves’’. He said that the light of a genuine Christian remained the Bible, most people around him or her read and these people strives much to emulate such life. “It is not enough that you know God. Or that you are a born again. You must live out the life of a genuine Christian in your daily affairs with people and you must be a true reflection of Christ,’’ he said. The cleric called on Christians to pursue peace and good neighbourliness with everyone to reflect the true nature of Christ. “Jesus Christ during His days on earth did not reject anyone, not even sinners. But through his compassion he called sinners close to repentance and reconciliation with God,’’ he added. According to him, witnessing and soul winning is the great commission Christ gave his disciplines through God’s word and Holy Spirit to save the souls of men. NAN
