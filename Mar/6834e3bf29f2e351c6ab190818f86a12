The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Adebayo Adelabu, has promised to sustain the school feeding project, if elected by on Saturday. He gave the assurance during his ongoing final campaign across the state. Adelabu, who also hailed return of many breakaway members of the party across the state, assured teachers of higher wages if he succeeds in the election. He described education as the bedrock of human and nation’s development, stressing that teachers are a major pillar of quality education delivery. The APC candidate said without teachers, he would not be who he is today, adding all great men and women owe the development of their minds to their teachers. He said he holds teachers in high esteem so much he believes that they are a class of workers whose welfare should be a priority in the society. On school feeding, Adelabu explained it is an APC project which has been helping a good number of public school pupils. He pointed out that school feeding helps children concentrate on their learning while also lessening the financial burden of many parents. Urging the electorate to cast their votes for him and APC House of Assembly candidates on Saturday, Adelabu said his party has the solution to the myriads of challenges facing the Nigerian society. He explained that Oyo State has a lot to benefit from continuity under the same party, adding his administration would build on the foundation of security and infrastructural development built by the outgoing administration. The APC candidate also welcomed back former members, commending them for returning to the house they jointly built. He promised not to discriminate against any member, saying the good ideas of everyone would help in the development of the state. Adelabu will contend with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s Seyi Makinde on Saturday as the two most prominent candidates in the election.
