Two employees of Jumia Services Ltd., Olalekan Adekoya and Ilozionwu Chukwunonso, on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court over alleged theft of the online shop’s five phones valued at N278, 000. Adekoya resides at No. 20, Pipeline Road,  Idimu, while Chukwunonso lives at No. 21, Musa Ajakaye St., Alagbado, Lagos. They are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing, but they pleaded not guilty. According to the Prosecutor, Sgt. Ishola Samuel, the defendants committed the offences with some others still at large, on Jan. 30 at No. 1 Surulere St., Off Adeniyi Jones, Ogba, Lagos. Samuel alleged that the defendants stole five different brands of phones, all valued at N278, 000, from Jumia. He said that the defendants were arrested after review of a closed-circuit television camera installed   in the company. The alleged offences violate Sections 287 (7) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 (7) stipulates a seven-year jail term for stealing from one’s employer, while Section 411 provides for two years’ imprisonment for conspiracy. The Magistrate, Mrs A. I. Abina, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Abina ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until April 11 for trial.
