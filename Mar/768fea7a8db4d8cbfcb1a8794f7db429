Sokoto State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are warming up for the Mach 23 supplementary. The rerun is taking place in 10 days from now in polling units in Sokoto, Adamawa, Bauchi, Kano, Benue and Plateau states. Not a single stakeholder in the show is spared of the pulse and momentum fast building in the affected states. It will be another test of popularity and support between the political heavy weights on the two major platforms whose governorship candidates remain the focus of voters anxiously waiting to replicate their choices in the most hottest  but dicey political battle. Parties and candidates of the two contending platforms have been forced to the drawing board with ideas and strategies to woo the confidence of electorates as meetings were kicked started simultaneously on how to deliver their parties. However, no fewer than 75,403 voters in 136 polling units across 22 local governments in Sokoto state are expected to turn out for the most challenging and difficult to make exercise on the sides of the candidates. The stake is high between PDP’s candidate, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal who already is basking on the 3,413 votes advantage against his opponent of the APC, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto. Tambuwal had 489,558 votes edge over 486,145 scored by Aliyu Sokoto which produced the narrow margin for the sitting governor ahead of his opponent. Tambuwal also while responding to questions from reporters if he would participate in the rerun if date was fixed while in court said” Our court action will not stop us from participating. We want to make sure the right thing is done based on constitutional provisions” both remarked after announcing the inconclusiveness of the exercise in readiness to participate in the rerun.
