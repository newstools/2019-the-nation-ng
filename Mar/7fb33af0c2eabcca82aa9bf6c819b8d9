A group, Asiwaju Tinubu School of Thought (ATST)has urged Yoruba indigenes to come together and support a consensus candidate ahead of 2023 general election. Such individual from Southwest region should be credible and capable of becoming the next president of the country , after the second term administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The group being coordinated by the 2016 governorship candidate of the Citizen Popular Party(CPP) in Ondo state, Peter Fasua agitated for power to shift to the South-West in 2023. Fasua spoke with reporters during the celebration of 67th birthday party, organised by the group in honor of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, held in Akure, the Ondo State at the weekend. Fssua said there was a need for the people of the South-West region to do away with ethnic or religious bigotry and support one Yoruba candidate in 2023 presidential election. According to him ” We Yoruba people should think deeply, that disunity can’t take us anywhere. If we can come together and support a consensus candidate for the election, coming in four years, the better it will be for us. ” We must come together as one, we must have one voice in presenting a credible consensus candidate, you may think four years is far but it is not, we must start preparing now. “Our group is apolitical, we do not belong to any political party neither are we spokespersons of any politician but we believe we should all go out and start working for the Yoruba interest before 2023. Fasua described Tinubu as a true son of Yoruba, who had imparted into the lives of many people, in Yoruba land and country in general, through his philanthropic gesture.
