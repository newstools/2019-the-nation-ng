Many Nigerians are skeptical of their safety at the polling units in 29 states in tomorrow’s Gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections. This is due to the many security infractions recorded in the just-concluded Presidential and National Assembly polls. The development accounted for the low voter’s turnout at the last exercise. For those who are concerned about safety, here are some security tips during the exercise tomorrow: * Ensure you go to the polling unit with the authentic PVC to avoid any form of harassment from INEC officials, security personnel and electorates. * Do not put on political campaign uniforms to the polling unit to avoid being targeted by opposition parties. *Arrive the polling unit early to cast your votes. * Do not disclose who you will vote for at the centres. * Do not argue about politics or condemn any candidate at the polling unit. * Kindly submit your phone(s) to the Presiding Officer before entering the cubicle. * Ensure no one sees your choice of candidate as you thumb print inside the cubicle. * Gently conduct yourself in an orderly manner before and after casting your vote. * Stay some distance away from the polling unit in case you intend to wait till the announcement of results. * Immediately report any suspicious movement or strange faces at the polling unit to the security personnel. * Do not engage in any form of electoral offences such as ballot stuffing or snatching that may endanger your life. * Leave the polling unit immediately if you feel unsafe or notice an imminent violence
