The Government of Delta State is proud of the recent football fest in which the state hosted three international matches within five days. Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Chiedu Ebie, told journalists that the ‘football fest’ had justified the position of Delta as the leading state in sports. Ebie said: “Our governor is passionate about sports and that is why we could do this effortlessly. It is good for the state because we have shown that we are good enough to stage international sports events. The Stephen Keshi Stadium hosted athletics last year without a problem and now three big football matches within five days. We are so proud of this. “Next week, we will also host the final of the Principals’ Cup for secondary schools, which is a developmental event. At the last two editions of the National Sports Festival, our athletes emerge overall first on the medals table and these are enough to exhibit our strength in sports.” Ebie added that it was the wish of Governor Okowa to see Delta athletes, especially footballers dominate various cadres of the national teams in the nearest future. The Super Eagles took on Seychelles at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba on March 22 and after recording a 3-1 win, the U-23 team also engaged Libya in an AFCON qualifier for that cadre on March 25.
