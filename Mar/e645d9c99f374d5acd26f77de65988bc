Following the Court of Appeal’s stay of execution order on a judgement by the Edo State High Court, which nullified the Edo State Sanitation and Pollution Management Law, the Edo Waste Management Board has re-activated the ‘Clean Up Edo’ campaign, deploying resources to clear major roads and streets in Benin City, of debris and dirt. Addressing journalists, General Manager, Edo State Waste Management Board, Mr. Osadebamwen Charles Imariagbe, said the campaign is in compliance with the directive by the Acting Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, to the State Ministry of Environment to embark on a state-wide cleanup exercise. Imariagbe noted, “After sufficient sensitisation, the state government will take it upon itself to ensure compliance among members of the public in residences and across major streets.” He said the board will also ensure effective monitoring of the activities of waste managers, noting, “We will ensure that waste managers carry out their roles, which include evacuating wastes from residences and industrial areas, as we will not tolerate non-compliance.” He urged members of the public to support the ‘Clean Up Edo’ campaign and keep their surroundings clean to safeguard public health. Recall that while reacting to the Court of Appeal’s stay of execution order, the Acting Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu gave a two-week ultimatum to the State Ministry of Environment to embark on a state-wide cleanup exercise, urging the public to cooperate with the ministry in ensuring that major roads and streets are rid of dirt and debris.
