Wales manager Ryan Giggs admitted the pressure was on his side to get their European Qualifiers campaign off to a winning start against Slovakia last night. The home team overcame Slovakia 1-0 thanks to Daniel James’s fifth-minute strike at the Cardiff City Stadium to move level on points with their opponents, and Croatia, in the Group E standings. However, with both Croatia and Slovakia having won their opening games in the section, Giggs knew Wales also needed to get all three points in the Principality. “It’s not easy,” he told Sky Sports. “I had to play it down beforehand when all the other teams have got points on the board and you do feel the pressure, and you feel that you’ve got to get off to a good start and win and that’s what we got,” Giggs told Sky Sports. “I am proud in the performances and at the end, just digging in and keeping that clean sheet.” Giggs caused a few raised eyebrows by selecting a youthful line-up in the Welsh capital, making 11 changes from Wednesday’s 1-0 friendly win over Trinidad and Tobago, but it paid off. “Especially in the first half, they showed really good composure,” Giggs added. “In the second we rode our luck a little bit. “I felt we could have scored a couple more goals [in the] first half with the right decision-making in the final third. Some of the play was fantastic, paired with a lot of grit and determination at the end.”
