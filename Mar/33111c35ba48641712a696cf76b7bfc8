MAVINS Record first lady Tiwa Savage, who is currently in London, has been taught a lesson in thrift by her mother. The mother of one and ‘One’ crooner disclosed this in a video via Twitter. In the video which Tiwa captioned “I love her soooooo much”, Tiwa is seen strolling on the streets of London with her mum who begins by saying, “just a penny.” Then Tiwa explains: “My mum said you should always take your change back when you go to the shop because its start from a penny into millions,” she said as they walked. She said her mother watched Richard Quest’s tagline of his show, Quest Means Business on CNN and it has become a sort of mantra. “She made me watch it and has been saying “just a penny” since,” said Tiwa. Many fans have been reacting and showing love to Tiwa’s mum since the video surfaced. Since the release of her song, ‘One,’ Tiwa has been less active on social media. In fact, on Instagram, she removed all the pictures, leaving only three of herself. There is also no image or video on Instagram posted in 2019.
