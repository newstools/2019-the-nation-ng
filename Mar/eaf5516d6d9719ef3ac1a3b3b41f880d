The Ijaw National Congress (INC), has warned against the militarization of the Ijaw communities as the nation gets ready for Saturday’s gubernatorial elections across the states. INC Spokesperson and former Minister of Police Affairs, Alaowei Broderick Bozimo, who spoke to journalists in Warri also appealed to the federal government to allow peace to reign in the Niger Delta region. He said, “Now rumours are flying everywhere that there would be a complete overrun of the Ijaws for the purpose of this election. We plead with Mr President, the APC to leave the Ijaw nation alone and let sleeping dogs lie.” Bozimo, who is also a leader of the Ijaw nation, reiterates the resolve of the INC to support governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta as their preferred candidate in next Saturday’s gubernatorial elections. “We the Ijaws will support the PDP in the next gubernatorial elections in Nigeria, specifically Okowa the candidate of the PDP in Delta State and all other southern areas where the Ijaws is predominant, namely Edo, Ondo, Delta, Rivera, and Cross River. “That position has been taken for a while now and was highlighted by the Ijaw National Congress Steering Committee in Port Harcourt where we took that decision. So what I am doing is to reemphasise that position. “So I want to appeal to our sons and daughters wherever they are, in disapora or in Nigeria  that we have taken a position and we want to stand with the PDP in this gubernatorial elections and even the state House of Assembly elections,” Bozimo added.
