The Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) Commission in partnership with a private company AMFEST, has initiated moves for the six states in the region to tap into the multi-billion dollar creative industry. At the presentation of reports to the Director General of the commission in Ibadan at the weekend, AMFEST Project Director, Mr Kayode Adebayo, explained that Southwest states must leverage on their locational, personnel and cultural advantage to maximize the benefits of the multi-billion Naira industry. The seven areas include film, fashion, music, food, media and entertainment. According to Adebayo, the creative industry generates several billion Naira businesses yearly, adding that it also gainfully employs thousands of people. He explained that AMFEST Expo project was aimed at bringing together and creating an economy that will outlive the current generation. He pointed out that Southwest states have assets that need to be brought together and utilized for the growth of the creative sector. Adebayo further emphasized that the industry promotes intellectual property which continues to produce income for their owners. He said: “Western states are capable of generating intellectual products or materials from the local to the international space. That is why we are advocating for the creative economy. We are creating and building a networking platform for all creative people to maximize their talents and earn maximum economic gains. Implementation of our reports by the six states in the region is needed for the potential of the industry to be fully unleashed.”
