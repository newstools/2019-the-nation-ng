The Action Alliance (AA) in Imo State has called for the arrest and prosecution of the Returning Officer of the governorship election, Prof. Francis Otunta. Otunta declared candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Emeka Ihedioha, winner of the governorship election. Director-General of AA’s campaign organisation, Chidi Ibe, who addressed a news conference yesterday, said: “Despite the fact that the PDP’s candidate, Emeka Ihedioha, did not meet the constitutional requirements, the Returning Officer declared him the governor-elect. “The governor-elect did not make the constitutional required two-third in at least 18 out of the 27 local government areas. Ihedioha’s declaration as winner of the election was a mockery of our democracy. “I call on the anti-graft agencies to investigate this returning officer who came to Imo State to undermine the law. The PDP candidate only made two-third in 12 councils while our candidate, Uche Nwosu, made two-third in 21 councils. The law is clear on this. There ought to be a rerun between the two leading candidates.”
