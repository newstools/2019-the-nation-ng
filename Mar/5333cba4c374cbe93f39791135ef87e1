The  National Park Service is to build a marine park in Bayelsa State, its Conservator-General, Alhaji Ibrahim Goni has said. Goni stated this in Abuja as the country joined the world to commemorate the World Wildlife Day, which is celebrated on March 3 yearly. It theme  was: “Life below water: For people and planet’’. He explained that marine parks were protected areas of sea, oceans, estuaries or large lakes where human activities are restricted. He observed that it’s not only human activities in the marine environment that affect life in the sea but also the things we do on land. He said the marine park will ensure that oceans and marine species are preserved and protected. Goni, however, said marine pollution remained a major problem that threatens life in the sea at all levels. According to him, the oceans  were used as dumping ground for for waste, including sewage, industrial run-off and chemicals. On pollution, he said it ranges from oil spills to pollutants from the communities which flow to the sea through flood during raining seasons. He said: “All marine pollutions have the potential to seriously damage marine habitats and life in the sea,’’ he said. He said the service was working hard to meet its targets for SDG 14 on oceans to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. He said the service was working with stakeholders to conserve wildlife across the country. According  to him there are thousands of wildlife species internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, health care, housing, tourist souvenirs, cosmetics or fashion.’ He, however, assured that with proper partnership, the survival of wildlife and their benefits for the livelihoods, health and environment would be ensured. On the way forward, he explained that he has entered into collaboration through MOU with various government and NGOs toward getting technical, financial, and scientific assistance.
