Commuters and motorists plying the Ikeja Along axis on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway have urged the Lagos State Government to intensify efforts toward decongesting  the perennial  gridlock there. Those who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the weekend said they usually spent over two hours in traffic from Ikeja GRA, inward PWD and Ikeja Along between 3pm and 7pm daily. They said traffic jam on that axis from 3pm had become perennial due to commercial vehicles’ activities at the Ikeja Along bus stop terminal. The motorists decried the lackadaisical attitude of some personnel of the state traffic agency stationed there  to ease traffic. A civil servant, Mr. Adekunke Iyanda, said the officials were not strict enough in enforcing the law, adding that the bus drivers undermined their presence by parking on the road to pick passengers. He implored the drivers to use the bus stop park lane  to avoid causing traffic jam.
