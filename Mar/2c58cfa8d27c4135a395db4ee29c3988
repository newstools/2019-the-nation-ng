A 63-year-old businesswoman, Mrs. Mabel Alli, has prayed an Igando Customary Court, Lagos to dissolve her 41-year-old marriage, accusing   her husband, Richard, of sleeping with their daughters and impregnating her sister. She alleged that he sexually molested their three daughters, describing him as a womaniser. “After impregnating my sister, he took one of our daughters to hospital to have an abortion. “My 13-year-old daughter told me that he always sneaks into her room to have sex with her. “I have caught my husband red handed on top of our third daughter. My friends and domestic workers are not exempted. I have caught him making love to them too”,  the petitioner claimed. She alleged that her husband was fetish, adding that he wanted to use her for money ritual in order to finance his political ambition. “He has taken me to herbalists in Badagry, Sango and other places for money ritual. I followed him because he said it was for goodwill. “I stopped following him to herbalists when the last herbalist he took me to asked me to come alone the following day, but I went with one of our daughters. “He told me that I should stop following my husband about and should run for my life, as he wanted to use me for ritual or make me mad, so that he could inherit my belongings, which included cars and houses. “My husband collected money from me, using charms. He spent it on his political ambition, but he lost the election,” Mrs. Alli said. She alleged that her husband does not take care of their children. “Everything rests on me. I shoulder the responsibility of feeding my family, paying school fees, among others. “I implore this court to dissolve the union. I am no longer interested in it because my husband wants to kill me,” she told the court. Richard, who denied the allegations, said he was also no longer interested in the marriage. He claimed that he was the source of his wife’s wealth. The court President, Mr. Adeniyi Koledoye, fixed May 2 for judgment.
