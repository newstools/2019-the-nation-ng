NOLLYWOOD actress, Omowunmi Dada, who is currently on set of a new project titled, ‘City Of Bastards’, says her craft is not limited to any particular kind of role. She said her role in the flick is more challenging as she will be acting as someone bred in the ghetto. Seen with a guitar, the actress who will be acting alongside big names in the industry with expectation of the movie being screened at festivals stated: “Most times, my craft is not in your looks but your ability to switch both worlds in an instant flash. I call her Majaribio but you can call her Maja! Trust me, The Story behind this woman is beyond my mind, if I tell you Instagram would block me”. ‘City Of Bastards’ which is written by Titilope Orire, has 65 crew, 50 cast and 500 extras. The flick stars the likes of Bolanle Ninolowo, Linda Osifo,  Stan Nze, Omowunmi Dada, Ayobami Alvin, Shaffy Bello, Femi Branch, Funky Mallam, Ifu Ennada, Judith Audu and Etinosa Idemudia among others.
