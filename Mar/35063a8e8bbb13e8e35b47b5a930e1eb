The governorship candidate of the ruling All Progressives Conhress (APC) in Lagos state, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, has been declared winner in polling unit 033 in VGC where Vice President Yemi Osinbajo voted today. The APC candidate polled 223 votes to defeat his main challenger, Jimi Agbaje, of the Peoples Democratic Party, who got 176 votes. Also in the state house of assembly votes, APC (193 votes) defeated the PDP (155 votes). This is a departure from the presidential and national assembly elections where the PDP won in the two polling units in VGC two weeks ago.
