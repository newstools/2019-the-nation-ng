The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has applauded the judiciary as truly, the defender of Nigeria’s democracy. Atiku Abubakar made the declaration while reacting to the verdict of the Osun governorship election petition tribunal which upheld the election of the PDP candidate in the September 22, 2018 governorship election, Senator Ademola Adeleke. In a statement yesterday by his media adviser, Mr. Paul Ibe, the former Vice President noted that the restoration of the stolen mandate of Senator Adeleke showed that indeed the judiciary is the last refuge of the common man and that in truth, those who were aggrieved and resolved to maintain the peace, have been vindicated. Atiku congratulated Senator Adeleke, the PDP and men and women of goodwill in Osun State, who he said, did not waiver in their commitment to retrieve the stolen mandate. “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy has come for the people of Osun”, Atiku added. The PDP presidential candidate commended the courage of the judiciary and its resilience even in the face of alleged strenuous effort by the All Progressives Congress (APC) -led government to undermine and intimidate it. According to him, the decision of the judiciary in the Osun governorship election was phenomenal in view of the culture of inconclusive elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in this season. “The judgment has rekindled hope and confidence that those whose mandate had been tampered with or denied can look forward to justice being done to them,” Atiku said. He urged the judiciary to remain steadfast as the eyes of all Nigerians and indeed the whole world are on them to help ensure that democracy in Nigeria is put on a solid foundation.
