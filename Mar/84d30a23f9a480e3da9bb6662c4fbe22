A 32-year-old housewife, Ruth Emehelu, was yesterday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stabbing a 15-year-old domestic worker with a knife. The police charged Emehelu with assault. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde said the defendant committed the offence in January at her home. He alleged that the defendant assaulted the girl, who was kept in her custody, with a knife, for returning home late from an errand. The prosecutor alleged that the defendant beat up the girl and injured her with a knife. Magistrate B.O. Osunsanmi granted her N50, 000 bail with one surety in the like sum. She said the surety must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on April 1.
