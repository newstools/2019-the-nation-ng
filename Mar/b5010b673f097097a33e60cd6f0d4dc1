A late effort from Anam Imoh ensured Nigeria toppled Slovakia 4-3 in their second game of the Cyprus Women’s Cup held at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium, Larnaca yesterday. Head coach, Dennerby made seven changes to the team that started against Austria last Wednesday, with Chiamaka Nnadozie replacing the suspended Tochukwu Oluehi between the sticks while Ini Umotong, Ngozi Okobi, Josephine Chukwunonye, Ngozi Ebere, Alice Ogebe and Fransisca Ordega all coming into the side. Skipper, Chikwelu put her team ahead barely eight minutes in when she pounced on a lay off by Ogebe to beat El-Dahaibiová in the opposition goal as the Super Falcons sought to take stronghold of the game. Defender Ohale soon got in on the goalscoring act, scoring from a set piece situation to double the lead with just 28 minutes on the clock. Nigeria continued to show her supremacy in the game and seven minutes before the break, Chikwelu grabbed her second of the game following some good work by Ordega who held off the opposing defence to set her up. The Europeans mounted a surprise comeback after the restart to pull level, with Jana Vojteková kick-starting the goals in the 67th minute before a brace from Lucia Haršanyová illustrated a nine-minute spell of brilliance from the Slovakians. But substitute striker, Anam Imo on for Ordega had other plans, scoring the winner eight minutes from time off an assist from another substitute, Asisat Oshoala tospare the team’s defensive blushes.
