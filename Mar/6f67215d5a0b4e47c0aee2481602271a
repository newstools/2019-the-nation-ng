The Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) has held a meeting on the British Governmentâ€™s planned exit from the European Union. The NBCC has engaged stakeholders and member partners of the commission to its quarterly advocacy group breakfast session to discuss the impact and opportunities for key stakeholders within the Nigerian and British business communities in relations to trade with the United Kingdom in the coming months. The meeting, which was organised by the commission aimed at enlightening stakeholders on preemptive steps to be taken in positioning their businesses and taking the lead with great advantages the Brexit has to offer. Delivering the keynote speech, the British Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria, Laure Beaufils stated that one major opportunities the Brexit presents to stakeholders is that, it avails the British government the independence to put in place its own trade policies as a country, alongside other countries which includes Nigeria and other business communities with affiliation with Britain. She also stated, that the increased trade relations and engagement will be beneficial for investors and trading markets as the relationships will not just be limited to commercial affairs, but through British establishments and commitments.
