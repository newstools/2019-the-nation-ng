A man suspected to be mentally unstable on Saturday  jumped to his death from a bank’s network mast in Sango area of Ibadan. Confirming the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the Oyo State Police Public Relation officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said the naked victim  came to the Wema Bank branch in Sango and entered the building  through its   small gate. Fadeyi said that the victim, having successfully entered the premises of the bank through the small gate, climbed the bank’s  mast  before the security personnel  became aware. He  said the victim, however,  jumped down  to the roof of the bank  before the police and Fire Service personnel  arrived. “The impact was so much that he crashed  through the roof and fell inside the bank. “ An official of the bank was called in to open the premises. “By the time the bank’s  door was opened,  the man was already bleeding through the mouth and was rushed to the University College Hospital where he was confirmed dead,’’ Fadeyi said. He said the corpse had been deposited at the Adeoyo Hospital for autopsy while efforts were on  to ascertain his identity.
