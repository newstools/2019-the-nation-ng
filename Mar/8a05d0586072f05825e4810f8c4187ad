Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major General Suleiman Kazaure on Sunday called on 2019 batch ‘A’ corps members currently undergoing orientation course not to indulge in any act of criminality. The NYSC DG issued the warning when he paid unscheduled visit to permanent orientation camp of the scheme in Kaduna, where 2,074 corps members are currently undergoing 21-day orientation course. According to him, as young graduates, the corps members have the potential to become great people if they shun vices capable of tarnishing their image and that of the scheme. He urged the corps members to embrace the skill acquisition and entrepreneural development (SAED) programme the scheme introduced three years ago which was developed to make Nigerian graduates self-reliant after their one year mandatory service to motherland. He said, “today, I welcome you all to the NYSC family where we train young graduates who will become great leaders tomorrow. Your future is very bright if you do not involve yourselves in any crime. No corps member should engage in 419er, internet fraud and drug. “White collar jobs are difficult to get. Over 300,000 corps members pass through the scheme every year out which only a few get employed. This is where innovation and creativity come in. “This was why the scheme has SAED programme on ground for corps members to engage with instead of roaming the street after the service. “You must respect the culture and traditions of your host communities. Avoid night crawling, dress responsibly and comport yourselves very well as ambassadors of Nigeria,” he added.
