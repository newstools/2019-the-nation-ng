Oyo State Governor-elect, Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday insisted that he would probe last-minute contracts being allegedly awarded by the outgoing administration of Governor Abiola Ajimobi. This came as he denied attacking Ajimobi after the election. In a statement by his spokesman, Prince Dotun Oyelade, Makinde said his recent comments on the fresh contracts being allegedly awarded by the state government was borne out of concern for the financial health of the state rather than an attack on the person of Governor Ajimobi. The Governor-elect said he accords Ajimobi due respect, not only as governor but as his senior. “But governance being a serious business, Makinde cannot look on while direct instructions are given to local government councils to spend all monies in their care including stabilisation accounts, which are traditionally reserved for emergencies and natural disasters even when there are no cases of emergency anywhere in the state,” Makinde said. He re-emphasised that he would reverse any fresh contract and also punish perpetrators. Ajimobi had accused Makinde of attacking him personally after winning the election instead of laying bare his administration’s blueprint for the people he intends to govern.
