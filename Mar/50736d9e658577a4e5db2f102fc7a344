 After being declared bankrupt, Boris Becker was forced to put his treasured tennis memorabilia up for sale to settle his debts.  But his perilous financial situation has failed to dent his luxurious living arrangements. The Daily Mail has established that the former Wimbledon champion has taken up residence at a £5million penthouse apartment overlooking the Thames. Spanning two floors, his three-bedroom home boasts stunning views of the London skyline and costs around £10,000 a month to rent. Becker, 51, moved out of the Wimbledon mansion he shared with his second wife Lilly, 42, following their separation last year. This week he was spotted chatting to the concierge of the new building before driving away in a £60,000 Mercedes E-class. His modern apartment block is in south London and has a tennis court, a gym, a sauna and a steam room. Before he moved in, the property was on the market for £4,900,000. The estate agent described it as a ‘superb, modern and stylish’ penthouse. Last night a resident said: ‘Becker moved in halfway through last year and he has one of the best apartments in the block. The balconies get sunshine for most of the day. It really is a fantastic place to live, but it certainly isn’t cheap.’ It is unclear how he is able to afford the overheads. He was declared bankrupt in June 2017 over a debt of £3.34million owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham and Co. It became clear he was being chased for millions more, with suggestions that he owed as much as £54million to creditors. Becker made around £100million from tennis but spent much of it on an extravagant lifestyle, buying sports cars and expensive artwork. Divorce from his first wife Barbara and a payoff to the Russian model who gave birth to his daughter after a fling in 2000 have cost him millions. Becker works as an after-dinner speaker, with a starting price of £20,000, as well as a commentator for the BBC among others.
