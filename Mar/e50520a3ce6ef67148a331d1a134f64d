About eight persons, who were allegedly involved in last Tuesdayâ€™s attack and killing of four police officers at Afuze, the headquarters of Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State, have been arrested. Gunmen had used Improved Explosive Devices (IED) to bomb the police station and set some vehicles ablaze. They took the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the station, Ojo Kosenami and three others to a room, stripped them naked before killing them. Other police officers killed were Sergeant Justina Aghomon, Inspector Sado Isaac and Corporal Glory David. Police sources told our reporter that the gunmen invaded the police station to release one of their gang members, who was arrested and detained by the late DPO. The sources said the leader of the gang offered money to the DPO for bail, but he turned it down and insisted that the case be transferred to the police headquarters for further investigation. Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy Mr. Crusoe Osagie said the feat achieved in arresting the suspects was based on the order to the Edo State Police Command by the governor to fish out the culprits. He said the suspects would be paraded today.
