The police have arrested some operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for alleged illegally arrest, torture and extortion of money. They were said to have arrested and tortured a man, Emmanuel Adegbite and extorted N434,000 from his mother. The Nation learnt yesterday that the SARS operatives stormed Royal Crown Hotel, at Asolo, Ikorodu, Lagos on Tuesday and arrested some people. It was gathered that Adegbite, who was playing snooker was among those nabbed and taken to SARS base at Ijede. The operatives allegedly tortured them for hours at gunpoint and only stopped when Adegbite’s mother transferred N434,000 into an account provided by the officers. The woman, it was alleged, also paid the operatives another N30,000 for her son’s release. The total amount they allegedly collected was N464,000. The Nation learnt that the woman made the transfer from her Access Bank account to a Pagatech account number 3756479401. This information, which was shared on a group chat, attracted condemnation, with participants demanding that the culprits be arrested and the woman’s money refunded. Confirming the operatives’ arrest, Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone II Command Lawal Shehu said the parties were expected at the zonal headquarters in Onikan today. He said: “As you said, it is an allegation. But we have already detained members of the team involved. The policemen, whose pictures were published, are in custody. Investigation is on. I am awaiting the parties to come tomorrow (today). We will get to the root of the matter.”
