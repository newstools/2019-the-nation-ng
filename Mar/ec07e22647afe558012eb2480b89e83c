In a bid to tackle child defilement and rapists in Ekiti State, the government has resolved to put stringent measures that will serve as check on sexual violence. It will henceforth conduct compulsory psychiatric test and publish the names and photographs of offenders on the website of the Ministry of Justice. The names of such offenders, according to the government, would also be announced on the state-owned radio and television stations, while the monarchs of the towns the culprits hailed from would be alerted. Addressing reporters yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, Attorney General and Justice Commissioner Wale Fapohunda expressed worries that the menace kept increasing despite high number of convictions recorded. He said Governor Kayode Fayemi was disturbed by increasing cases of sexual violence, adding that there was need for proactive actions to nip the situation in the bud. Fapohunda said the new measures would support the aggressive prosecution and exclusion of offenders from governor’s prerogative of mercy that were already in place. “The additional measures put in place include pasting the photographs of convicted offenders in prominent public spaces in their communities and local government headquarters. “Issuing an advisory to the traditional rulers of the offenders’ communities on the status of the offenders. Uploading the sex offenders’ photographs on the website of the Ministry of Justice. “Showing photographs of sex offenders on Ekiti State Television, announcing their names on radio and television. “Compulsory psychiatric test for persons of whom the Director of Public Prosecution has issued a case to answer legal advice for the offence of child defilement. This also includes persons standing trials,” he said.
