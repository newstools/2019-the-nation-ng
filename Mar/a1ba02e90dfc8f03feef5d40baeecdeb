Dubai Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism) has unveiled it’s 2019 marketing campaign package tagged, Dubai Face Off projects ,which focusing on an A-list cast of celebrities onboard for a unique duel-in-the-desert complete with exclusive travel packages that let fans travel with the stars for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. This new campaign was created on the back of widely successful 2018 Girl’s Trip that featured celebrities like Omoni Oboli, Uche Jombo, Ufuoma McDermott, Chioma Akpotha and Chioma “Chigul” Omeruah on an adventurous week-long girlfriend’s trip to Dubai which was extensively covered in the social media. Garnering over 57 million impressions, the Girl’s Trip featured suicide-door Tesla vehicles, a swim with dolphins, mouthwatering cuisine, a seaplane ride, frolicking in the desert and more. The trip also evoked an equally envious response amongst other A-list male celebrities who called for their own version – a guy’s trip to Dubai to rival the girl’s – and thus the Dubai Face Off was born. The trip with A-list male celebrities will feature a return of the “girls” in a head-to-head challenge. Stars to watch out for include Alexx Ekubo, IK Ogbonna, Yomi Casual and comedian Ayo Richard Makun. Interestingly, they would be competing to see who would stand out of the pack and have the most memorable time in Dubai.
