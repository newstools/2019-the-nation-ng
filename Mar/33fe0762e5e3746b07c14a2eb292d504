You know we are leading as it is now, what we want to do now is to cap it up. “Insha Allah, by tomorrow, even if the inspector General of police comes to Bauchi, the people of Bauchi will still decide who they want. “We are good to go, PDP is not afraid of election and moreso, we have won this election and we will continue to win ” Akuyam said the party remained committed to the peaceful conduct of the re-run elections. He added the party has no reason to be afraid of the outcome as it is in a good position to win. He said further the supplementary election would be taking place in well- known areas where the party had strong showing in the previous exercise, which was declared inconclusive. “I want to assure the good people of Bauchi State that we are facing the polls with an open an peaceful mind and we call on all our citizens in the affected areas where re run will be conducted to remain and troop out en masse to exercise their civic responsibilities.” The PDP had threatened not to participate in the supplementary election after INEC released date for the rerun.
