Ahead of Gubernatorial elections, the Association of Person Living with Disabilities in Kaduna State on Wednesday in Kaduna, offered special prayers for lasting peace during and after the elections. The convener, Malam Abdullahi Samaila, said participants in the prayer session came from the 23 local government area of the state. According to him, people with disabilities suffer the most whenever caught up in violence, hence their decision to seek God’s intervention to avert any crisis during the elections on Saturday. Samaila expressed concern over the religious toga the campaign for the governorship seat in the state has taken, saying it is recipe for violence. He blamed the situation on desperate politicians and religious leaders, stressing that people should be allowed to vote based on their convictions in tune with democratic principle. “We must remember that Nigeria is our home, we must join hands and pray hard for God to keep this nation united,” he added. He congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his victory and urged him to initiate programmes that would benefit people with disabilities, including giving employment to their children who graduated from tertiary institutions. Samaila expressed satisfaction over the commitment by Nigerian journalists toward peaceful conduct of 2019 general elections. “The media has really educated, enlighten, informed and sensitized the public ahead of the the elections and after.” NAN
