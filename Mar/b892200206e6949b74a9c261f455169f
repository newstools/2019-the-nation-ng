The Etsako Solidarity Front (ESF) has told Gen. Charles Airhiavbere (rtd) to drop his ambition of contesting the 2020 governorship in Edo State. It said there was no vacancy in the Government House until 2024 when Governor Godwin Obaseki must have completed his second term. After a meeting in Auchi, headquarters of Etsako West Local Government Area, the group said its support for Obaseki’s second term was because the state has witnessed silent revolution in infrastructural development. The President, Saidu Momoh, said there were underground plots by some persons to interrupt the state’s steady growth and development under Obaseki. Momoh said the group would mobilise the people to stop the plot as demonstrated in the just concluded House of Assembly elections. He said: “I think it’s time to make our position known that Governor Godwin Obaseki cannot be intimidated or blackmailed by anybody from contesting in 2020. “We are tired of this talk that he will not get his second term because he is not sharing the state resources to service professional politicians. “Obaseki has demonstrated purposeful leadership and we are happy with him. Edo people will continue to support him to ensure that there is sustainability of the people-oriented projects he has embarked upon which are visible to all. “As a body, we are ready to expose those plotting Obaseki’s ouster. It is time to remind them that Edo is not Lagos State. No man is God.”
