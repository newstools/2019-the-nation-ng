AMID complaints by customers, Ikeja Electric (IE) Plc has set up a Bill Dispute Resolution Panel (BDRP)  to expedite action on disputed bills. In a statement yesterday, the electricity distribution company (DisCo) said the gesture was to mitigate customers’ complaints about estimated bills. The panel, which comprises workers with expertise in the business operations and customer services will meet customers once monthly across IE’s six business units to tackle such complaints. The panel, the statement said,  would be empowered to resolve “these cases expeditiously, relying on company processes and regulatory requirements.” The idea of setting up the panel is to quickly and amicably resolve lingering service issues raised by customers, it added. The statement reads: “In a service industry like the power sector, disputes occurring as a result of dissatisfaction from a customer are inevitable. However, if inadequately managed, disputes can be bad for business and even go as far as negatively impacting on the customer’s loyalty and business brand. So, we understand that fact and we are doing the best within our control to manage our customer’s expectations. “In line with our business objectives, we seek to be the provider of choice. Our customers need to be satisfied for us to be in business. The BDRP also enables customers plan their visits according to their itinerary, since the panel sits for resolution once every month. This initiative is in addition to the daily attendance to customers’ complaints through the Customer Service channels and the IE offices across the network.”
