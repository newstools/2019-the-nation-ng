Kaduna State Governor Malam Nasir El-Rufai on Wednesday evening ended the rumour of his involvement in a fatal accident, which allegedly claimed life of his driver on the spot. El-Rufai, according to his spokesman, Samuel Aruwan, arrived Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Wednesday afternoon wearing a cheerful face. Rumours were rife in hush tones that El-Rufai was involved in an accident. The rumours, however, became louder last Thursday when it was reported the governor was injured and his driver dead instantly. But, El-Rufai who reacted to the rumour, attributed it to the opposition party members. He said he was neither in coma nor was his driver dead as being speculated. El-Rufai, on his official Facebook page, wrote: “I woke up after a rare 8-hour bout of deep sleep to learn that some bigotry-driven, PDP-affiliated fake news platform has declared my driver dead and my humble self in coma. Both claims are false. “I thank them for reducing the days in their lives and adding them to mine. “I remain their permanent nightmare and not about to disappear from their wretched and corrupt lives any time soon by the Grace of Almighty Allah, until they are permanently retired and buried.” But despite the rebuttal, another round of rumour spread he was in coma in a hospital in Germany. Aruwan, in a short Facebook post this evening, inferred the Governor’s arrival has ended the rumour, asking the mongers to proceed to the next issue. According to him: “Ever smiling and cheerful Governor Nasir El-Rufai at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Next story!” His post was accompanied with two photographs showing the Governor smiling while pulling his luggage.
