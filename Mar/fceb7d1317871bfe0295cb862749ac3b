Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the United Kingdom (UK) have donated items worth millions of naira to support the  governorship bid  Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Lagos State APC Chairman Babatunde Balogun received the items which include  wheel chairs, notepads, exercise books and other educational materials from the Tayo Sodeinde-led  group in his Acme Road, Ikeja office,  at the weekend. Sodeinde said: “APC in the UK has always been playing a vital role in every election held in the state. “We were here during the last election and we were warmly received by the former chairman of APC in Lagos, Chief Henry Ajomale. “We have brought wheel chairs to enable the physically-challenged members of the party move around. We also brought exercise books for the children for their education, notepads and handkerchiefs. “We are using this medium to congratulate you on your brilliant performance within a short period of your being in office,” Sodeinde said. The team described APC stalwart Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as a pillar of support. Balogun thanked the group for its gesture, saying : “You have shown great passion and service to this party and each time you are here, you have never come with an empty hand. I thank you for alleviating the suffering of the physically challenged among members of our party’’. The group visited the Sanwo-Olu Independent Campaign Group (ICG) in Ikeja, GRA, where some items were handed over to the Director General, Mr. Tayo Ayinde.
