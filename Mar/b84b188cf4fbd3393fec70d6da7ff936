Arsenal attacker, Alex Iwobi has received fresh tips from the club’s coach, Unai Emery, who believes the Super Eagles star needs to keep improving and always stay calm in front of goal. On the backdrop of rave reviews trailing Iwobi’s performance against Bournemouth in midweek, sports247.ng reported that Emery was happy to see the youngster staying consistent, but said he must work harder. Iwobi has made 24 appearances in the English Premier League so far this season, scoring three goals, but Emery stressed that The Gunners’ former U-21 team captain can do more. Emery said: “Iwobi can open space on the overlap for them. So I think Iwobi is giving a lot for us. “We want to play and we want to create our philosophy and I think that Iwobi is important, but he needs to carry on improving. “For us, we have to be demanding from him; and himself be desiring to improve the things that he can get better at in his qualities. “When he’s getting into the attacking third into the box, he be calm to decide the last action with assists and scoring more,” Emery said.
