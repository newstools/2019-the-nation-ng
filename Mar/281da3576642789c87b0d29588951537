The Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) has won the two state constituencies in which supplementary election took place on Saturday, according to results obtained from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Sunday afternoon. The PDP candidate in Nassarawo/Binyeri State Constituency in Mayo-Belwa LGA, Umar Nashon, won the contest in that constituency by polling 10,733 votes against the 7,185 received by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In the Uba/Gaya State Constituency in Hong LGA, Abbas Aminu Iya of the PDP narrowly defeated his APC opponent, Mohammed Atiku. Abass Iya got 7,251 votes while Mohammed Atiku had 7,238 votes. With the two wins, the PDP now has 13 seats in the next session of the Adamawa State House of Assembly to post a slim majority. The PDP and APC got eleven seats each when the main state House of Assembly election was conducted on March 9. The African Democratic Congress (ADC) won one seat during the March 9 election. The state assembly comprises 25 seats. The supplementary election had been fixed for Saturday in the two state constituencies after the March 9 election was postponed in Nasarawo/Binyeri because a candidate died close to the election, while votes were cancelled in three polling units in Uba/Gaya during the March 9 election there.
