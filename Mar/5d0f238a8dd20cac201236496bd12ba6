It has been revealed that a lot of young girls were trafficked during the June 2018 World Cup. Russian Interior Ministry reported last week that the number of fans still stranded had reduced to 5,500. According to Evgeni Yastrebov, a consultant on immigration issues with Civic Assistance Committee, an organisation that works with refugees in Russia told the BBC in an interview, that many of those fans have been stranded in Russia and desperately in need of help. “Many of them came from Nigeria, with some from Cameroon, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and Bangladesh. “They were looking to apply for asylum and stay here and that didn’t work out and now many of them are getting deported on a daily basis. “The [Russian] government offers no assistance to people who want to seek asylum and stay in Russia and right now these people are struggling. “Right now it’s winter and it’s very cold and they need warm clothing. Some of them get money sent to them from home and some engage in unofficial jobs but they are underpaid and it’s not enough to take care of themselves.”
