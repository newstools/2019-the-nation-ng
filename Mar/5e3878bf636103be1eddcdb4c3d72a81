A 23-year-old man, Joachim Kikogble, who allegedly cut his neighbour with a razor blade for failing to buy him cigarette, is facing a charge of assault at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye alleged that Kikogble, who lives in Yaba, cut the hand of Mr. Solomon Mifokpo because he refused to buy a packet of cigarette for him. The prosecutor alleged that the defendant committed the offence on March 11, at Oko-Agbon Street, Yaba. The defendant, she said, stopped Mifokpo on the street and made the request. “My Lord, when the complainant refused to buy the cigarette, it resulted in an argument and then a fight. “The defendant brought out a razor blade from his pocket and cut the complainant on his right hand. “The complainant had to be taken to a pharmacy to get treated,” Olaluwoye said. She said the defendant had a misunderstanding with the complainant. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendant N50,000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. She said one of the sureties must be a relation of the defendant, adding that the  sureties must be employed and possess evidence of three years’ tax payment to the state government. The case was adjourned till June 26.
