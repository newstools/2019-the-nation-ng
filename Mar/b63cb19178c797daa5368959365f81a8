Rotary Club of Omole-Golden, in conjunction with Rotaract Club of Omole-Golden, has empowered the less privileged by giving them tools. The empowerment, which was done to commemorate the 2019 World Rotaract Week, was held yesterday in Ogba, Ikeja, Lagos. The President, Mrs. Ibironke Alaba, urged the recipients to use the items well. She said the empowerment, which was a joint project on vocational service, was being done by the clubs as part of their humanitarian services. A former President of the club, Mr. Abiodun Oshinibosi, said the empowerment was being carried out to enhance businesses and support people. Oshinibosi said: “You need to build a good relationship with your customers. You need to prioritise customer relationship. You should interact with your customers and prospective customers. If you do this, you will retain their patronage and secure new ones. Learn to treat your customers and clients well. Do them right.” Rotaract Club of Omole-Golden President Deji Sobowale hailed Rotary Club of Omole-Golden for being a role model, a motivator and a supporter. A recipient, Mrs. Yinka Fusigboye, a hairdresser, who was given a dryer, on behalf of others, thanked the clubs for their gesture. She said: “We will use the equipment well and obey the advice given us.” Other recipients are Mr. Ope Adebayo, Mr Kehinde Fatai and Mr Olusola Adedayo, who received a pair of clippers each, Mrs. Iyabo Adebola got a drive (a machine used to check sugar level) and Miss Temitope Oladunwo, a sewing machine.
