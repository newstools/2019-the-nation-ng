A lecturer in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, Mr Patrick Okojie, has committed suicide three days to his 47th birthday. The decaying body of Okojie was found at his plot of land at Igbira Camp, along Igarra/Auchi Road, four days after he was said to have been missing. Okojie, who left behind a wife and three children, was said to have been due for promotion to chief instructor by this month ending before he died. Family sources said he did not leave any suicide note. It was, however, gathered that he had made two previous attempts at committing suicide.
