Taraba state Governor, Darius Ishaku has said that he sees his second coming as an opportunity for him to heal all the ethnic, socio-political and religious wounds in the state. He dedicated the election to Taraba people who, he said, turned out in numbers to decide in his favour. Ishaku, who spoke to journalists on his victory, condemned the “hooliganism” used by politicians during the polls. He said: “The campaigns for the elections, in a way, have shaken the foundation of our unity as a people. Peace that we all labored collectively to achieve was gravely threatened on the altar of sentiments that we need not promote. “We all owe ourselves, particularly the generation of young Tarabans, the duty to downplay such divisive tendencies and work together assiduously for the unity and progress of our dear state. “To members of other political parties who contested the election with us, I commend your courage and efforts. In politics, as in all games involving contestants, there is always a loser and there is always a winner. “My reelection is to heal the wounds of divisions in Taraba state. Therefore, I extend the olive branch across political borderlines to build a relationship that will enable all of us serve our people creditably. “Service to the people is the ultimate goal of politics and governance. Nothing must be done to undermine that concept of our roles and duties as leaders of our people.” The governor revealed he was happier winning a second term, because “it shows I have served the people well and they want me to continue. It is better to serve than to be served.” Ishaku, an architect, revealed that his second coming was to “consolidate” on the gains of what his administration did in the first four years. “The first term was a foundation laying stage. Now, we are going to erect the building and provide the roof to complete the structure,” he said.
