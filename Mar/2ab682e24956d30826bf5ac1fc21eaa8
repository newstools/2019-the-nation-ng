The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau state and its governorship candidate Jeremiah Useni have declared results of the supplementary poll declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as unacceptable The main opposition party also vowed to challenge the victory of Gov Simon Lalong in court. “The mandate given to PDP by the majority of people of Plateau state has been stolen by PDP and we will follow all the legal processes to reclaim our stolen mandate,” Useni said in Jos shortly after Lalong was declared winner. According to him: “My team and I have gone through both the official results released by INEC and the documents submitted by our own field staff. “We have every reason to believe that justice has so far not been done to our people in this election, because of massive rigging and electoral shortcomings. “After due consultation, I hereby state that the results announced by INEC are not acceptable to us. “Consequently, we have requested our legal team to activate all the due processes to reclaim our cherished mandate. I give you my word that we will pursue this matter diligently, and by the grace of God, we will overturn and recover the people’s mandate. “The *Restoration* Agenda is for the soul of Plateau State, until its glory is restored. I thank all leaders, stakeholders, members and supporters of the PDP for their commitment, hard work and sacrifices so far. “Your labour will not go in vain. I appeal to all of us to unite all the more now and avoid any bickering and blame-giving. Unity of purpose must be the source of our strength. “Let us remain focused on the struggle and avoid anything else that will distract and divide us. I want you to know that it is not yet over. This is only a temporary setback. We have entered another critical stage. “Let us stand together for God and for Plateau State.”
