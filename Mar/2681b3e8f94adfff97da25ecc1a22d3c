Nigeria’s senior soccer team manager Gernot Rohr has stated that the Super Eagles are 70 per cent ready for the battles arising from matches slated for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), stressing that Pharaohs of Egypt game on Tuesday inside the late Stephen Keshi Stadium was great. Although Eagles’ striker Paul Onuachu’s first-minute strike raised hopes of a likely goal-scoring spree, which never happened since the goal decided the game. But Rohr argued further that: “We decided to make a fast start. It was a planned goal from the kickoff. We have a tall striker from Denmark (Onuachu), he did very well but he has to improve still. We made five changes with two local players making their debut. It will be good for them and their career. “All the time we must improve but let us enjoy this wonderful moment. We scored a wonderful goal. Tomorrow, we will analyse this game and go back to work on the team we have to make them better. I think the team is 70% ready but I like the number 69. “The match was a great match for us and when you play a great team like Egypt, which for me is one of the favourites for the AFCON and win, it feels good. What was interesting for me also in Asaba was that we had three wonderful victories. First, we beat Seychelles, the U-23 team also trounced Libya and now we beat Egypt. So it was a good week for us,” Rohr said without stating who his best players were over the two matches against Seychelles and Egypt.
