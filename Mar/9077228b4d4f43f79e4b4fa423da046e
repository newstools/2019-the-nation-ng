The African Development Bank (AfDB) is partnering South Korea to step up technology transfers to Africa.Its President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, made this known during a three-day visit to South Korea. Adesina said: “The future is going to be an exponentially different,” noting that the bank intends to “explore the creation of a strategic partnership with Korea that could lead to the creation of a Korea-Africa research and training Drone Centre that could help pave the way for Africa’s fourth Industrial Revolution”. Adesina said the AfDB was determined to expand the use of drones in agriculture in Africa. “What we do in Africa today will determine global food security tomorrow,” he said. The AfDB boss noted that it was important that the technological partnership with Korea translates into capacity building on the ground, through training, so that Africa can industrialise, build or assemble drones. During the visit, representatives of Busan Metropolitan City, Busan Techno Park, and Korea’s Green Technology Centre said there was huge potential for cooperation and immense opportunities for job-creating bankable projects. According to the Global Strategy Division, Green Technology Centre Director, Hyung-Ju Kim, “Korean expertise can provide a practical and pragmatic solution to a wide range of Africa’s most pressing technology needs.”
