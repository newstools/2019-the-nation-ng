First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has unveild-  another value-added initiative called SheVentures for women-owned Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs). The initiative will provide enhanced support to existing and upcoming women-owned SMEs through access to finance, training and mentoring to boost their business in a sustainable manner. This initiative is the FCMB Women in Business Unit, and was launched at an impressive ceremony on March 7 in Lagos as part of the Bank’s activities to celebrate this year’s International Women’s Day under the theme Balancing for Better. At the ceremony, some women SME operators received loans ranging from N500,000.00 to N5,000,000.00. In a statement, FCMB explained that SheVentures is anchored on a unique selling proposition of ‘’Be You’’, which connotes confidence, independence and the courage required by women to fulfill their aspirations.  It is designed to engage, inspire and equip potential and existing women entrepreneurs to take bold steps that would launch their business to greater heights. SheVentures comes with several cutting-edge features and benefits for women-owned SMEs. One of such is the zero-interest rate for an initial period of three months.  In addition, FCMB will organise free training and mentoring  programmes  for 80 women entrepreneurs  every quarter, out of which 40 of  them will  access this loan.
