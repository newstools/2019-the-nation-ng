The Vice Chancellor, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, Prof. Joseph Ahaneku, has warned students against cultism, forgery, examination malpractices and other vices throughout their stay. He said cultism and deviant behaviours remained an anathema and would not be tolerated. Speaking at the weekend during the matriculation of over 9,000 regular and Continuous Education Programme (CEP) students, Ahaneku warned that misconducts attracted expulsion. He listed payment of school fees and attendance of 75 per cent lectures in all courses as prerequisites for successful graduation of students. Ahaneku said: “You must take your studies seriously and avoid associations capable of jeopardising your future. “The university has provided you with congenial environment and welfare facilities for your development in character and learning. “These facilities include a work-aid scheme to assist indigent students who attain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.50; a Group Personal Insurance and well-equipped hostels.” The vice chancellor said the institution enjoyed full accreditations in all the 107 programmes across the 14 faculties. “The institution has linkages with universities across the world to facilitate academic programmes development, teaching/research and staff/student exchange,” he added.
