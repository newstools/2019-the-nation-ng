 In a concerted effort to groom youths in vocations and technical skills, Edo State Government through its skills development platform, EdoJobs, has partnered with MacPrices Limited, NAT Limited and Doma Furniture on extended woodworks and furniture training course for youths in the state. The programme is designed as an earn-as-you-learn package which will see trainees placed on regular stipends as they learn new craft. Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Jobs Creation and Skills Development, Mrs. Ukinebo Dare, said that the state government is committed to grooming youths on vocations and technical education so that they can meaningfully contribute to the state’s economy. According to her, “We have entered into a partnership that will see the participants of the training placed on an earn-as-you-learn package for a period ranging from one to two years. This will guarantee that they are comfortable and are able to remain. According to her, “EdoJobs is partnering with Doma Furniture, NAT Limited and Macprices Limited to train a total of 70 Edo youths on wood works and furniture making. Some of them will learn to work as machinists. Doma Funiture will train 30 beneficiaries for two years while NAT Limited and Macprices Limited will respectively train 20 beneficiaries for one year.” She assured that the process for selecting participants in the training will be transparent as everyone will be given a fair opportunity to participate, noting, “At Edojobs, we ensure that all qualified persons get an opportunity to partake in our training and this will be no different.”
