Addressing reporters in Lagos, its President, Mr Babatunde Ruwase said there was need for the government to formulate economic policies that will promote investors’ confidence and see a rebound in the tempo of economic activities. He said: “The government should therefore, commit to policies and programmes that will accelerate economic growth and ensure that the growth rate surpasses the rate of growth of population. “Private sector investment is a critical growth driver; therefore, the government should vommit to the creation of an enabling environment to bring about a quantum leap in private investment.” Ruwase urged Buhari to ensure that “tax policy, trade policy and the foreign exchange policy must be in alignment with this objective”.
