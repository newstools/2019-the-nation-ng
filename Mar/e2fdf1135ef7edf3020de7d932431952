 Ilkay Gundogan revealed talks over a new contract will resume at the end of the season, with his Manchester City future in doubt. The midfielder’s deal only runs until 2020 and Pep Guardiola has urged him to pen fresh terms. Gundogan is keeping his options open and could leave the Etihad Stadium. City may have a decision on whether or not to cash in on him this summer ‘There is no decision yet otherwise I would’ve signed,’ Gundogan said. ‘I’d say we are still in talks but I don’t feel much pressure. ‘After the season we’ll talk again. My main target at the moment is going for all four competitions. ‘Playing under Pep is the main thing now. One day we’ll need to make a decision.’ The 28-year-old has suggested he may look for a new challenge in another country ahead. Gundogan had only played in Germany until joining City in 2016. ‘This is something you decide for yourself,’ he added. ‘My next contract will decide where I’ll maybe finish my career. ‘Everyone feels different; maybe they have an inner feeling to go for a new challenge. I’m always open-minded for challenges. ‘It’s a personal situation. It’s not obvious, you have to make their own decision and I try to play as well as possible. ‘In modern football, especially if you have ambitions, you have to prove that you have to play under these demands, this number of games and the intensity. ‘There is not a huge difference between here and somewhere else.’
