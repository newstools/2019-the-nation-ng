Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on Friday commissioned the 1.1 kilometer Gidan Zakkah – Kofar Waika road in Kano metropolis, constructed by his administration valued at about N 270 million. Ganduje explained that the project was conceived following the noticeable hardship faced by commuters within the densely populated area, particularly during the rainy season. “This project is one of the road projects we constructed in Kano city to ensure easy flow of traffic and to generally reduce flooding, since some of the old roads do not have culverts. As you can see this road has concrete gutters and will soon be fitted with street lights. “As we can see, change is visible within this area as the quality of homes and indeed the environment is looking modern while people can now use their vehicles’ conveniently. “Even those walking on foot will be happier as pavements have been constructed,” he stated. Ganduje expressed the commitment of his administration to ensure speedy completion of more roads especially in the state capital to consolidate its urban renewal programme. “Because of our population and the arrival of people to do business, our city is growing and gradually becoming a mega city. This means that we must invest in critical infrastructure like roads to facilitate movement of goods and services,” he stressed. The governor called on the people in the Goron Dutse – Kofar Waika axis of Kano city to make good use of the road and to support the government to enable it accomplish its vision.‎ Commissioner for Works, Housing and Transport, Engr. Aminu Aliyu Wudil explained street lights would be installed at designated points along the road while the Kofar Waika Gate would be reconstructed at the end of the road, to preserve the state’s history and culture. He disclosed that the second phase of the road, which would cover Kofar Waika to Dawakin Tofa would commence before long.
