Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has threatened to deal with some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) whose activities led to the defeat of the party in the February 23rd general elections. The APC lost the election by polling 267,842 against the 275,691 scored by the to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Government sources said what peeved Governor Obaseki was the wide margin of defeat recorded in Egor, Ikpoba-Okha and Oredo local government areas in Edo South senatorial district. Obaseki, who hails from Oredo in Edo South senatorial, was said to have issued the threat at a meeting with APC leaders. A source at the meeting, who spoke in a chat with newsmen and pleaded anonymity, said Obaseki challenged the affected leaders to reveal what he gave to them. The source said the Governor was almost moved to tears as he expressed his disappointment with some of the leaders especially when it was revealed one of the leaders did not buy generators meant for Ward collation centres. According to the source, “We were shocked when Obaseki started talking. He revealed so many things. He said he was shocked how the leaders sabotaged his efforts. Obaseki asked them if it were his re-election, that is how he would have lost. “The Governor spoke to a point that he threw away the microphone. None of the leaders utter any word in defense. He has said he would deal with them. “We are happy that the Governor set up a 25-man team to work with him for the purpose of the House of Assembly election this Saturday.”
