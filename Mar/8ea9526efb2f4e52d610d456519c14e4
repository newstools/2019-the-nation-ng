A 20-year-old rape suspect, James Aguedo, yesterday urged an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Special Offences Court to grant him bail to enable him sit for his examination. Aguedo, who attends Babcock University, Ilishan, Ogun State, is one of the five students charged with the gang-rape of a University of Lagos (UNILAG) undergraduate. His co-defendants are Moboluwaji Omowole, 19, Chuka Chukwu, 19, Peace Nwankama, 19, and Josephine Osemeka, 20. Aguedo made the bail request through his counsel, Mr. Lawal Pedro (SAN), before Justice Abiola Soladoye. Pedro prayed the court to allow Aguedo to go and  write the examination coming up next month. He said: “By April, he is to start his examination at Babcock University. We urge your lordship to exercise discretion on the most compassionate grounds and grant the defendant bail for him to take part in the examination.” Pedro noted that Aguedo had a health challenge and was charged with a misdemeanour. “The defendant is suffering from a recurring back ailment. We brought not just a medical report, but also the history, because he has been attending an orthopaedic hospital,” he added. Opposing the request, the prosecutor, Mrs. Fehinti Ogbemudia, said : “The prosecution submits that the application for bail lacks merit and should be refused’’. Justice Soladoye reserved ruling till April 18. Aguedo and the others are facing  a three-count charge of defilement of a child, permitting defilement of a child on a premises and procuration. They are being held in Kirikiri Prisons pending the conclusion of their trial.
