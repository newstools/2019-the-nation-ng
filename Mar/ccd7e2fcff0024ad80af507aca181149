Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri suffered a major setback in his quest for European title with his Portuguese club – Sporting after the team was beaten 3-0 in the second leg of the semifinal tie against France’s GV Hennebont in this year’s ETTU Cup. Having been beaten at home 2-3 by the French team fortnight ago, Quadri’s team – Sporting were hoping to turn the tide against the star-studded French team but the huge home support coupled with the flawless play by the home team became the undoing of the visitors. Sporting were heading to Paris with a lot of confidence and in the first game, Englishman Liam Pitchford who has been the inspiration to the French team was set up against Sporting Joao Monteiro. The match had all the qualities of the semifinal tie but it was the Englishman that had an edge in the encounter beating Monteiro 11-7, 11-7, 7-11, 11-6. The second game involving Quadri and Chinese-born Sheng Peng Fan became the joker for the home team as the Nigerian fell 7-11, 11-9, 9-11, 11-7, 11-2 for the French side to have a 2-0 lead. Just like it happened in the first leg, situation repeated itself in the deciding match, as Belgian Cedric Nuytinck and Portugeuse Diogo Carvalho were set up against each other. This time, it was the Belgian that dominated the encounter with 11-8, 12-10, 11-6 win to complete the 3-0 rout for the French side to have a 6-2 win aggregate and progress to the final. After failing at same stage in the ETTU Champions League last year, Quadri again failed at same stage of the ETTU Cup and hoping that he will make it to the final next season. G.V. Hennebont will play against Germany’s Saarbrücken Tischtennis in the final of the ETTU Cup.
