THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State yesterday called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the results of the last Saturday presidential and National Assembly election in the state. Its chairman, Kola Shittu said this in Ilorin, the state capital, while addressing reporters on the outcome of the election. He  said the party was ready to employ legal means to redress what he descibe as manifest irregularities that characterised the elections across the three senatorial districts. Shittu  who was flanked by other executive members of the party,  said the elections were marred by electoral malpractices, malfunctioning of 90 percent of card readers, multiple voting as well as over- voting. He said: “We call on INEC to cancel the election because its outcome does not reflect the wishes of the people”, he said, adding : “We also received report of how APC agents made use of unclaimed PVCs to vote at some polling units across the State particularity within Kwara Central. Also, many of the local observers accredited by INEC to monitor the election were APC members. “Additionally, prior to the day of the election, the Federal Government backed APC made some retrogressive and undemocratic moves, using state apparatus to intimidate and arrest some of our members and supporters in some parts of the state.” Asked if the party was ready to approach  the tribunal for redress, the PDP chairman said once a political party announces its dissociation from an election result,  there are procedures for it to follow.
