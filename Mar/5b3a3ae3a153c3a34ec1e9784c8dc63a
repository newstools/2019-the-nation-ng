The final week of the 2019 GTBank Lagos International Polo Tournament galloped off yesterday with ten teams in action in the Low and Majekodunmi Cups. With the first phase concluded last weekend, which saw Kaduna Trapcco and Lagos NRT emerge champions of the Silver and Open Cup titles, eight teams will start the quest for the Low Cup with Lagos teams, A+/RCF and Weyland STL slugging it out in the first match of the day. The former, formed by Mumuni Musa, Pedro Soria, Ahmadu Umar and Natalie Allan – the only female player in the tournament for the third successive year – alongside Port Harcourt Strata Base, is the highest handicapped team in the Low Cup with +8. Kano Nakudu and Iyatu Farms will then try each other for size in the second match before Lintex/ Sublime face off Anadariya in the penultimate Low Cup match which has seven Lagos teams and six visiting teams in contention. Northern Nigeria rivals AGAD and Kano Ibah will round off hostilities in the Low Cup which will see the best four placed teams advanced to the semi-finals. The day’s activities will be concluded with the mouthwatering Majekodunmi Cup game between Lagos Centraus and Almat Farms from Kano. Centraus are at +16 handicap with Bode Majankuola and Adeyemo Alakija alongside two Argentine professionals but Almat at +15 are no pushovers with Chris Mackenzie +7, Andre Crespo +5, Maurice Ikpeyong 0 and Idris Badamasi +3 forming a formidable team.
