Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has said the society should show compassion to retirees and senior citizens, “because they have sacrificed their yesterday for our today.” He said: “Those who retired from the Lagos State Public Service have invaluable experience. For this reason, we must appreciate them. We may or may not know the challenges they have faced in life, but they have definitely gained experience worth respecting and learning from.” The governor, represented by Establishments, Training and Pensions Commissioner Dr. Benson Akintola, said his administration understood and appreciated the role public servants played in governance. He spoke yesterday in Ikeja at the opening session of a training for directors and those close to retirement. The workshop tagged: “Planning for Retirement: Pension Reforms in the Lagos State Public Service”, was organised by the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions and facilitated by Messrs. Human Capital Management & Solutions Ltd. Ambode said: “In order to attend to the needs of retirees, the government has approved a proposal to reach out to the retirees and impart to them, knowledge by experienced facilitators on how to cope with the challenges of retirement.” He said the seminar was organised for the civil servants and others in the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Teachers’ Establishment and Pensions Office (TEPO), parastatals and local governments, who would soon retire or have recently retired. The Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said the training was important and timely. He said any worker who did not prepare for retirement would not have anything to fall back on later in life. Ogundipe hoped that with the way the government was planning for its workforce, none should suffer after retiring. He hailed the Ambode administration for the novel step.
