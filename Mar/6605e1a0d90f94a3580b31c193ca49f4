Serena Williams Serena Williams has been dealt an extremely difficult draw in her return to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. Despite receiving a first-round bye, Williams is in line to face a plethora of tennis superstars on her way to reclaiming the title she won back in 1999 and 2001. Williams, a 23-time women singleâ€™s grand slam champion, could face Victoria Azarenka in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open. Of course, Azarenka has to make it past her compatriot Lapko Vera first to set up a rematch against Williams. Victoria Azarenka is a former world number one and an Olympics Bronze medallist trails Serena Williams in their head-to-head matchup. However, Azarenka defeated Williams in their last meeting to win the title in the 2016 Indian Wells Masters. Serena Williams could face world number 15 Garbine Muguruza in the third round. Muguruza, a former world number one herself, also has a first-round bye and will face the winner between Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Lauren Davis. Williams leads Muguruza in their head-to-head matchup. However, Garbine Muguruza defeated Williams the last time they lined up against each other at the finals of the 2016 French Open. If Williams can win against Garbine Muguruza, she could face the seventh-seed Kiki Bertens in the round of 16 and then the fourth-seed Sloane Stephens in the quarter-finals provided that these seeded players also make it through.
