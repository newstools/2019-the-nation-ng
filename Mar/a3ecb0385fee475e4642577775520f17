POPULAR American rapper, Rick Ross, is set to release his first memoir, ‘Hurricanes’, a story which is centred around his past life, both as a drug dealer and correctional officer. According to the report, the memoir is co-written by Neil Martinez-Belkin, the same writer who co-wrote Gucci Mane’s ‘The Autobiography of Gucci Mane’. “In Hurricanes, Ross moves beyond the headlines, opening up about the experiences that inform his creative process. His upbringing in Carol City. His past as both a drug dealer and correctional officer. His scuffles in the streets and in the industry. The seizures. The drive-by shootings. The 2015 arrest on kidnapping and assault charges. “It is a remarkable story of not only surviving the storms of life but reaching the highest levels of achievement in spite of them. “My story has always been deeper than rap. With this book, I wanted to go deeper than I ever have. I wanted to tell people about the life of William Leonard Roberts,” enthused Ross.
