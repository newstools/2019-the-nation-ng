A man, simply identified as Harrison Mukoro, was on Sunday morning found dead in Emevor community, Isoko North council area of Delta state, with severe cuts all over his body. Although no member of the community could volunteer any credible information about the person of the deceased or the possible circumstances surrounding his death, the state police command, on Sunday afternoon, linked the killing to cult related activities. Many of the people approached information would not want to offer information make comments as it became obvious that the entire community had been under panic since the discovery of the deceased’s corpse. However, when reached for an official confirmation of the development, the Delta state Commissioner of Police, Mr Adeyinka Adeleke, during a telephone conversation, said the incident bore looks of a cult-related killing. According to Adeleke, the victim was axed to death, adding that investigation was already ongoing. “There are no details for now other than it became obvious that he was axed to death in an attack that looks very much like a cult-related incident. Investigation is on though and as soon as we have enough clues and lay our hands on the perpetrators, more will be revealed”, he said.
