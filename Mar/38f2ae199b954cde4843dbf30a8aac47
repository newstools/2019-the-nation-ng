•It is welcome that guilty officials have been identified to forfeit their takings Just like the previous initiatives set up to ameliorate the deplorable conditions of the Niger Delta, the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) set up by the Umaru Yar’Adua administration in 2009 has, regrettably, also been dogged by corruption. The latest of this has resulted in a court order, on March 1, 2019, to 17 former officials of the Presidential Amnesty Programme Office to forfeit about N732.85million stolen from the office to the Federal Government. Justice James Tsoho of the Federal High Court in Abuja had on November 16, last year, granted an interim forfeiture order, following the ex-parte application filed by the counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He also ordered the commission to advertise the order in the newspapers for any interested party to show cause within 14 days on why the money should not be forfeited to the government. The 17 former PAP officials are General Paul Tarela Boroh (rtd), Hanafi Musa Moriki, Allotey Asari Edem, Joshua Ebiemeyefa, D. Wokoma, Bernard Ochoche and Cecilia Adebisi. Others are: Omofuma Faith, Olusegun Opeyemi Okungbure, Beggi Erepatei, Matti Abdul, Stella Nnamatti, Theresa Okoro, Chika Nsirim, Omonyemen Osunbor, Musa Odiringa, and Ode Martins Olajide. Gen Boroh, a former coordinator of the programme is to forfeit about N124million. We commend the EFCC for its diligent investigations which unearthed the  various sums of N124,000,000; N320,000,000; N68,768,916; N1,900,000; N5,125,000; N3,000,000; N28,595,755; N6,137,000; N40,000,000; N46,800,000; N16,315,000; N2,547,800; N3,900,000; N8,234,650; N6,800,000; N2,651,000, and N1,970,750 traced to the respondents, respectively, leading to the judge granting the order for final forfeiture of the money. President Yar’Adua instituted the programme in response to the clamour by the people in the region for amnesty for militants in the region. The militants had literally held the country by the jugular when, through pipeline bombings and other activities, they succeeded in reducing the country’s crude oil production from over two million barrels per day to less than 700,000 barrels. The programme succeeded in calming frayed nerves, as the amnesty office worked to reintegrate the fighters into society, placing and sponsoring many of them in vocational and higher education courses in Nigeria and overseas. Oil production bounced back and the country has been able to realise more money from crude export, except for occasions when prices plummeted in the international oil market. One would have expected that people who are fortunate to find themselves directing the affairs of such a vital agency would see it as a rare privilege and a call to duty, and thus be patriotic enough to appreciate its essence and the centrality of its operations to the country’s wellbeing by running it transparently and making honesty their watchword. It is a matter for regret that this has not been so, as we have seen in the instant case which has ended in the adoption of non-conviction based forfeiture proceedings. It is also regrettable that similar initiatives instituted in the region to ameliorate the sufferings of the people there recorded similar mindboggling cases of corruption. We refer to the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) established by the Ibrahim Babangida government in 1992 and even its successor, the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) established in 1999. We would have loved a situation where the culprits of such heinous crime are handed jail terms to serve as a deterrent to others. But then, we also understand the consequences on the state’s coffers, especially when those involved are ready to return the amounts outstanding against their names to the government. We can only hope that the process of the plea bargain was thorough and transparent and that the country was not shortchanged. All said, we urge the governments involved in the appointment of people to agencies such as the amnesty office to be thorough in their background checks on the prospective appointees. They must, of necessity, be people of proven integrity. That is the only way the people in the region can have full value for whatever investments the government makes in their interest.
