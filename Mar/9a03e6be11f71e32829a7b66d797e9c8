A self-styled lawyer, Akinyemi Caxton-Martins,  was yesterday arraigned at a Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly swindling a woman under the pretext of facilitating her bail. Caxton-Martins, 56, is being tried on a four-count charge of conspiracy, fraudulently obtaining money under false pretences, impersonation and stealing. Prosecuting Sergeant Adetutu Sanusi said the defendant committed the offence with one other person sometime last month at Surulere, Lagos Mainland. “The defendant obtained N200, 000 from the complainant, Sherifat Hamzat, on the pretext of facilitating her bail at the Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court,” Sanusi alleged. The prosecutor said Caxton-Martins was alleged to have assumed the role of a lawyer, who had the authority to take brief and appear in court to defend the complainant. Chief Magistrate T. O Abayomi granted the defendant N50, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
