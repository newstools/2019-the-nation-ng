Wife of former Vice-President of Nigeria, Dame Beatrice Ekwueme, has urged the Igbos not to allow their different political parties divide them. Ekwueme made the call during the 5th Biennial Inter House Sports Competition of her school at the Federal Polytechnic Sports Centre, Oko, Anambra state. She asked the Igbos to borrow a leaf from the Northerners and Westerners who place their origin above party affiliations. She said, “Both Hausas and Yorubas place their origin above political parties. Ndi Igbo should think towards similar direction. “First and foremost, a Yoruba knows that he is a Yoruba before being a member of a political party. “An Hausa indigene knows that he is Hausa before being a member of a political party. Ndi Igbo, let us think and never allow party politics to tear us apart.’’ Candidate for House of Assembly election under the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in  LGA, Mr Emeka Aforka commended the school for setting the pace for others to follow. Aforka, who launched the 2nd edition of the school’s calendar, thanked Governor Willie Obiano for extending his good governance to the council area. He urged the people of the area to vote for all APGA candidates in the State House of Assembly election on Saturday.
