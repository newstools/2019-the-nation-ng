A Lagos High Court yesterday adjourned the murder trial of a Dane, Peter Schau Nielsen, till April 3, following the absence of the last prosecution witness. Deputy Director of Prosecutions Dr. Jide Martins told Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Ighile that the witness, Dr. Somairi, was not available. Nielsen, 53, is standing trial for the death of his Nigerian singer wife, Zainab, and their three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Petra. He was last June 13  charged with their murder, an offence said to be contrary to Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Nielsen, Zainab, Petra, Gift and Favour Madaki, who are Zainab’s stepsisters, were said to be in the apartment on the night of the incident. The state accused Nielsen of beating up and smothering Zainab and Petra around 3:45am, at No 4, Flat 17, Bella Vista Tower, Banana Island, Ikoyi. At the resumed hearing of the matter yesterday, Martins explained Somairi’s absence. He said last Friday during a pre-trial meeting with the witness, it was discovered that there were other essential information required by the prosecution, which were not before the court. Martins said: “My Lord, the matter for today is for continuation of trial, but, unfortunately, Dr. Somairi, who is our last witness, is not in court. “We were in a pre-trial meeting on Friday and we realised that there are other information very essential and that information is not before the court. “We hope that by Wednesday the information will be ready and we will serve same on the court and the defence. “Our application is for the court to vacate Tuesday (today) and Friday. He is a vital witness, whose testimony will help the court. We are still coming back on Monday.” But Justice Okikiolu-Ighile was not pleased. “Learned Deputy Director, today is wasted, tomorrow is wasted, Friday is wasted. You have disorganised my list,” the judge said. Justice Okikiol-Ighile adjourned till April 3.
