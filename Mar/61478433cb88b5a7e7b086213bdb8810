The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Prof Mahmood Yakubu-led Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Nigeria Army of compromise in states where the governorship and state assembly elections were suspended or declared inconclusive. Its Spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan told a news conference that the electoral umpire and the Army were playing the script of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. Ologbondiyan alleged that elections were suspended or declared inconclusive in states where the PDP was maintaining a steady lead. Citing widespread disruptions, INEC, on Sunday, announced the suspension of electoral process in Rivers State and declared elections inconclusive in Sokoto, Bauchi, Adamawa, Plateau and Benue states. But the PDP described the affected states as its strongholds. It insisted that INEC, under Prof. Yakubu, “has become overtly partisan and has surrendered its independence to the APC.” The main opposition party said INEC carried on as a compromised umpire with obnoxious impunity, thereby sending signals of being heavily bribed by the APC to alter results for its candidates. It also accused the Army of intimidating its members in the affected states, particularly in Rivers, Akwa Ibom and other states in the Southsouth. The party dismissed claims by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, that the shootings and killings in those places were carried out by fake soldiers in military uniform.
