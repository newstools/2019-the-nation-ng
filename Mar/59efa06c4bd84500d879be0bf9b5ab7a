The police in Lagos have arrested a 33-year-old man, Olawale Aderibigbe, for allegedly using stolen Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards to loot victims’ accounts. Aderibigbe was arrested on Monday at Surulere, Lagos Mainland, where he went to withdraw money from a victim’s account, with a stolen ATM card. Parading the suspect at the command headquarters in Ikeja yesterday, Commissioner Zubairu Muazu said the police got credible intelligence in January on the activities of a criminal syndicate that specialised in robbing people of their ATM cards. He said Aderibigbe confessed to the crime, adding that efforts were on to arrest fleeing members of the syndicate. Explaining how he used his victims’ ATM cards to fleece them, he said he could transfer funds from any ATM once he has information about the card owner. He said: “I do not require pin to effect withdrawal of money from a victim’s account using his/her ATM card. All I need is to have any information about the victims and it is not difficult to get.”
