Girondins-Bordeaux of France winger, Samuel Kalu may not start against AS Monaco today, as his coach, Eric Bedouet fears he may not have recovered from his mother’s recent kidnap. Footballlive.ng can report that Bedouet is ready to play Kalu in the 8pm kick-off away fixture, but says he will not pressure the lad to play. Bedouet added that Kalu should be excused if he fails to click, as the lad had sleepless nights following the kidnap of his mother on February 27, and only came out of his shell when he got news of her release in the early hours of Monday, but it became public knowledge on Tuesday. The coach, though, is thinking big for the youngster and says he will not give Kalu a second straight match. He has played 29 matches for Bordeaux in all competitions so far this season, with four goals to show for his endeavour. Kalu had been left out of the squad that faced Montpellier in midweek, because he was not in the right frame of mind, but Bedouet said the former KAA Gent of Belgium lad will be in the team to Monaco. Bedouet affirmed: “Samuel Kalu is coming back, he is happy. But watch out, he spent nights not sleeping, with the phone next to him. “It’s complicated, but he come back to the group and we are happy that the outcome is favorable.”
