A group, the Third Force Movement, has called for electoral reforms that will make the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) efficient in election management. It suggested that INEC should be unbundled so that it should face pure electoral matters. The group said electoral offenders should be taken out of the electoral umpire’s responsibility. Addressing reporters in Lagos yesterday, the spokesman of the Movement,  Mr Wale Okunniyi, said direct appointment of INEC commissioners by the President should stop to guarantee the autonomy of the commission. To discourage those who have seen politics as an investment,  Okunniyi said political office should be part- time, adding that the perks of office should be drastically reduced. He said: “Salaries and allowances of political office holders and in the presidency and national assembly are humongous. There is a system of corruption planted in the constitution foisted on the nation by the military that must be tackled if we must succeed in fight against economic corruption. “ Okunniyi said the movement was not happy with the outcome of the general election. According to him, the election was characterised by falsification and manipulation of results. “We have started consultation with stakeholders like students, women and youths on how to forestall future occurrence of electoral malpractices in the country. We are doing this to correct the anomalies witnessed in this election and set a new agenda that will make it possible for Nigerians to exercise their franchise in future elections without fear.”
