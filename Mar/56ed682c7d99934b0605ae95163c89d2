Super Eagles’ Head Coach, Gernot Rohr has revealed that he will give a debut appearance to new invitee, Paul Onuachu against Seychelles and Egypt respectively, AOIFootball.com reports. After taking charge of its first training session on Tuesday evening, the Franco-German confirmed that the lanky forward will get at least 45 minutes or more and hopes to add another dimension to his forward line especially with the aerial strength of the FC Midtjylland forward. “We have possibilities to see everybody because we have two games. We will see several players. “And Paul Onuachu will play at least 45 minutes also or even more. We are searching for a player in his profile; tall, he is more than 2 meters high, good with the head. “We have (Odion) Ighalo already and we are very satisfied with what he is doing since the World Cup but with Paul Onuachu, perhaps, it’s another possibility to find a different profile. It could be interesting to see him playing together with Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Henry Onyekuru, and Moses Simon,” Rohr concluded. Onuachu caught the eye of Rohr with his scoring exploit in Denmark having netted 17 goals in all competitions for FC Midtjylland and will be the latest Eagle to get his debut under Rohr should he feature against Seychelles or Egypt in the coming days.
