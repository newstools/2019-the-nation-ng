Boko Haram insurgents have attacked Michika town in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State, razing the only commercial bank building in the town. The Nation gathered Tuesday morning that the insurgents got into the town about 7 pm Monday after overpowering the military formation in the town. Witnesses said the insurgents seized control of the town for a while, scaring hundreds of residents into surrounding bushes until soldiers arrived from Madagali following a reinforcement call from military authorities. Michika lies in the northern part of Adamawa State, an immediate neighbour to Madagali Local Government Area which was haunted by Boko Haram in the weeks and days to the February 16 and March 9 general elections. In the Monday attack on Michika, the insurgents bombed the Union Bank of Nigeria branch, the only banking facility in the town. Sources said the insurgents also burnt houses in Koppa village as they fled towards Sambisa with soldiers and mobilised local hunters on their trail. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, Othman Abubakar who confirmed the attack in a telephone interview with our correspondent Tuesday morning, said his information did not indicate any human casualty and that security agents had brought the situation under control.
