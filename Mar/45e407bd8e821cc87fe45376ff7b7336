No fewer than 100 women including widows from Ndiukwuenu community in Orumba North local government area of Anambra State, Friday, stormed the state police command, threatening to go nude over harassment by thugs and policemen in their area. Besides, they demanded immediate release of two of their husbands arrested by the police Friday morning in the community. The names of those arrested by the police on the orders of some land grabbers in the area were given as Raymond Egwu, a Catholic catechist and Vincent Nwafor. The women alleged they were tear-gassed by men of the state Criminal investigation Department CID, which allegedly made some of them pass out. But a senior police officer, who did not want his name mentioned, denied the allegation, adding that the women had fruitful discussion with the OC -CID. The senior officer assured the women that their husbands would be released immediately. However, addressing reporters at the CID gate in Amawbia, the leader of the protesting women, Dorothy Onyebarachi, said they no longer sleep with their two eyes closed on daily basis without one form of harassment from the police or thugs in the community. Also, the Secretary of the women group, Priscilla Okoli, told reporters that the women had decided to go nude round Awka and its environs, if such treatments were not stopped by government and the police in Ndiukwuenu. She said the people had forcefully taken their lands were they farm and feed their families, adding they come to the community to shoot sporadically every night to scare them and their families. Okoli said the Catechist of St Johnâ€™s Catholic Church Ozzuh was one of the persons arrested with no just cause, adding that the two persons terrorizing the community were doing it in connivance with the police.
