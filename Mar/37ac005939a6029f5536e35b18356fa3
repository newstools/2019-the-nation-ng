The Federal Government has resolved the brewing crisis threatening the implementation of the Digital Switch Over (DSO) from analogue television broadcasts in the country. The National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno, had on Thursday summoned the critical stakeholders in the DSO to a meeting where the contentious issues involved were discussed and resolved. The NSA had told the stakeholders the Federal Government was determined to uphold its policy on DSO and also ensuring that private investment in the Nigerian economy was not discouraged. The meeting, which lasted about three hours, witnessed the diplomatic negotiation and consensus building capacity of the NSA that facilitated a resolution of the five year old dispute, which interrupted smooth implementation of the DSO and twice led to missing set deadlines. The Federal Government policy on DSO was thereby protected from legal interpretation in law courts while also salvaging solid private investment in the nationâ€™s economy and attendant jobs created through the investment from uncertainty and jeopardy. At the meeting were Senator Elect and Chairman of the Board of NBC, Ikra Bilbis, DG NBC, Ishaq Modibbo Kawu, the CEO of Details Nigeria Limited, operators of Goth, John Ugbe and Chairman, Pinnacle Communications Limited, Sir Lucky Omoluwa whose efforts to make the meeting possible was acknowledged by the NSA, and COO of Pinnacle Communications Limited, Dipo Onifade.
