The Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) says the 78 accredited Computer Based Test (CBT) centres in Lagos are fully ready to conduct the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) starting from April 11. Mr. Babatunde Bamisaye, Coordinator JAMB Lagos office, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday. He spoke on the sideline of the matriculation of newly admitted students at the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka, Yaba, for the 2018/2019 academic session. According to him, as far as Lagos state is concerned, as at today, we have 78 accredited centres and all of them are fully ready with their personnel on ground. “The board had visited the centres and certified them technically fit to conduct the examination. “The Lagos office of the board had also been able to resolve complaints brought before it by intending candidates as the Servicom and Public Relations division of the board was dedicated to treat such cases. “We have been solving their problems and maybe one or two problems we are unable to solve locally, we refer it online to the head office for necessary attention,” he said. The coordinator, however, warned candidates not to attempt to bring items such as glasses, scientific wrist watches that were banned by the board to the examination premises, saying that they were unacceptable. “This is already a law pronounced by the JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is’haq Oloyede and anyone caught with such items will be sanctioned. “Except for special cases, such as recommended eye glasses proven beyond doubt that would be understandable,” he said. Bamisoye also advised parents to keep off the examination centres because their coming would add no value to the conduct of the examination, but may rather hinder its success. “What parents need to do is to get their children prepared, give them transport money and allow them to go and write their examination, after which they return home,” he said.
