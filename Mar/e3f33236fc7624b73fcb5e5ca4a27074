A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena has revealed plots by Senate President Bukola Saraki and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders to hijack leadership of the 9th session of the National Assembly. Nabena, in a statement in Abuja, said the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) must move fast to nip such moves in the bud by coming out with a zoning formula for the emergence of leaders of the legislature. Nabena, who is also the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said the Senate President is working in tandem with what he called “Otta farm”. He warned the APC must move quickly and urgently roll out the zoning arrangements to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2015. Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara emerged Senate President and Speaker against the party’s wish in the outgoing 8th National Assembly. Speaking with newsmen in Abuja, Nabena said the outgoing Senate President and his party (PDP) have devised plans to ensure that there loyalists take control of the legislative arm of government. He said: “The outgoing Senate President and the PDP caucus have begun surreptitious move to lure some new APC lawmakers with juicy committee position in return for their support for the PDP choice for the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives. “Already, Saraki’s henchman, Dino Melaye and some other returning PDP federal lawmakers have scheduled meetings with some APC lawmakers from Wednesday to Sunday in a yet-to-be announced venue.” He stressed: “It is important that the APC leadership meet and urgently rollout a fair zoning arrangement to ensure that we produce our preferred candidates for all leadership positions in the incoming National Assembly. “Since Saraki lost his bid to return to the Senate and control of his home state, Kwara, he has devised a plan to ensure that he influences the choice of the incoming National Assembly Leadership. This is Saraki’s last-ditch effort to remain politically relevant.”
