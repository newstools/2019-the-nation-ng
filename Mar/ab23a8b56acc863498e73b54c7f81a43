RESIDENTS of Satellite Town in Lagos yesterday, at a town hall meeting, tabled their wishlist before All Progressives Congress  (APC) governorship candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking their vote in the March 9 election. Sanwo-Olu promised them a better life, if elected. The residents, among others,  called for :  assistance on environmental issues; clearing of drainages blocked by tank farms blocked drainages. Oriade Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mrs. Ramota Eniola, who represented Sanwo-Olu, at the meeting, said the environmental problems  would soon be addressed. “We have been on this environmental issue for some time. We are going to solve the problem. We will present the issue to the next governor. We will work together to ensure things get done. The problems the residents are experiencing will be solved,” she said Satellite Town Forum Chairman Michael Imitini  said the meeting was to let Sanwo-Olu know that the area had been neglected for years. “We are Nigerians and we are supposed to be taken care of. We want the local government, the current governor, Akinwumi Ambode and Sanwo-Olu to know that this area has been neglected since 1999. “The issue of tank farm is one of our major problems, although it is being addressed gradually. Satellite Town is a residential area, but the government has established tank farms here. They want to bring in container terminal, which will also add to the problem we are facing. Our roads are  flooded whenever it rains  because of the poor drainage. The presence of trucks poses fire outbreak. The trucks also cause traffic jam. “We want the government to assist us by putting in place infrastructure such as good roads, drainage and electricity.”
