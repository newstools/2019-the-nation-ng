A 28-year-old man, Bashiru Ibrahim, who allegedly  killed another man by hitting his head on a stone, on Friday appeared before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Ibrahim, who resides at No. 16, Gbagbala St., Ikate Palace in Lagos State, was brought on a count charge of murder. His plea was, however, not taken. The Chief Magistrate, Mr O.O.
