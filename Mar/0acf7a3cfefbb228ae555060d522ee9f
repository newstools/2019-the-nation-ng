A 70-year-old man, Jeremiah Ikuonile, who stood  as surety for a defendant, was yesterday arraigned before an Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court for allegedly not producing him. The septuagenarian pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Adegeshin Famuyiwa told Magistrate E. O. Ogunkanmi that Ikuonile committed the offence on February 5. He alleged that Ikuonile stood as surety to Adebanjo Johnson, who was charged with domestic violence. The prosecutor said the surety was unable to provide Johnson when needed in court, in contravention of Section 97 (1) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The magistrate granted Ikuonile N100, 000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. He ordered that the sureties’ addresses be verified.  They are also to show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on March 21.
