THE Nigerian Communications Commission, (NCC) on Thursday said its research portfolio for research activities in the universities has reached over N252 .2 million. It said the fund was meant to promote technological innovation and boost local content in the information communication technology (ICT) and telecom industry. Its Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta dropped the hint while addressing Vice Chancellors of 61 universities at the Third Stakeholders Forum with Academia at the Transcorp Hotel, Abuja. Represented by the Director of New Media and Information Security, Eng.
