Old Mutual General Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Old Mutual Limited and Premium African Financial Services Group, has launched Double Awoof campaign on its Comprehensive Motor Insurance policy in furtherance of its resolve to deepen market penetration and reward its loyal customers, The company’s ‘Double Awoof’ loyalty programme, which began on August 27, 2019, will last till November 8, 2019. The loyalty programme rewards policyholders by slashing the cost of procuring comprehensive motor insurance cover to 2.5 per cent on vehicles and doubles the reward with an instant gift of a Total Service Station’s fuel voucher of up to N30,000. The Executive Head, Marketing, Old Mutual, Alero Ladipo, who made this known in a statement explained that for a vehicle owner whose car is valued at N2 million, the instant fuel voucher is N5,000 to keep the vehicle moving during the ember months. This, according to her, is an addition to the 25 per cent discount of the premium. She said: “The brand’s move to reward its growing customer base was borne out of the firm commitment to the Nigerian insurance market. We understand the importance of comprehensive car insurance to Nigerians especially during the last quarter of the year, when there is a spike in travel activities, heightened insecurity and other associated risks. “While we believe that it is critical for everyone to buy an insurance policy for their cars, we also consider it thoughtful to give back to policyholders who buy our Comprehensive Motor Insurance policy. So, it is really about buying a great product at a discount and getting rewarded at the same time,” she said.
