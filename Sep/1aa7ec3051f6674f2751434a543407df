According to him, “The three suspects will have their date in court soon. We do not want to state the woman’s name so as not to compromise investigation. “The Commission is resolute in exterminating cybercrime and bringing to book all those involved in this despicable activity. “As part of our strategic plans to tackle this malaise, the Benin Zonal Office, from January to date, through intelligence raided the hideout of internet fraudsters in our jurisdiction-Edo, Delta and Ondo States. “These raids led to the arrest of 113 internet fraudsters. While the prosecution of many of the cases is ongoing in court, we have so far secured 53 convictions in the period under review.” Over 30 exotic cars, charms, laptops, mobile phones, flash drives, according to him, were recovered from the suspects.
