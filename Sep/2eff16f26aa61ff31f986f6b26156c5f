Wife of Kebbi State governor, Hajia Aisha Atiku Bagudu, has said that the empowerment of the less-privileged in society and enrolment of children in schools will continue to be her priority in the state. Bagudu, who is the founder ofÂ  MALLPAi Foundation, stated this when she reached out to various Fulani groups at their RUGA settlement in the last couple of weeks. Bagudu, who flagged-off vaccination of animals against various animal diseases in the state, personally supervised the vaccination of cows in the Fulani settlement, stressing that one of the ways of improving the lives of the Fulani is by ensuring the good health of their animals. She also distributed mosquito nets, food items and other household materials to the people and presented tricycles, clutches and other visual aids to the disabled. Founded in 2009, the Mass Literacy for the Less Privileged and Almajiri Initiative (MALLPAi) was founded to render humanitarian services in almost all sectors of life such as health, education, agriculture and social life.
