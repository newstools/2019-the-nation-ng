Minister of Youth and Sport Development, Sunday Dare, has raised the alarm over the hack of his face book account. The hackers, he warned, have been impersonating him, soliciting for contracts from the federal government. Dare, in a statement by Director, Press & Public Relations Department in the Ministry, Lere- Adams, warned the general public to be wary of the activities of the hackers. According to him: “The attention of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, particularly the Honourable Minister, Mr Sunday Dare has been drawn to some mischievous scammers and fraudsters who specialise in hacking into social media platforms to perpetuate crime. “Information available to Management and the Honourable Minister, confirms that fraudsters have hacked into his face book account impersonating the Minister and soliciting for contracts from the Federal Government, this is totally false and misleading. “For the records, the Ministry and indeed the Honourable Minister wish to notify the general public to carefully verify all information emanating from the Minister’s social media platforms as these hackers are out to smear the image of Mr Sunday Dare, the Ministry and in effect the Federal Government of Nigeria.”
