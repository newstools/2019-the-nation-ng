Governor Dapo Abiodun has flagged off the Ogun State Anchor Borrowers’ Scheme, signalling the commencement of an agricultural revolution in the state. Speaking at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Abeokuta, the state capital, venue of the launch, Abiodun said that his government plans to turn the state into an agricultural hub, capable of feeding itself and other states in the country. He said the Anchor Borrowers’ Scheme was another avenue to boost the nation’s self-sufficiency in food production, which is line with the federal government’s agenda on food security to save foreign exchange spent annually on importation of food items that could be produced locally. The governor also said that the scheme would help in creating employment opportunities for farmers, women and the youths in the state. Already, about 2000 beneficiaries have been selected and would be given certificates of acceptance and leasehold, according to the governor. He expressed surprise that despite the success of the scheme in other states, Ogun State did not take full advantage of funds availability in the scheme to help farmers improve their production. According to the governor, the scheme was a tripartite agreement between the state as facilitator, Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, as financier and the beneficiaries, even as he called on the recipients to be committed and responsible in their repayment plan. Abiodun assured that beneficiaries of the scheme would be given one hectare of land free. “We will also provide clearing, seedlings, fertilizers, extension services and we will pay upkeep allowances until the first harvest,” he added.
