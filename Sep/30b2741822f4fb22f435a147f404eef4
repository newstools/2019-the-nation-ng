PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari’s planned visit to South Africa next month remains on course to reinforce “the strong bonds between the two countries” and jointly develop responses to problems affecting people and businesses in South Africa and Nigeria, the presidency said on Saturday. In the wake of public violence in South Africa and developments in Nigeria around South African businesses based in the West African country, President Cyril Ramaphosa held discussions on Friday with Nigerian Ambassador Ahmed Rufai Abubakar, Buhari’s special envoy, the presidency said in a statement.

Buhari conveyed his commitment to the values of prosperity and the advancement of Africa that were shared by South Africa and Nigeria. Nigeria stood ready to assist South Africa in establishing the root causes of and developing sustainable solutions to the problems concerned.
