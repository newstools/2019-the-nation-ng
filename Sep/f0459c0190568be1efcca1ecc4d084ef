Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has assured that kidnappers of the Chief Medical Director (CMD), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Prof. Sylvanus Okogbenin, would soon be captured. Prof. Okogbenin was abducted by gunmen at Ramat Park in Benin City while on his way to Benin Airport en route from Abuja. He spent seven days before he was released on September 4. Governor Obaseki said the state government would compensate the families of two police officers killed during the kidnap. The two officers, Sergeants Odion Jonathan Ajibola and Etinosa Erhuegbea, were orderlies of Prof. Okogbenin. Obaseki made the pledge when he visited the CMD at his residence in Ekpoma, Esan West Local Government Area of the state, adding that the compensation would come under the Edo State Government’s Insurance Scheme for the state security architecture codenamed, ‘Wabaizigan’. The governor said he would visit families of the deceased police officers and make adequate arrangements to ensure they are captured in the insurance scheme. He said security agencies were on the trail of the abductors having obtained useful information on their activities. Prof Okogbenin commended the state government, security agencies and the hospital community for their role in his rescue, adding that their support was helping him recover from the trauma.
