An Ilorin, Kwara State High Court on Thursday sentenced internet fraudster Stephen Olarewaju Odanye to six months imprisonment. The 35 years old Odanye had earlier pleaded guilty to the one count charge preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The charge reads: “That you, Stephen Olarewaju Odanye (a.k.a Raymond Sullivan) sometime in September 2019 or thereabout at Ilorin,  Kwara State within the jurisdiction of this honourable court attempted to commit an offence of cheating by pretending and presenting yourself to one Lynn Smith,  to be a white man,  supplier of Engineering and Construction equipment,  living in Washington as it is contained in your email gmail account: raysulivan@yahoo.com and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 95 and 321 of the penal code law and punishable under section 322 of the same act.” Delivering his judgement, Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar said that “the defendant was arraigned on one count charge of attempt to commit an offence of cheating by pretending and representing one Lynn Smith, an offence contrary to section 95 of the penal Code Law. “The prosecution called one witness, Olamide Sadiq, an operative of EFCC who narrated to this honourable Court of how the defendant was arrested and items recovered from his laptop computer.” Justice Abdulgafar added that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt as the evidence of the sole witness was not challenged. “I found you Stephen Olarewaju Odanye guilty of one count charge of attempt to cheat by impersonation and hereby sentence you to six months imprisonment without an option of fine,” he said. He directed that the convict’s laptop and mobile phones of the convict be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria.
