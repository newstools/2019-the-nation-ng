Satellite is another infrastructure that can help speed up the Federal  Government’s broadband ambition because of its ability to reach the rural areas. Incidentally, the country has a satellite, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NigComSat), which could help bridge the gap. NigComSat said it has taken a new approach to the delivery of satellite connectivity solutions by establishing an eco-system of Virtual Internet Service Providers (VISPs) which will operate using the digital  Business Support System (BSS) PortaBilling, provided by PortaOne. This will  deliver the service to key markets – such as government, defence, maritime and enterprise. VISPs will rent data channels from the NigComSat orbiting satellite and then rely on the PortaBilling self-care portal to manage their tariff plans and subscribers. PortaBilling will carry out all service monetisation, ie: service activation, charging, invoicing and payment collection. So, a VISP does not need to purchase or implement any infrastructure, and the only action required on the VISP side is to install the customer’s equipment. The low entry barrier enables nearly local firms, such as system integrator, utility or even a supermarket chain to become an internet service provider (ISP). It will have major effects in several key markets, in particular for small office or home office (SOHO) that will benefit from better satellite connectivity. The Managing Director/CEO, NigComSat, Dr Abimbola Alale, said PortaBilling, a robust and flexible solution, will address the common challenges ISPs face in the country. She said: “It will also aid profitability, market readiness and a need for technology, which evolves with the market because PortaOne offers a license, unlimited in terms of number of subscribers or resellers. This helps to maintain a low and predictable  Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).” She expressed gratitude to PortaOne team’s agile development work done on the project to integrate with other elements of the solution such as online payment through REMITA. Based in Canada, PortaOne is a leading software developer of service provisioning and billing systems for modern telecommunication companies – across the globe. The CEO of PortaOne, Andriy Zhylenko, said flexible convergent digital BSS is a crucial tool which will enable NigComSat to succeed via monetisation of an innovative service and better customer experience. “At the heart of PortaBilling is an open architecture that will integrate seamlessly with NigComSat’s value-added services. The two will work smoothly together to create cutting edge solutions that will meet the needs of today’s customers,” Zhylenko said. He said PortaBilling will make internet access more abundant and affordable by building a vast network of VISPs in the country. PortaBilling would further enable prepaid satellite internet access across the country by improving revenue collection and reduction of leakage for VISPs and NigComSat. Zhylenko said: “Since the entry is simplified and the operating costs are minimal due to fully automated service provisioning and charging, new ISPs will be able to appear in regions where they did not exist before. As a result, the overall end-user experience will be improved and there will be more healthy competition.” The Executive Director, Technical Services at NigComSat, Kazeem Raji, expressed satisfaction with the full open architecture of PortaBilling, which enables the firm to tie it into various back-office and VAS system. “A true partnership approach where we are empowered to decide on how and who performs the integration within our system,” he said.
