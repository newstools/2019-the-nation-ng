Management of the Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, has denied reports that it has shut down the institution due to cult -related killings. About five persons have been killed in a cult war that began last weekend. Spokesman for the institution, Musa Oshiobugie, statement said students are only on vacation. Oshiobugie said the reported cult killings and violence happened at Iyakpi, a community that is two kilometres away from Auchi. He said no student of the institution has been killed or injured in the violence. According to the statement, “The polytechnic has been on holidays for the past one week when the students finished with their examinations and the hostels were vacated. “A school already on holiday cannot be shut. What appears to drive this rumour is a reported violent incident that occurred in Iyakpi, a town two kilometres from Auchi. “Preliminary reports show that no student of the polytechnic is among the reportedly dead.”
