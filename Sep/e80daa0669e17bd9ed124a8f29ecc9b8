Nigerian striker, Peter Olayinka had a memorable outing in the prestigious UEFA Champions League last night after scoring what was his debut goal in the tournament for Slavia Prague in their 1-1 draw against Inter Milan at the Giuseppe Meazza. The 36 Lion FC Football Academy product who almost became the first foreigner to play for the Albania national football team scored in the 63rd minute of the game to give his Czech Republic side a famous lead. Olayinka was the quickest to react on a loose ball and put it away after Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic had made a superb low stop to deny substitute Jaroslav Zeleny. Slavia looked to be on course for only their second ever Champions League win, until Barella found the far corner in the 92nd minute to equalise for Inter, after Stefano Sensi’s free-kick had come back off the crossbar.

He received medical attention on the field and had to be taken off to get more treatment before coming back to play for two more minutes. As a precautionary move, Slavia Prague manager Jindrich Trpisovsky pulled out Olayinka in the 85th minute and replaced him with Czech Republic forward, Lukas Provod. Meanwhile, Victor Osimhen fired blank as Lille fell 0-3 to Ajax in Holland. The Nigerian striker who has been in hot form for club and country could not rescue his French side in the debut season in the UEFA Champions League. However, Osimhen had a great chance to score in the 45th minute but his volleyed effort fails to hit the target. Ajax goals were scored by Quincy Promes in the 18th through a header, Edson Alvarez double the lead in the 50th minute, while Nicolas Tagliafico put a gloss on the scoreline with another goal in the 62nd minute.
