Snoring is a common occurrence, which is normal for most people. This is because the throat muscles relax as one gets older. Although snoring is usually not very serious and is mostly just a nuisance for your bed partner, if you are a habitual snorer, you don’t only disrupt the sleep patterns of those close to you, but you also impair your own sleep. It is also important to know that snoring may be a potential health issue if the snorer experiences any of the following symptoms: · Excessive daytime drowsiness, or waking up not feeling rested · Morning headaches · Recent weight gain · High blood pressure · Chest pain at night · Decreased ability to concentrate or memory loss · Observed pauses in breathing at night · Waking up gasping for breath · Long interruptions of breathing (more than 10 seconds) · Frequent waking from sleep · Poor night’s sleep. · Daytime sleepiness and fatigue.  https://www.sciencedaily.com
