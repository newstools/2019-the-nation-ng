Cindy has emerged as the new head of house after winning the Monday challenge. The challenge required the housemates throwing balls into a pot hole created by Big Brother. However, the twist to the game was that the housemate with the highest amount of balls hanging to on would either win or move to the next round. Frodd, Diane, Cindy, and Mercy advanced to the next round, after succeeding in the first round. Housemates were instructed to fill a test tube to the brim in the second round using a teaspoon using just one hand. Big  Brother instructed that each housemate should indicate when they are done filling the test tubes. After two intense minutes, Cindy won, and she automatically becomes head of house. She has thus won 250 bet9ja coins, immunity for the week, and exclusive access to the ‘Head Of House’ room. When asked to pick one of the housemates to enjoy the ‘Head Of House’ room, Cindy surprisingly picked Mike.
