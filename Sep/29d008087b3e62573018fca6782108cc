The new District Governor of Lions Club District 404B1, Bernard Oziegbe Eboreime has said the club will build a diabetes centre in Alimosho General Hospital, Ijegun Lagos. He made this known during his public presentation as the district governor of the club for 2019-2020, as well as fund-raise to help achieve the project. The event was held at Ikeja, Lagos. In attendance were the Ogun State Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako-Oyedele and the Secretary to Edo state Government, Osarodion Ogie, among others. Eboreime said the diabetes centre will cost N82m including equipment, adding that the project will be completed in a year and handed over to the people of Alimosho Local Government. “My priority is to build a diabetes centre for the people of Alimosho Local Government which is one of the biggest in Lagos State.” The immediate past District Governor, Lekan Babalola said, “I believe so much in the new district governor and I believe he will do better than me. For my own tenure, I will call it a successful tenure because we were able to achieve a lot. We were able to donate N400, 000 to children suffering from cancer at LUTH. We were able to feed a lot of people and also educate the people on how to take good care of their environment.”
