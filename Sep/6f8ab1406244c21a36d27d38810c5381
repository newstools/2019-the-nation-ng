The Interior Minister, Ambrose Dery has directed the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) to arm police officers on traffic duty. He said James Oppong Boanuh should provide the officers with bullet-proof vests and helmets to enable them “exercise their right to self-defence effectively when they meet such callous and barbaric persons”. Five police officers have been killed in the line of duty within the last 30 days. Many security experts have attributed it to the lack of logistics for police personnel who ensure law and order in the country. The latest is the gory killing of two policemen by some armed robbers this week. This was after the officers tried to stop them at a checkpoint at Buduburam in the Central region.
