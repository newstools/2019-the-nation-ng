A student of the Moshood Abiola Polytechni, Samuel Ogunyinka, has been awarded a plot of land by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of JawJaw Africa, Victor Eniola-Mark. Ogunyinka, popularly called Pharmist stunned the audience as he did justice to the theme: “Nigeria: Which way my country” at the second public speaking competition organised by the Association of Mass Communication Student (AMACOS) of MAPOLY. Impressed by Ogunyinka’s oratorial prowess, Eniola-Mark, who was the chief judge at the contest, gave a plot of land to Ogunyinka after his performance. “I wasn’t expecting that someone will come out and say because of what you have done, you’ll be awarded a land, it was a surprise,” Ogunyinka said, thanking the donor for his gesture. Ogunyinka continued: “I was surprised he called me over there. “No matter what people say about you, you should be able to inspire yourself. “My advice to others is that they should not look down on themselves, picture where you are going and make sure you get there. No matter how tough and rough the road maybe, there will surely be the destination.”
