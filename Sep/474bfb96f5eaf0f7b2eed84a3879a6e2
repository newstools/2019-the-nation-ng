ODUNAYO Adekuoroye is known globally as the ‘Dancing Queen’ for her trademark dance steps after major victories. And when she burst into the same dance steps after beating Moldova’s Anastasia Nichita to claim bronze at the world championship in Kazakhstan, fans at Barys Arena had no choice but to applaud the Nigerian prodigy. After missing the race for the gold medal following the 1-6 loss to Japan’s Risako Kawai, Adekuoroye moved straight for her opponent’s jugular to win the fight 10-0 in two minutes and affirm her status as one of the world best in the women’s 57kg of freestyle event. Adekuoroye displayed exceptional skill to confuse most of her opponents who had no answer to the Nigerian superior fighting style. And against Nichita she was ahead 2-0 inside 20 seconds and secured the win with a good rollover which prompted the referee to award her the match with a 10-0 win in less than two minutes. This is Adekuoroye’s third World Championship medal after winning bronze in 2015 and silver in 2017 in United States and France respectively. Blessing Oborududu is in race for a place at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in the 68kg of freestyle  event after starting her campaign well against Italy’s Dalma Caneva with a 10-0 win. But she lost to eventual finalist, United States’ Tamyra Mensah 12-1. President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) Daniel Igali confirmed to NationSport that Oborududu would be fighting in one of the Repechage (qualifying) bouts with winners joining the list of qualifiers for Tokyo 2020. In today’s bout, Oborududu will take on New Zealand’s Michelle Montague on Mat A. But the second round loss by Aminat Adeniyi ended her dream of fighting for Olympics slot with her conqueror; Ukraine’s Yulia Ostaphchuk was beaten in the quarterfinal by eventual finalist, Kyrgyzstan’s Aisuluu Tynybekova.
