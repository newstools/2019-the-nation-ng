The Police in Imo State have arrested a couple and four others for stealing and selling two siblings for N900,000. Commissioner of Police Rabiu Ladodo said one of the stolen children, Promise Opunwa,2, has been recovered. He however said his elder sister, Olunma,4, was still missing.
Parading the suspects before newsmen, Ladodo who gave the names of the couple as Chika Obi,28 and Chiamaka, described the deal as absurd, saying that the infant was recovered at Uli in Anambra State. He said other members of the syndicate include Ogidi Chukwuma,26, Anuforo Ogechi,28,Ebere Okafor,45, and Chioma Ngobiri, 46. “On August 4, three members of the syndicate invaded the house of one Ijeoma Opunwa and inflicted machete cut on one Daberechi Okafor who was present at the time of the invasion. “They instilled fear on other occupants and made away with two children, Oluma ,4, and Promise, 2, to an unknown destination. They robbed them their phone and undisclosed amount of money.” On receipt of the information, the CP said that the operatives of the anti-kidnapping unit stormed the hoodlums’ hideout at Umulololo Okigwe LGA where Ogechi Anuruo, Chika Obi, and Chiamaka Nwadinobi were apprehended. According to him: “The suspects confessed to the crime and even led operatives to Onitsha through Uli in Anambra State where their gang members one Ebere Okafor and Chioma Ngobiri were arrested and one of the stolen children, Promise ,2, was recovered.” Ladodo assured that efforts were on top gear to rescuing the remaining missing child. One of the suspects, Ogidi, he said admitted that he got N130, 000 from the shady transaction.
