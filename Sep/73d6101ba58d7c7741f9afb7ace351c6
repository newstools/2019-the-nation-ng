Lagos State Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle has said the vision of the government for a 21st century economy can only be achieved with a dedicated 21st century compliant workforce. Ponnle, who spoke at the weekend at her maiden meeting with agencies, departments and units in the ministry comprising Office of Establishments and Training, Civil Service Pensions Office, Lagos State Pensions Commission and Public Service Staff Development Centre, Magodo, said it was imperative for the agencies and workers to be prepared to complement the vision of the government in its quest to achieve a greater Lagos. Ponnle added: “The mandate of the ministry must be collectively pursued.” She urged officials of the ministry and agencies to shun unhealthy rivalry, stressing that the ministry can only be adjudged to be successful when the agencies under its supervision excel. The commissioner said plans were being made to organise a retreat for the officials of the agencies, to synergise, strategise and devise methods of meeting the needs of the citizens and also to surmount the challenges that lie ahead. She craved the support of the workers in the areas of sense of duty, collective ownership, dedication to duty and sense of purpose. “Let me assure you that the commitment of the present administration under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to human capital development, career management, institutional policy reforms, pension matters and maintenance of harmonious industrial climate cannot be underestimated,” Ponnle said.
