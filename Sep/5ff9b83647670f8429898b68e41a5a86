Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has praised the Federal Government for constituting the Economic Advisory Council. Its Director-General, Mr. Timothy Olawale, lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for overhauling the management of the economy. He described the composition of the council as very robust, with seasoned professionals with expertise in areas, such as fiscal policy, monetary, industrial policy, trade and energy economics. He said: “At a time like this, the country needs to fight head on the ills of poverty, unemployment and achieve significant economic growth. As a nation, we have never been short of ideas or policies. The crux is necessary reforms and implementations of the policies in the country, especially in creating enabling environment for businesses to thrive and contribute their quota to National Development through job creation, among others. “With the council reporting directly to Mr. President, this will allow them (the Council) to focus on execution and achievement of targets set by the Presidency”. However, Olawale said in previous administrations, the Economic Advisory Council of this type usually had consultations regularly with the Organised Private Sector in Nigeria (OPSN) on sectoral issues. “We will implore this Council to embrace the consultative fellowship in achieving the desired goal of economic development,” he said. Olawale called on the government and Nigerians to give the council the needed support to effectively deliver on the assignment.
