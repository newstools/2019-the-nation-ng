But Ajayi, who thanked God that no life was lost in the flood, advised that people still living in the affected buildings to vacate them to prevent disasters. The acting governor promised that the government would try its best in bringing relief to the affected victims soon. “We thank God no life was lost. Small flood that is not much like this had killed. But we thank God such did not happen in Idanre. “I was in Ibadan when this happened. We have inspected the houses; I will advise that our people should leave the affected houses to prevent another disaster. “Some people build houses along the river course. We will ensure that no matter how highly placed the person is, we will demolish the house to have a free flow of water,” he said. Ajayi also promised that amphibious excavator would be deployed to the town to help channel the waterways.
