SUPER Eagles forward, Henry Onyekuru is expected back in the national team in November after processing his work permit with the French authorities. The attacker who was dropped from the 23-man list for the international friendly against Brazil is yet to get his work permit since arriving French Ligue 1 side, Monaco two months ago. He also missed this month’s friendly against Ukraine for the same reason. “Honestly, it hasn’t been easy for me here, you know I only recently returned from a small knock and the paper issues have also not been settled. “The way things are done here in Monaco is quite different and in fact I just got my account sorted out this week despite arriving almost two months ago,” Onyekuru revealed,” he told AOIFootball.com. He remains optimistic of returning to the team in November for the 2021 AFCON qualifying match against Benin Republic.
