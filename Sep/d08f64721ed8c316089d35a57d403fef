The House of Representatives has mandated its Committees on Health Institution and Healthcare Services to carry out holistic review of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). The lawmakers explained that “this is to encourage more participation by Nigerians with a view to attaining the Universal Health Coverage for Nigerians”. They also urged the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to direct all Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) to pay, within three months, all outstanding debts owed healthcare providers across the country. The lawmakers enjoined the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) to ensure that private medical practitioners register their clinics with the NHIS as accredited health providers of medical services. This followed a motion by Valentine Ayika and six other lawmakers, titled: “Failure of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to Function Optimally.” The lawmaker noted that the NHIS was established by an Act of the National Assembly to ensure that every Nigerian has access to quality and affordable healthcare service through the provision of affordable health insurance. “…The scheme has a presidential mandate to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2015 but has failed in that regard, as available information shows that it currently boasts a little over six million enrolees, despite regular budgetary allocations. “Also, …50 per cent of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, which represents one per cent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the government available for the scheme, part of which was released in May 2019; yet, the scheme still fell short of its targeted objectives,” he said. The committees are to report back within six weeks for further legislative action.
