Bayelsa Speaker Emmanuel Tonye Isenah may resign on Monday following pressure mounted on him by some Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders to quit his position ahead of the November 16th governorship election. A source, who spoke on the development, said Isenah decided to resign so that he won’t be blamed in case the PDP fails to win the election. The source, who spoke in confidence, said: “Isenah hinted of his resignation while addressing staff of the Assembly after presiding over plenary on Friday. “Members of the House that witnessed the Speaker’s briefing were Felix Bonny Ayah, representing Southern Ijaw Constituency 1, and Moses Marlon, representing Southern Ijaw Constituency 3.” Isenah came under intense pressure to relinquish his office in the House of Assembly to enable his party balance political equations ahead of the November 16 governorship election. The Speaker was said to have reached an agreement with Dickson and other PDP leaders to vacate his office in the event that Senator Douye Diri, who hails from his Kolokuma-Opokuma Local Government Area, emerged the candidate of the PDP for the election. Following the emergence of Diri, PDP leaders were said to have asked Isenah to surrender his position to another lawmaker from Southern Ijaw to enable the party garner votes from the council. But Isenah initially insisted that he would not let go of his position before the governorship poll, adding that he was yet to see how abandoning his office would the PDP win the coming poll.
