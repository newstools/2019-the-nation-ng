Wider adoption of voluntary sustainability standards could catalyse progress towards the global goals, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has said. Like most things with a stamp of approval, goods and services that enjoy sustainability certification are landing more in the consumer basket, helping traders and consumers care for the environment and make more sustainable choices, it said in a statement. These labels and the standards behind them that guarantee that the products you buy do not hurt the environment and the people who make them, can unlock new markets for developing countries, participants at the second International Convention on Sustainable Trade and Standards (ICSTS) heard. These sustainability standards can support trade and spur economic growth, while promoting environmental protection and inclusive social development, said UNCTAD’s Santiago Fernández-de-Córdoba, coordinator of the United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS). UNFSS is an inter-agency platform that provides information and analysis on voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) and facilitates discussions about them at the intergovernmental level.
