The federal government has offered explanations on why it recalled the High Commissioner to South Africa, Ambassador Kabiru Bala. Bala was recalled on Wednesday following the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and their businesses as well as residences in South Africa. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, however explained Bala was recalled only for consultation. The consultation will hold after the return of the Special Envoy sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. He said: “The Nigerian government is only recalling the country’s High Commissioner in South Africa for consultation and that will be after the President’s Special Envoy has returned from South Africa.”
