Three men suspected to be “one chance“ operators were burnt to death around Dutse in Abuja on Monday morning. “One chance” operators are people who pretend to be commercial drivers and carry unsuspecting victims to be robbed or killed for ritual purposes. The Nation gathered from an eyewitness that the three men who were in a vehicle had carried a young woman who raised alarm and attracted the attention of people around who managed to accost the vehicle. Thereafter an angry mob rescued the lady and set the three men as well as the vehicle ablaze. Federal Capital Territory Police Public Officer, DSP Manzah Ajuguri condemned the action, saying an investigation has been launched into the matter. “We condemn jungle justice. We condemn the act of people taking the law into their hands. If there is a crime we expect our attention to be drawn so that arrests are made, “he said. He didn’t say if any arrest had been made but stressed that investigation has commenced into incident.
