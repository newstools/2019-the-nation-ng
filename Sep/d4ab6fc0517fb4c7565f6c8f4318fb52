Fela Anikulapo Kuti, a musician and multi-instrumentalist, was born to Reverend Oludotun and Mrs. Funmilayo Ransome Kuti in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on October 15, 1938. He used his music to address societal ills and was a victim of oppression by the military regime who harassed him frequently and jailed him many times. Seeking emancipation of the Black Race, Fela canvassed a better social, economic and political future for Africa. He died on August 2, 1997 in Lagos from HIV complications as announced by his late elder brother and former Minister of Health, Dr. Olikoye Ransome Kuti. Felabration was founded by his daughter, Yeni Kuti, as an annual festival to honour the ideals that Fela stood for.
