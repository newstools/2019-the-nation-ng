The police in Lagos have arrested four suspected armed robbers alleged to have terrorised residents of Igando. The suspects were arrested at Egan following a manhunt for them by detectives led by Igando Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Taiwo Kasumu. It was gathered that one of the suspects identified as Oseni Waheed, 32, was first apprehended on Saturday and a locally made gun recovered from him. The suspects were said to have attacked their victims on Saturday night along Ikotun-Igando road when police received tip off from some residents. They were said to have operated on a motorcycle and upon sighting the police, they fled but Oseni was caught. It was gathered that his confession led to the raid of the suspectsâ€™ hideout at Aribisala Street in Egan where the other three were picked up around 2:30am Sunday. A source who hinted on the arrest said the suspects were being interrogated and would be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) Panti.
