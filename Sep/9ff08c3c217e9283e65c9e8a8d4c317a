The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has assured of fruitful reconciliatory efforts at uniting aggrieved members following the fallout of the party’s September 3 primary elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. The outcome of the primaries had sparked disagreement within the ranks of aspirants and their supporters in the two states, with fears of mass defection threatening the unity and cohesion of the party ahead of the November 16 elections. The PDP however said the party is poised for “sweeping victory” in the elections, stressing that its grassroots structures have been activated in the two states ahead of the elections. In a statement on Tuesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party states that its members and supporters have nothing to fear as reconciliatory efforts in the aftermath of the governorship primary elections in the two states were yielding immense results and further strengthening its structures and formations as one big, united and formidable family. It further assured that it’s leaving no stone unturned to ensure that all aggrieved members are appeased so that the party could face the elections as a family. The PDP commended what it described as the understanding and the spirit of sportsmanship being exhibited by critical stakeholders in the two states as well as their commitment towards the success of the party at the elections. It added that it has already galvanized all segments of the voting population across the two states, boasting that the two states remained are known to be strongholds of the PDP. The party boasted that no force, not even the All Progressives Congress (APC) can stop the victory of its candidates in the two states.
