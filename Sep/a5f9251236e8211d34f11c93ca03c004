Otunfodunrin and Oguntola were appointed Editorial advisers by UCJ, in recognition of their journalistic acumen, while Olorunyomi who was represented by Ben Ezemalu, was installed the Grand Patron of the association. UCJ President Martins Isaac hopes the installation would inspire the trio, to further champion the cause of UCJ in terms of grooming campus Journalists for better performance. The high point of the event was the induction of over 100 campus journalists into UCJ. Charging the 164 campus journalists-inductees, Isaac urged them to be steadfast in their pursuit of news story and be critical in their write-ups. “With the installation of the two editorial advisers and the grand patron with sterling profiles in the media space, it’s our belief that they will help expand the frontiers of excellence in UCJ UI,” he said, Pioneer UCJ UI President Dr. Bayo Ajala, who decorated the editorial advisers, expressed his utmost delight with what the union has recorded so far. He noted that most of the special posts and honor currently in existence weren’t in use at the time of his membership. Otunfodunrin and Oguntola thanked the union for the honour conferred on them. Oguntola promised to help UCJ members grow in the profession.
