The joy of every father is to see their children thriving excellently in their endeavours; most especially when a business empire is involved. Kabir Jibola Gbemisola, is one child his father, late Alhaji Fatai Gbemisola, would forever be proud of. With his wealth of knowledge, he infused impeccable ideas and uncommon business finesse that helped repositioned his late father’s business empire. Jibola Fatgbems, as he is fondly called by friends, is far from being a spoilt child, who solely depend on their fathers wealth and deep pocket. He is working assiduously to reposition and sustain his late father’s company, Fatgbems Petroleum to an enviable height. Ever since the former CEO of Spirsal Oil and Gas, took over the affairs of the company in 2013, alongside his two brothers, Hassan and Bayo Gbemisola, it has witnessed tremendous change, driven by lofty ideas; thereby attracting global attention. Despite the dwindling price in world oil, the company is conveniently competing as a top player in the oil and gas business. However, in spite of his status and achievements, the graduate of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Oyo State, is living a modest lifestyle. If there is one thing he learnt from his late father that would be philanthropy and cheerful giving. He is generous to a fault. In a bid to keep spreading the company’s wing high flying, the stylish Ogun State-born businessman has recently added a brand new state-of-the art ultra -modern mega gas station, strategically located on IBB Boulevard, road, Abeokuta, Ogun state. The addition of the new mega station has further showed that Jibola and his team are not relenting on their way to the top.
