FORMER Green Eagles’ goalkeeper, Peter Fregene is recuperating at the Intensive Care Unit of the Reddington Hospital after undergoing two major successful surgeries. About three months ago, Tina, wife of the former goalkeeper who won the Nigeria FA Cup with both ECN and Stationery Stores, cried out for a lifeline for her ailing husband. Contrary to the widely held opinion that the former shot-stopper suffered from stroke, his wife said it was discovered that he had paralysis as a result of a spinal cord injury. Fregene had battled this ailment for 18 years before billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola came to his rescue and offered to pick up his medical bills after Tina’s passionate appeal to Nigerians to save the life of her husband. Last Wednesday, two major operations were performed on Fregene at the Reddington Hospital Victoria Island Lagos by one of the Best Neurosurgeons in the World, the United States-based Dr Olawale Sulaiman. Otedola flew in Dr Sulaiman into the country from the United States, to perform the surgery on Fregene who had been bedridden for three years. Before Otedola’s lifeline, the 71-year-old former Nigeria International moved only on his buttocks or was supported to move around his house, a routine which drained his energy and that of his ageing wife. Former Lagos state governor, Babatunde Fashola took Reneger to Lagos where he had an operation some years ago but further treatment was discontinued due to lack of funds. Similarly, the former Delta state governor, James Ibori, also funded his treatment at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) during his tenure. Apart from these, no further help came the way of the septuagenarian former footballer. The Delta state-born footballer was a member of the Nigerian team that participated at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City and two years after Fregene broke into the Green Eagles squad.
