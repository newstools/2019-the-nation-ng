The leadership of the Abia State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Chief Uchenna Obigwe has visited the management of the Abia State Polytechnic Aba as one of the steps to address the labour crisis in the institution. Sources in the State Chapter of the NLC told our reporter that the meeting however, couldn’t hold as the Rector of the state institution had asked that the polytechnic’s chapter chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics (SSANIP), Comrade Nwachukwu Chuks should leave the institution’s Council Chamber, because, according to the Rector (Prof. Ezionye Eboh), Chuks who was among the sacked 258 workers is no longer a staff of the institution. The sources went further to state that the NLC delegation’s attempt to convince the rector that there was nothing wrong with Chuks’s presence in the meeting failed on deaf ears, as Eboh maintained that Chuks is a strange element in the meeting. Addressing members of staffers of the institution in front of the school’s administrative block after the walkout, chairman of NLC Abia State; Comrade Uchenna Obigwe said that the 14 days ultimatum given to the management of the school by SAANIP and NASU (Non-Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics), Abia Polytechnic chapter to meet the demands of the unions still subsists.
