Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen scored his fifth goal of the season for his new club Lille in their 2-1 victory over Angers in a Ligue 1 game played on Friday. The win moved Lille to joint second on the table behind French champions Paris Saint-Germain with three wins out of five matches. Osimhen was recently named Lilleâ€™s Player of the Month for August after a brilliant start to life in France. The 20-year-old striker scored his first goal for the Super Eagles in the recent 2-2 draw with Ukraine. Osimhen has scored two braces for Lille since he joined from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi in the summer. He scored his first brace on his debut for Lille in a 2-1 win over Nantes in their first Ligue 1 game of the season. He netted another brace for his team in their 3-0 league win over Saint Etienne.
