Pride and honour will be at play in the forthcoming October 13th international friendly match between Nigeria and Brazil and expectedly no quarter would be asked and none would be given. This much is the verdict of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, as the countdown to this important game begins in earnest even as he called on the Super Eagles to pay serious attention to what can be considered a titanic battle. Speaking in Abuja at the weekend, Dare said though the match is friendly, it should be used to expose the strengths and weaknesses of the team ahead of future competitive matches. He opined that matches involving the  Super Eagles should be given adequate attention by coach Gernot Rohr- led  technical crew , adding  top Grade A international friendly matches against teams  like Brazil  would boost the team’s status in the monthly rankings by the world football governing body, FIFA. “I look forward to a very entertaining and interesting match,” declared Dare. “Brazil, as we all know, is among the top five best footballing nations in the world and Nigeria is known in Africa. “I think the Super Eagles have ego to play for even though it’s a friendly game. “Brazil and Nigeria will be world attraction because the two nations are good in the round leather game with arrays of professional players plying their trade outside their domestic leagues,” he noted. Meanwhile, the Minister refused to predict the outcome of the match, adding that the Super Eagles with talents at the disposal of Coach Rohr should give Brazil a run for their money. He expressed readiness to grace the match venue for the international friendly in Singapore, saying it   would afford him the opportunity to meet and interact with the senior national team players for the first time since he assumed office.
