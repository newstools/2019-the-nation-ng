 Business minded Super Eagles midfielder Wilfred Ndidi shot his Leicester City side into the lead in the 26th minute against Spurs on Saturday but had the goal cancelled by VAR. The Video Assistant Referee had ruled that the Nigerian international was off side and as such the goal could not hold.  Ndidi was however not the only one that jubilated first for scoring  and disappointed  later as Tottenham’s Serge Aurier equally suffered the same fate in the 67th minute when he grabbed what should have been the visitors second goal after red hot Harry Kane had scored  the first  in the 29th minute . Gingered by Kane’s goal Spurs maintained a very strong momentum and looked like they were bent on running away with an away victory. Ricardo Pereira however leveled up for Leicester City in the 69th minute just two minutes after Serge Aurier’s goal was annulled by the VAR. A rejuvenated Leicester City then consolidated with James Maddison getting a second goal in the 85th minute and the Foxes put up a good show to maintain the lead to the end of the match. The victory of course gave Ndidi who was as usual in action for the entire duration of the match something to take home. Compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho was however not listed and will be hoping to have an opportunity in Leicester next match when they take on Luton Town in the League Cup on Tuesday at the Kenilworth Road.
