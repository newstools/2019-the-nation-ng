There is anxiety among supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Edo State as the National and State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal is about to deliver judgment on three petitions. The three petitions were filed by Barr. Omosede Igbinedion against the election of Hon Dennis Idahosa for Ovia Federal Constituency, Engr. Abubakar Momoh against the election of Senator Francis Alimikhena for Edo North Senator district and Mr. Patrick Idiake against the election Joe Edionwele for Esan West/Esan Centram and Iguenben Constituency. Security is currently tight at the court premises as many party members were prevented from gaining attention. The three-man tribunal panel headed by Justice O. Ogundana are already seated.
