President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday described the late veteran broadcaster, Alhaji Bashir Ismaila Ahmed, as “one of Nigeria’s finest journalists that I have ever known.” The president made the observation in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja. Buhari said: “I am greatly saddened by the demise of this great and widely respected broadcaster who had distinguished himself in his chosen profession. “The late Bashir had made a mark for himself which is one of the greatest achievements a man can be remembered for. “He was the darling of FRCN listeners in many Nigerian homes around the country because he did his job so well with insight and brilliance that others wanted to be like him. “I was not therefore surprised the late Bashir became a role model for many young men and women aspiring to be broadcasters.” While condoling the family, the FRCN family and the Kaduna State Government, President Buhari prayed to God to grant the deceased eternal rest.
