Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the state will remain safe, as security will never be taken for granted. He spoke on Thursday at the Lagos State House, Alausa, Ikeja, when he presented 120 security patrol vehicles and 35 patrol motorcycles to security personnel. The governor said although security was everybody’s concern, his administration would, however, take the lead by supporting security operatives with equipment and tools for effective performance. He assured security organisations that his government would engage them, saying: “We have all been working tirelessly and we must continue to work and ensure security of life and property.” Sanwo-Olu promised to raise the bar, re-strategise and introduce innovation soon in security infrastructure.
