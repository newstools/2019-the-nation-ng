SIXTY-TWO suspected political thugs have been arrested by the Niger State police command, believed to have been involved in the violence that trailed the council election primaries and campaigns by various political parties. The suspects were arrested in Katcha, Rafi, Tafa and Rijau local government areas of the state. Giving the breakdown of the arrests, the Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar said two suspects were arrested in Katcha LGA, 10 in Rafi LGA, 44 in Tafa LGA, three  in Paiko LGA and three in Rijau LGA. The PPRO said that some exhibits which include one Toyota vehicle laden with dangerous weapons such as machetes, daggers and knives were recovered from the suspects. Abubakar said the suspects have been charged to court for unlawful assembly, disturbance of public peace, being in possession of dangerous weapons and for sponsoring thuggish activities.
