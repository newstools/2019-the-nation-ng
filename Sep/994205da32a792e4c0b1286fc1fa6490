Legendary boxing trainer Ronnie Shields believes that Efe Ajagba can rule the heavyweight division in the near future. Ajagba remains undefeated in 11 fights with nine fights won by knockouts. He is seen as a promising star in the heavyweight division and made the headlines all over the world last year when his opponent, Curtis Harper, walked out of the fight after the bell sounded for the commencement of the fight. Shields has worked with the likes of former heavyweight champions -Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield – and has been training Ajagba since 2017. “Ajagba has everything it takes to become a world champion. His last fight, he went 10 rounds for the first time against Ali Demerizen. But he had an injury to his right elbow and this affected to land decent punches. If it wasn’t for that he would have won by Knock out,” Shields stated. “The heavyweight division today is great and in a year or so, all these young guys will be competing. They will be fighting for the world title. It has to happen and Efe has everything that it takes. I am so excited to be working with him. He will be back in October.” Ajagba is a Commonwealth Games bronze medalist and was the only boxer to represent Nigeria at the Olympic Games in 2016.
