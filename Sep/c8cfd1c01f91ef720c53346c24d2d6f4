A public relations expert, who is also an indigene of Niger Delta, Festus Masajuwa has stated that development in the Niger Delta area of the country will soon experience a new boost with the recent appointment of Bernard Okumagba as the new Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). He noted that this renewed optimism by the people of the region is as a result of Okumagba’s track record who is a highly dedicated professional that does not compromise efficiency in the delivery of mandate. He stated, “A distinguished former senior banker with the United Bank for Africa, Okumagba also served as commissioner for economic planning and later finance under Uduaghan between 2007 and 2015, and the people of the Niger Delta rejoin are highly optimistic the he will bring his experience to bear at NDDC. “The recent reconstitution of the Board of NDDC by President Muihammadu Buhari has received the approval of many Nigerians who hailed the president for the caliber of people he has brought on board, irrespective of some pockets of agitations bordering on tribalism and politics rather than merit.”
