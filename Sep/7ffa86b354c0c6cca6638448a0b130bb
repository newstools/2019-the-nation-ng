The Comptroller of Kirikiri Lighter Terminal (KLT) Customs Command, Mrs. Morenike Oladunni, has described her team as a ‘’model of Customs dream for improved modernisation, pursuing facilitation of legitimate trade and keeping to government’s Ease of Doing Business policy’’. Mrs. Oladunni stated this at the close of work get-together in honour of a retired Assistant Comptroller, Mrs Juliet Akabogu, in the Command. “A combination of punctuality, commitment to duty and non-compromise on rules has made this command the fastest in clearing in Nigeria. ‘’After the lodgement of Single Goods Declaration (SGD) forms, no consignment with genuine declaration suffers delay as they get exited from the port within 48 hours,” she said, adding that her team must continue to ensure that no one breaks the chain of optimum productivity in Customs operations. She charged officers and men to  keep to the rules and directives of the Service’s Controller-General. Mrs Oladunni described Mrs Akabogu as a loyal and diligent officer of the service. She wished her success in her future endeavours. Meanwhile, the command collected N9,497,704,598, which represents over 93 per cent of total revenue target for 2019. NCS said the figure for this year also surpassed the N6,302,228,485 made by the command within same period of last year.
