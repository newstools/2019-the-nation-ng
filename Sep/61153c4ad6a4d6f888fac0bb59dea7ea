Everton’s playmaker, Gylfi Sigurdsson has said that the two goals that Alex Iwobi scored for the Toffees this season will boost his confidence going into the international break. Iwobi who is currently with the Super Eagles in Dnipro, venue of their upcoming friendly game against Ukraine tomorrow netted his first goal in Everton shirt during a Carabao Cup fixture against Lincoln City and got his second against Wolves, after an inviting cross from Sigurdsson, in a game that ended 3-2 in favor of the Toffees. Speaking to Liverpool Echo, Sigurdsson praised Iwobi for making an immediate impact in the team stressing that it was nice to see the Nigerian score his first Everton goal in only his second game for the club. “Of course for him, for an attacking player, it’s nice to get that first goal early on,” he said. ”It’s good for the confidence and all of the other boys, not just him. With Fabian Delph coming back from injury and Djibril Sidibe, who made his Everton debut against Lincoln City, there’s good depth in the squad at the moment.”
