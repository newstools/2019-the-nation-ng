THROUGH their managements, three South African companies – MTN Nigeria, MultiChoice and Shoprite – on Tuesday condemned the attacks of foreign nationals in South Africa. The firms said that their mission in Nigeria was purely business. Reacting to the resurgence of xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in its home country which has led to death and destruction of properties, the MTN said that its “mission is to connect people and create a platform so that everyone’s voice could be heard. “We seek to connect people, bring people together and provide a platform for everyone’s voice to be heard. We are against all forms of bigotry and discrimination; they should have no place in society. “Everyone has the right to a world where their rights and freedoms are respected — the right to live and earn a living, freely, safely and protected by the law,” the terse statement read.” MultiChoice also restated its commitment to uniting Africans through programming and cultural initiatives. It said in statement by its Chief Executive, John Ugbe: “We are advocates equality and condemn all forms of discrimination. The ongoing violence in South Africa against foreign nationals is against the spirit of Africa and counterproductive to the decades of work done by African leaders and well-meaning organisations to unite the continent.  We and celebrate the diversity of varied nationalities, traditions cultures and religions from across the continent and beyond. “This is demonstrated through our multinational staff complement, our multicultural supply chain as well as the local and international content that will showcase on both our Dstv and Gotv platforms. “We believe Africa’s full potential can only be realised through dialogue peace and unity this is a sombre period for every African on the continent and beyond and we urge all our consumers followers and stakeholders to shun violence.”
