Three persons were confirmed dead at the Onigaari corridor of the Lagos – Ibadan expressway when a speeding Toyota Sienna veered off lane and rammed into a truck parked by the road side. The accident which involved Toyota Sienna marked MUS 932 FE and a nondescript MACK truck parked by the road side also left five other people gravely injured. The Public Relations Officer of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi, who confirmed the auto crash to The Nation, attributed the cause to “over speeding and reckless driving on the part of the Toyota Sienna driver.” Babatunde said that the Sienna rammed into a stationary tipper (truck) by the roadside, resulting in injuries to five people and fatality to three others. He added that the injured were rescued to the Victory Hospital Ogere while those presumed dead were deposited at the FOS Mortuary, Ipara – Remo, Ogun State. Babatunde said: “We learnt the Sienna is a commercial vehicle loaded from Ibadan to Lagos when it suddenly lost control due to over speeding and reckless driving before ramming into a stationary tipper parked by the road side. “TRACE Corps commiserate with the family of the dead and also use this medium to advise motorists to avoid over speeding, especially during the rainy season because of the attendant challenges. “Articulated vehicles are also advised to desist from using the road as a garage for parking.”
