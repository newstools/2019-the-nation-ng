Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has called on the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and port concessionaires to address the menace of cargo vandalism at the seaports by suspected wharf rats. Reacting to allegations of complicity leveled against his members, MWUN President-General, Adewale Adeyanju, said labour workers at the terminals were well paid and could not be involved in any  criminal activity at the seaport.  He said  he had warned dockworkers to desist from physical examination of containers. According to Adeyanju, the development, if not urgently addressed, will send wrong signals to the international maritime community about Nigerian ports. Adeyanju urged licensed customs agents  to manage information sharing, saying pilfering of containers at the terminals could be traced to insiders of the customs service, terminal operators and officials of NPA. He insisted that dockworkers had been discharging their duties diligently for over a decade without any cargo vandalism, adding that the ugly trend resurfaced recently. “We will not accept any form of accusation from any quarters  that dockworkers are part of the people damaging or vandalising containers at the seaports because we are responsible and committed to workers welfare packages. The clearing agents, canteen boys, kelebes all have ideas about information on consignment but the dockworkers have no idea about the vessel, the manifest and what she discharges,” Adeyanju said. He also called on the labour workers to desist from any form of practice that would tarnish the image of the union, noting that anyone who gets himself involved in illegal business will cease to be part of the union.
