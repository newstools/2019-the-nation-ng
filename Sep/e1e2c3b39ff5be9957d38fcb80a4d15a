Zamfara State Ministry of Information Permanent Secretary Alhaji Yakubu Tsafe on Thursday said he had set up a committee to investigate financial transactions at the Zamfara Radio and Television stations. Tsafe spoke in Gusau when he visited the stations. “In the civil service system, policies and due process must be respectfully adhered to and any violation will have to be investigated in order to put the records straight. “I have already set up a committee that will come to this station and verify financial transactions that took place in recent times covering activities of the present management. “We will reorganise this station but before that, the management will have to give account of the revenue generated from the inception of the present administration. “This is so that we can return same to the state government coffers,” he said. Earlier, Executive Chairman of the stations Malam Saidu Maishanu appealed to the ministry to be releasing funds for running the stations. Maishanu’s request followed the directive by Governor Bello Matawalle for the station to start generating revenue and make returns to the government.
