Two Big Brother Naija housemates, Esther Agunbiade and Daniel Tioluwa also referred to as Sir Dee have been evicted from the ongoing reality TV show. The duo were evicted at the live eviction show held on Sunday, making them the 13th and 14th housemates to leave since the commencement of the show on June 30. Esther, the first female Head of House and first woman to hold the position twice in this season, spoke with host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu about her relationship with Frodd and Nelson, saying, “Frodd is sweet and Nelson is my G.” When Sir Dee was brought on the stage and asked about his feelings for Diane, he said he only had a “brother, sister” relationship with her and did not feel anything more for her. Judging from recent Twitter polls, Esther seems to be the least liked housemate and some social media users have been anticipating her exit from the house, especially because of her relationship with Frodd.
