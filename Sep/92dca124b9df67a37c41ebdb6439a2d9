School principals billed to attend this year’s International Confederation of Principals in Shanghai, China, have urged the Chinese authorities to facilitate the issuance of visas to them. They said the delay was caused by the non-issuance of a verification certificate needed for visa application. The international bi-annual convention attracts the largest gathering of school principals. A delegate, who pleaded not to be named, said: “The Chinese organising committee has tried everything to enable us get visas. “The Chinese authorities have refused so far to grant the verification certificate which is necessary for us to be issued visas. “This development becomes particularly worrisome considering that quite a good number of principals from other countries have long received their visa.” The delegate said his counterparts from Ghana, for instance, have all been issued visas. He wondered why the case is different for Nigerian delegates. He said: “Apart from the fact that the event commences on October 20, principals in Nigeria have already committed a lot of money into the event. “Already, we have committed money on registration, we have spent a lot to purchase flight ticket, and have also spent quite a huge sum to book for accommodation and so on. “This explains why we are all jittery because if it eventually happens that we are not given visas, what then becomes of the huge sum of money we have all committed? “Do they just go down the drain like that? Will they return our money, or will the Chinese authorities compensate us?” The delegate said Nigerians who previously attended the conference were of good behaviour. “We have never for once been implicated in any kind of malfeasance, so why all these unmerited treatment?”
