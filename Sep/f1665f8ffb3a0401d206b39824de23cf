AHEAD of the December 7 local government elections in Ekiti, Governor Kayode Fayemi said on Tuesday that he has no preferred candidates for the forthcoming primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Fayemi in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olayinka Oyebode, said he remained committed to his earlier stance that there would be no anointed aspirants, cautioning people against dropping his name in a bid to scuttle laid down procedure. The governor also directed the leadership of the APC in the state to ensure a transparent and hitchfree process for the emergence of the party’s candidates. Governor Fayemi said that every effort must be made to ensure genuine consensus on candidates’ emergence, adding that clear primary should be the mode of selection, where consensus is impossible. “Primaries must be well done in a way that even losers will know that they lost fair and square and I have no preferred candidate anywhere. Everybody should go and work for the support of their people. After all, I went through primaries even as a former Governor and leader of the party,” he said. The governor also urged members of the party to show good examples to others by observing laid down rules of the party and ensuring that differences arising from the contest are resolved amicably.
