A suspected cultist Aliu Lamidi, 29, was on Saturday night stabbed to death after rival groups clashed at Chukwuma Hotel in Babashola Street, Itire, Lagos. The hotel and some vehicles parked around it were also set ablaze in the fight that commenced around 10:50pm. It was gathered that violence erupted after an altercation between rival cult groups in the hotel which led to the owner’s son stabbing Lamidi on the neck.   Lamidi, a resident of Aboredhade Street, was said to have died at the hospital he was rushed to, a development that provoked his colleagues. Although the immediate cause of the altercation was unknown, The Nation reports that the Aiye and Eiye cult groups have been embroiled in age-long rivalry that has claimed many lives across the state. Angered by the killing of Lamidi, his members were said to have torched the hotel, vehicles and moved in droves to the home of the owner in a bid to kill anyone found. Wielding cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, the hoodlums were said to have threatened firefighters and policemen from Itire who got to the scene to put out the inferno. It was gathered that the violence continued Sunday morning and extended to Oseni street which prompted the deployment of reinforcement from the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the Area Command led by Deputy Commission of Police (DCP) Tunji Disu.  The police were said to have prevented the cultists from wreaking further havoc as they chased the hoodlums and eventually arrested eight of the culprits. Confirming the incident spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) said security has been beefed up. He said the hotel’s owner’s son was currently at large, adding that investigation was ongoing and all suspects would be charged to court.
