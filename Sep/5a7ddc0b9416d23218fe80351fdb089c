Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State were in wild jubilation Wednesday after the tribunal dismissed the petition filed by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar against the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Edo State Secretary of the APC, Mr. Lawrence Okah who spoke to newsmen said the presidential election was lost and won since February 23rd, 2019 when the election was conducted. Okah said the PDP merely embarked on academic exercise by going to the tribunal without evidence. He said the PDP was lucky that the tribunal Judges did not look at the non-qualification of Atiku that he is not a Nigerian. “We thank Nigerians and Edo people for voting and supporting Buhari. It is now for us to settle down and make Nigerians proud. “We will appeal all the cases we lost at the National and State Assembly Election Petitions tribunal here in the state.” The lawmaker representing Ovia Federal Constituency, Hon Dennis Idahosa, praised the judgement as the best in the history of election matters in the country. Hon Idahosa said nothing would put the country on the reverse gear again as the APC led administration is already putting smiles on the faces of Nigerians. Idahosa urged Nigerians to support the Buhari’s administration since the tribunal has put the election matters to rest.
