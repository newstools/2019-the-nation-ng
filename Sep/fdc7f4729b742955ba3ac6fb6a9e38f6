 The 31-year-old Croatia international forward returned to Serie A, having previously played for Fiorentina in 2015-17 and Milan in 2018-19. He was sold to Atletico Madrid for â‚¬14.5m last summer, but struggled for regular playing time with four goals in 24 competitive games. Kalinic is one of several transfer deadline day arrivals for Roma, the other main one being Henrikh Mkhitaryan on loan from Arsenal. Both had their medicals at the Villa Stuart clinic this morning.
