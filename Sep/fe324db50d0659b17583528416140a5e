The 123 indigenes of Jigawa state arrested on Friday in a truck at Agege with 48 motorcycles by the State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offenses (Task force) were on Saturday released by the Lagos State Police Command. They were handed over immediately to the police for profiling after arrest but according to a report from POLISADMIN, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Ikhana, said after profiling of the men, nothing incriminating was found on them and they were released. He said the suspicion and subsequent interception of the truck arose from the manner they came in, in large number sardined in a truck, adding that most of them were living in Lagos and went homes for the Eid-l-kabir celebration. According to a statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso,Â  the interception on Friday by the task force was a proactive step to protect the state against any external attack. The task force, headed by Mr. Olayinka Egbeyemi a Chief Superintendent of Police, had said the men were arrested following a tip off by members of the public, who allegedly raised security concerns about the manner in which the occupants of the truck conducted themselves.
