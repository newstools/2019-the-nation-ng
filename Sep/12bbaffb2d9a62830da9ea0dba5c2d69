A 32-year-old businessman, Chinedu Okoye, who allegedly obtained N14 million from a man to solve his ”spiritual problems”, on Monday appeared in an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Okoye is charged with conspiracy, obtaining under false pretences and perverting the cause of justice, to which he pleaded not guilty. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Ingobo Emby, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between March 1 and April 24, at Plot 3508, Dominic Obiajiku St., Devine Estate, Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos. Emby said that the defendant fraudulently obtained N14 million from Mr Obiora Elefobiri, that he would provide spiritual solutions for him, a representation he knew was false. “He did not provide the spiritual solutions, but converted the money to his personal use,” the prosecutor said. Emby said the defendant also conducted himself in a manner likely to pervert the cause of justice by aiding the escape of his elder brother, Arinze Okoye, a suspect under investigation in a case of conspiracy and fraud. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened the provisions of sections 97(1), 287, 314(2) and 411of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate M.O. Ope-Agbe admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N17 million with two sureties in like sum. Ope-Agbe adjourned the case until Oct. 16 for mention. (NAN)
