Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson has warned leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against unauthorised use of his name as Chairman of the party’s  Governors Forum to issue statements. The governor, in a statement  by his Chief Press Secretary, Fidelis Soriwei, condemned the use of his name without seeking his clarifications and consent to make comments on national issues. Dickson said while he was reputed for making comments on sensitive national issues, it was odd and criminal for any person or group of persons to make attributions to him in statements he did not authorise. Whike warning persons behind the  deplorable act to desist forthwith, he stressed that it was the conventional standard for him to be consulted on all statements to avoid misrepresentation. The governor directed that every statement from the forum must be personally authorised by him. He said: “It has come to my attention that some members of the Peoples Democratic Party are using my name to issue statements without seeking my consent and approval especially on issues involving the PDP Governors Forum. “Everyone knows that I am capable of taking positions on national issues. Cowards should not hide under my name and that of the forum to make statements. I have always made statements on issues that I am passionate about without any fear. “I condemn in very strong terms any tendency to willfully use my name to issue statement without my consent. It is reprehensible, condemnable and must stop forthwith. “Henceforth all statements emanating from the PDP Governors Forum must be authorised personally by me.”
