Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said that Nigerians who attend the World Economic Forum(WEF) in South Africa deserves to be sent to Nuremberg, Germany for the next yam festival. He spoke hours after former Minister of Education Oby Ezekwesili, came under fire for attending the ongoing WEF in South Africa despite federal government’s boycott of the event over xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in the country. According to the former Minister, those who attended the summit are ‘pissing’ on the blood and dancing on the graves of their compatriots that have been tortured and butchered in the streets of South Africa. He wrote: “Nigerians that attend the World Economic Forum in South Africa deserve to be sent to Nuremberg, Germany for the next yam festival! “They are pissing on the blood and dancing on the graves of their compatriots that have been tortured, maimed and butchered in the streets of SA.” Nigeria, alongside some African countries, boycotted the two-day summit holding in Cape Town following the attack on foreigners in South Africa. Ezekwesili earned heavy criticisms from Nigerians after photos of her attending the summit surfaced on social media.
