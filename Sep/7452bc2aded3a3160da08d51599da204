One person was feared killed in a fracas between transport union members in Okokomaiko Motor Park on Lagos-Badagry Expressway. The incident occurred on Wednesday night around 8pm The Nation learnt that many were injured as the gangsters used dangerous weapons freely during the melee. Motorists and passersby on the busy route were said to have scampered for safety. The warring groups, it was learnt, inflicted injuries on those caught unawares. Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Lagos State chapter Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo) told The Nation that NURTW members were not involved in the fracas Akinsanya said those fighting are members of the Road Transport Employees Association of Nigeria (RTEAN). He said, “I have called our members at Okokomaiko Motor Park and they told me that it is RTEAN members that are fighting. I also sent some people to find out what is happening in Okokomaiko but I got the same report that those fighting are not members of our union. ” In any case, there is no reason for our members to fight one another because we have warned that the branches’ leadership should remain in office. We have also warned that no one should go and take over any branch. “Anyone that does that risks being jailed. So, there is no point for our members to fight themselves.” The NURTW boss said insinuation that he and his predecessor, Tajudeen Agbede are at loggerheads should be jettisoned. “We were still together. There is no issue between us. He is an elder statesman in the union who wants peace to reign and he demonstrated it in his actions. People should cross-check their facts before going on social media, ” he said. It would be recalled that a leadership tussle is brewing between the Lagos State chapter of the RTEAN and its national body. Both in different publications announced the removal and counter-removal of the National President and the state executive.
