Widow of Zimbabwe’s former President Robert Mugabe, Grace Mugabe, will keep the fortune accrued by her family during her husband’s 37 years in power, authorities said on Tuesday. “President Emmerson Mnangagwa has assured the family that they will keep their wealth,” said Obert Mpofu, secretary for administration of the ruling party, Zanu-PF. The Mugabes are one of the most affluent families in Zimbabwe, owning multiple properties, including a dairy farm, a private school, and a game reserve. However, Mugabe’s villa, known as the “Blue Roof,” in Harare’s elite suburb of Borrowdale Brooke, and another mansion where their daughter, Bona lives, are in Zanu-PF’s name. Mnangagwa, whose challenge to Grace Mugabe’s leadership ambitions in part led to her husband’s overthrow by the military in 2017, had on several occasions said the family would be taken care of.
