Is  he a psychiatric patient or a mere thief? And did he really rob a bank in Kwara State? Whatever the case, the police in the state Tuesday picked up a midle-aged man who they said burst into a new generation bank in Ilorin, the state capital, and immediately started picking up money on the counter. The police later determined that  the bank ‘thief’ is actually a psychiatric patient, and was taken to a mental home in the state capital. The news of the ‘robbery’ incident spread like wildfire in the metropolis of Ilorin, as residents became jittery and apprehensive. Speaking on the development, spokesperson of the police command Ajayi Okasanmi described the robbery report as false alarm, Mr. Okasanmi said, “Kwara State police command wishes to inform the general public of the unfounded news going round that armed robbers invaded a bank in Tanke area of ilorin this morning. This has brought about some level of panic and agitation in the people. “The command wishes to state that what actually transpired was that a man strayed into the said bank, and started packing monies on the bank counter which eventually led to commotion in the banking hall. Policemen came in and arrested the suspect who was promptly taken away. Preliminary investigation, however, revealed that the suspect is of unsound mind. “Meanwhile, peace has been restored and aggressive patrols of Ilorin has been ordered by the Commissioner of Police Kayode Egbetokun to further instil confidence in members of the public and especially Banks in the state. “ Finally,  members of the public are advised to be conscious of happenings around  them and report any suspicions movement to the police.”
