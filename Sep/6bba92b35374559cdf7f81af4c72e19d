The body of an eighty year old woman, Hannatu Kefas, who had been missing for several days, has been recovered. Her corpse, which had decomposed, was discovered at her farmland on Saturday and buried there immediately. An in-law to the deceased, Khadimoh Dani Ishaku, told reporters that the octogenarian, a peasant farmer, had left home for her farm in Kodei village, Karmi Lamido local government area of Taraba state. He said Hannatu Kefas was murdered by unidentified ritualists. “The woman was murdered closed to a popular bar joint known as Forest Parliament in Angwan Giwa Tafadi in Karim Lamido where miscreants are used to carrying out evil activities. Ishaku also alleged that the private organs of the deceased, including eyes, had been removed. But police spokesman, David Missal who confirmed the report to The Nation, said the incident was still been investigated so he cannot say “miscreants or ritualists” were behind Hannatu’s death. Misal called for the interrogation of those saying the octogenarian was murdered and her body parts were removed. He said: “The woman had been missing for several days. The family did not report to us (police). “Now, her body has been discovered at her farm. The body was so terribly decomposed that they were not able to park the remains. “They just dug a grave there and buried her. So, how did they notice that her private parts were removed when everything about her had decayed? “No autopsy has been done to establish injuries or any cause of death. “So, why are they trying to mislead people, or do they know something about her death? “In fact I want anyone saying her private parts have been removed to be interrogated. It points to the fact that such a person has knowledge of the woman’s death.” The locals said the “mysterious death” of Hannatu is one among five other similar death cases. They called for security to probe, arrest and punish the perpetrators.
