 Super Falcons have been told to settle for only victories in their remaining qualifiers leading to the 2020 Olympics,  as that is the only news Nigerians expect to hear. Sports minister Sunday Dare who gave the charge opined that it is the business of the girls to do their job on the pitch, promising that government on its part will ensure their welfare. The Minister who visited the girls at their Abuja Stadium training camp on Tuesday, had only few days ago waded into the sudden disappearance of the team’s coach Thomas Dernneby who is being suspected to have dumped the job. “This morning I visited the super falcons during their training at the Moshood Abiola Stadium Abuja. I gave inspiring words and assured them that the government will ensure their welfare. I told them Nigerians will expect only victories in their remaining qualifiers,” the minister revealed Tuesday. Falcons will in continuation of their 2020 Olympic Qualifiers take on their Ivorian counterparts September 30th with the return leg billed for Lagos October 4th. The Super Falcons who got a bye in the first round of the Olympic qualifiers edged out Algerian ladies 3-0 in the second round to earn a place in the third round. Should the Falcons succeed in disarming Cote d Ivoire in the forth-coming two legged third round, they will face either DR Congo or Cameroon in the fourth round.
