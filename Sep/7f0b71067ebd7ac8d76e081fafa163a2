Anene said one suspect has been arrested, adding that ” as soon as we have concluded interrogating him, we will give out the full information”. She said, for now NAN gathered that the suspect, a gang leader of a kidnapped and armed robbery syndicate, was arrested following tip-off by members of the community. The suspect and his gang were alleged to be killing their victims and burrying them after collecting their motorcycles in order to conceal their crime and avoid arrest.
