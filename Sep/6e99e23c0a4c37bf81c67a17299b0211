Mercy and Tacha may be disqualified or get strikes from the organisers of the Big Brother Naija show for engagement violence in the House. There was serious drama in House on Friday, which led to Tacha hitting Mercy. This happened after both housemates engaged in a heated argument, leading to what appears like a physical confrontation. Seyi had earlier called on Mercy to come to the lounge so they can read Biggie’s scroll. However, Mercy who just finish having her bath, came out late for the reading. Tacha, who was already boiling, seized the opportunity to rain insults on Mercy. She said: ”You are a moron, remain there and don’t come out. clout chaser, old woman. You keep using your body to get everything you want. You have been using Ike to get what you want. You can’t stand eviction that is why you need Ike to help you.” Mercy replied: ” You are very stupid, you Instagram beggar. Go and treat your body odour before you talk to me, you stink. At least, I have a boyfriend (Ike) to get me what I want. What has your boyfriend done for you?” During the argument, Tacha pushed Mercy and also dragged her weave-on twice while Mercy struggled to control her anger. She picked up a pressing iron but was stopped by Omashola.
