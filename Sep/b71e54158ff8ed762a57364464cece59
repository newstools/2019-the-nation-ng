CONTRACTORS are expected to begin delivery of various office equipment and other items for federal legislators at the National Assembly this week. While cars requested by the Service Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives are to be  delivered in batches after the National Assembly’s recess  on September 24,  contractors are expected to deliver some   of the office equipment to the National Assembly’s stores before then. On Tuesday, April 23 this year, then Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Danjuma Goje revealed that outgoing lawmakers in the 8th National Assembly led by Senator Bukola Saraki allocated N23.7 billion for settlement of federal legislators’ severance and induction of members of the 9th National Assembly who came into office on June 11, this year. In accordance with what has become a tradition, outgoing members of the 8th National Assembly expended a fraction of their severance benefits to purchase computers, photo copying machines, printers, television sets and refrigerators earlier allocated to their offices at hugely discounted prices ‘based on depreciation.’ According to tradition too, one of the first set of ad hoc committees immediately appointed by both the Senate President and Speaker once they are elected are the two legislative chambers’ respective Services Committee whose mandate includes recommending the procurement of suitable vehicles, office needs and other requirements that may aid the legislative process. Thus far, the management of the National Assembly has ensured utmost secrecy about arrangements for the multi-billion procurement of new cars but The Nation’s findings indicate that the cars are to be delivered in batches and collected by the verified aides and drivers of each legislator at a destination within Abuja but outside the National Assembly complex. While several car suppliers are being involved, the name of Elizade Motors Limited is being prominently mentioned as it has delivered in good time in the past. Some smaller contractors/suppliers were also said to have procured their vehicles through the Elizade in the past. “Numerous contractors are supplying office furniture and furnishings; it is likely that Lanre Shittu Motors and a major supplier from Kaduna will be supplying cars this time around,” a source at the National Assembly stated.
