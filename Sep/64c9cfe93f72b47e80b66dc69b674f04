A car dealer, Innocent Odiba, was on Thursday arraigned before a Tinubu Magistratesâ€™ Court, Lagos for allegedly defrauding a customer, Mark Ochigbo, of N1.7 million. Odiba, 34, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and theft before Magistrate T.A. Anjorin-Ajose. The Prosecutor, Insp. Ajaga Agboko, told the court that the defendant committed the offence sometime in July 2018 at No. 38, Balola Street, Palm Groove, Lagos. He said that Odiba conspired with a relative of the complainant to defraud one Ochigbo of N1.7million under the pretence of helping him to buy a car from overseas since 2018. Agboko said that whenever Ochigbo asked Odiba of the car, he would inform him that the car was yet to arrive at the Lagos Port. He said that a relative of Ochigbo introduced the defendant to him as a car dealer. He told the court that since 2018 Odiba could not deliver the car as promised and he also did not return the money. Odiba, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Magistrate Anjorin-Ajose, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the case until September 19.
