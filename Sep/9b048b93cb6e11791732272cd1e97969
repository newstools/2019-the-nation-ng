The Abia State Command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have paraded two persons arrested for allegedly dealing in illegal petroleum products. The suspects, Osondu Nweke and Ogbonna Uchendu from Anambra and Abia, were reportedly arrested at Ukwa West Local Government Area of the state by operatives of the anti-vandal unit of the command. NSCDC State Commandant, Mr. Nnamdi Nwannukwu while parading the suspects before journalists said that Osondu was arrested in a Mack Truck tanker with 33,000 litres of dark viscous liquid suspected to be petroleum product. According to him, Uchendu was equally arrested in an 18-seater bus loaded with two 800 litre-GeePee tanks and a 120-litre drum of a similar product. He said that the suspects would be arraigned at the end of the ongoing investigation by the command. In another development, the commandant has decorated some of the newly promoted officers of the corps that were recently promoted to new ranks. Addressing the officers numbering about 65, during a brief ceremony, Nwannukwu charged them “to live up to the expectations that come with such promotions.” He said, “Take note that this promotion has positioned you for a new assignment. It comes with a lot of responsibility.”
