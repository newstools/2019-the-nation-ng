They have no regret going back to the lands. The more we invest in agriculture, the better for us”. Mr Gates congratulated President Buhari “for assembling a cabinet that excites us”. The American philanthropist said he was pleased that one of the priorities of the administration was human capital development, of which health, nutrition and education are key components.

We are delighted about that. Nigeria is our biggest commitment in Africa. It’s only in India we do more in the world,” Gates said.
