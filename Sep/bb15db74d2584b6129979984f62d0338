The team has played well. “Also, to show further stamp our firepower is the testimony of that can be seen in the last African Games where the team won the gold. “We will continue to support the team morally and financially in their quest to qualify for the Olympics,” he said. The Falcons coach, Dennerby said he was not impressed with the slim margin win, adding that there were more works to do. “The match is not impressive seriously; we have to look at what went wrong during the match. “The match played was not what we expected maybe the team needs more drilling, but we are sure of qualification all the same,” he said.
