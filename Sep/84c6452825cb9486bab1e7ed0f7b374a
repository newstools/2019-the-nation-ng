The Ekiti State Chapter of Trade Union Congress (TUC) has appealed to Governor Kayode Fayemi to enforce implementation of the erosion control masterplan drawn for the state at its creation in 1996. The labour union equally urged the governor to prepare a new masterplan for Ado Ekiti capital city if none had been provided to rescue the situation in the past. Chairman of the TUC in Ekiti, Sola Adigun, who led other leaders of the council yesterday on inspection of some of the areas affected, including Onala, Emirin, and Oke Ureje, Polytechnic road, among others, expressed shock at the level of devastation caused by the flood. “The level of this devastation appears unprecedented. This is unarguably heightened by the reality of climate change responsible for the rise in water level. Unfortunately, the attitude of our people such as building on water ways, indiscriminate dumping of waste in drainages compound this challenge.” Speaking with newsmen during the visit, Adigun, who commended Fayemi for his prompt visit to the areas and donation of relief materials worth millions of naira to the affected EKSU students, also lauded other agencies which had visited the areas. While calling on other agencies to complement the efforts of the state government, he also called for the mobilisation of experts to save the Ureje Bridge from total collapse. The TUC chairman stressed the need for urgent dredging of the Ureje River and other rivers prone to overflowing their natural course, pleading with the federal government to provide financial support for the state.
