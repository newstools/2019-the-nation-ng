If Canada is the destination for foreign education, the chance of a Nigerian getting a study permit from the authorities is an abysmal 29 percent, according to a report published by Polestar Students Immigration News. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) statistics on the top 25 countries that apply for Canadian study permit and their rejection rates between January and May 2019, Nigeria is the country with the third highest rejection rate – a position it shares with Pakistan. The only other countries with higher rejection rates are Algeria (86 per cent) and Cameroun (82 per cent). The report stated that Nigeria, one of the top-source countries of foreign students to Canada, has more than 12,000 applications for study permit to Canada yearly. There are eight African countries on the list – with three out of every four African likely to be denied study permit. Morocco had the lowest rejection rate among the African countries (51 per cent), followed by Ghana (62 per cent) compared to the lowest rejection rate of four per cent from Japan and Republic of Korea. However, the report noted that Japan and Korean students were more likely to apply for English-as-a-second-language (ESL) programmes, which have lower refusal rates. Canada has developed a strategy to get more students from 11 countries. Only Morocco and Senegal made the list in Africa. According to the report, the main reason for rejection include suspicion that the applicant would defect; insufficient funds for study and living expenses; poor academic plan, security threat, incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent application.
