Ahead of Nigeria’s 59th Independence Day anniversary, singer Mr Bigger has released a single titled, One Nigeria. Mr Bigger, whose real name is Bigger Ibekwe, said the song is to fire the spirit of unity and patriotism in Nigerians. The gospel artiste said One Nigeria was inspired when he saw a poster of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in Surulere, Lagos. “I saw a very big billboard with the portrait of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with a statement, ‘We must move forward’,” said Mr Bigger. “I began to ponder on the statement and then I saw the beauty in all of us moving forward together and that gave birth to the song.” He blamed faulty leadership and not diversity of the country as the major challenge affecting the nation’s unity. He said: “The problem we have in Nigeria is not our tribal differences; it’s our leadership difference problem and the mindset of our leaders. China has about 374 tribes yet they are together, they surrender all to stay together as one but that is not the case in Nigeria.” On the need to promote one Nigeria through music, Mr Bigger said: “Music is something that has a lasting effect where a lot of impact will be felt.”
