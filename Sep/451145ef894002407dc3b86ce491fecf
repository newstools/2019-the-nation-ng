Submission of entries for the 2019 Maltina Teacher of the Year (MTOY)  award  has closed with a record number of 1,310 entries from the 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This is a 104 percentage increase over last year’s entries of 641. This year’s entries are also the highest ever recorded by the initiative since inception in 2015. Speaking on the development, the Corporate Affairs Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc., Sade Morgan, said this year’s entries showed a substantial improvement in the level of participation by teachers, which is a confirmation of the growing interest and acceptance of the initiative as a platform for rewarding the efforts and commitments of teachers. Of the lot, she said the project assessors pruned the number down to 548. “All the valid entries will now be subjected to evaluation and assessment by our esteemed panel of judges, who will determine the applicants to emerge as state champions based on the set criteria,” Mrs Morgan said. She said the top 10 among the selected state champions would go through a rigorous screening round that would feature interviews. “Once the state champions have been determined, the 10 best entries from the pool of the state champions will be selected and invited for another round of assessment where the Jury will further subject them to rigorous scrutiny against established set criteria in order to determine who truly should be named the Maltina Teacher of the Year,” she said. This year’s winners would be unveiled at a grand event scheduled for Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. The winner of the 2019 Maltina Teacher of the Year will get a cash prize worth N6.5 million and capacity training abroad.
