Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has sent an open letter to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abukabar Malami (SAN), on the detention of Sahara Reporters publisher Omoyele Sowore. The organisation urged him “to without delay enter a nolle prosequi (the dismissal or termination of legal proceedings by the Attorney General) and discontinue the prosecution of Sowore and Olawale Bakare (aka Mandate) for apparently politically motivated charges of treason, fraud and ‘insulting President Muhammadu Buhari'”. SERAP said: “We urge you to use your role as a trustee of the public interest under Section 174 of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) to end several of similar trumped-up cases going on in several states.” In the letter, dated September 21 and signed by SERAP’s Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, the group said: “Sowore’s case and several similar cases instigated/brought by state governors make a hideous mockery of Nigeria’s criminal justice systems, rule of law, freedom of expression and media freedom. “These cases are persecution and not prosecution. As guardian of the public interest, you have a role to end this travesty now and to maintain the sanctity and integrity of Nigeria’s justice system.” Also, a group of activists, under the aegis of Peoples Alternative Front (PAF), has demanded the unconditional release of Sowore and Olawale Bakare from the Department of State Services (DSS) for alleged terrorism and treason.
