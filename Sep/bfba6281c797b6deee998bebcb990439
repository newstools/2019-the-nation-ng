(NAF) on Tuesday said its attack aircraft detailed by the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has destroyed a Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) camp at Abulam, a settlement on the fringes of the Allagarno Forest, in Borno State. According to a statement signed the Director of Public Relations and Information Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, the operation was executed on 22 September after series of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed that some buildings within the settlement were being used by the terrorists to store their supplies and other resources. “The ATF therefore dispatched helicopter gunships and ground attack aircraft to engage the location in successive strikes, scoring devastating hits on the target area leading to destruction of several of the buildings and neutralization of their BHT occupants,” it stated, adding “the NAF, operating in concert with surface Forces, will sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast”.
