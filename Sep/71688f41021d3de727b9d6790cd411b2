A man, Mr. Pius Ukrakpo, was on Tuesday stabbed to death by the husband and brother-in-law of a married woman identified as Mama Ejime. They alleged that the late Ukrakpo had purportedly made romantic approach to Mama Ejime. A source had revealed that Ukrakpo met his death at hospital road in Jeddo community, Okpe local government area of Delta State when the said Mama Ejime invited him to her house without knowing his killer had laid ambush. The source said Ukrakpo was shocked when he saw Mama Ejime’s husband and his brother coming out from their hiding. They allegedly stabbed and poured pepper on him until they confirmed he was no longer breathing. His assailants were said to have locked the house’s burglary proof, frustrating all attempt by the deceased to seek for help. It was gathered that he died before neighbours could come to his rescue while Mama Ejime was said to have escaped. Her husband and his brother were however handed over to the Orerokpe Police Division with the assistance of the Jeddo Community Vigilante. All attempts to confirm incident from the Delta State Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO) failed, as he could not be reached for comments.
