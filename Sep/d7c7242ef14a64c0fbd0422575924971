THE All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon, has asked Governor Seriake Dickson to leave the APC alone and focus on the post-primary election crisis rocking his party. In a statement yesterday in Yenagoa, the state capital, by his Media Adviser, Chief Gift Ebiki, the APC candidate wondered why Dickson was crying more than the bereaved on issues that have nothing to do with him. He said the governor was dissipating his energy and wasting his time on frivolous matters. The APC candidate was alluding to the governor’s claims in a live media chat that the main opposition in the state lacked a validly-elected and qualified candidate for the November 16 governorship poll in the state. “As a sitting governor,  Dickson should concentrate more on governance rather than turning himself into a mischief-maker and a busybody,” he said. Lyon added: “The statement credited to Dickson is unbecoming of a governor; it’s the highest mischief and derogatory of a sitting governor. “The APC indeed has a validly elected candidate and he is Chief David Lyon. Governor Dickson is not in a position to discuss APC matters; he should concern himself with the crisis tearing his party, the PDP. “It is only INEC that can talk of parties’ candidates being validly nominated or not. Indeed, Chief David Lyon is the Candidate of the APC. “This clearly shows that Governor Dickson hand is behind some failed APC aspirants’ desire to cause confussion in APC but they have failed woefully because bayelsains are more informed than they imagined.”
