The Abia State election petition tribunal in Umuahia has dismissed the petition against the lawmaker representing Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, Uko Nkole. The All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate in the election, Nnamdi Orji, approached the tribunal to invalidate Nkole’s election, alleging corrupt practices and non-compliance with the Electoral Act. He claimed that Nkole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did not score majority of lawful votes cast to be declared winner of the February 23 election. Orji alleged that the election in some areas were either marred by massive irregularities, or failed to hold, and so prayed the tribunal to order a supplementary there. Tribunal chairman Justice Cornelius Akintayo held that the inability of Nkole’s lawyer to prove his allegations of massive irregularities and criminal practices in the election beyond reasonable doubt rendered his petition incompetent and unmeritorious.
