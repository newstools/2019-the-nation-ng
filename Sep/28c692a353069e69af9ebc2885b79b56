The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has lost two federal constituency seats. The election petition tribunal II on Wednesday delivered judgment in favour of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Tribunal Chairman Justice Jennifer Ijohor declared Aniekan Umanah and Pat Ifon winners of the Abak/Etim Ekpo/Ika and Eket federal constituencies. APC’s candidate  Emmanuel Ekon challenged Umanah’s victory while his colleague Kufre Akpabio challenged Ifon’s victory for Eket. In their separate motions, the petitioners prayed the court to cancel the elections on the grounds that it did not comply with the Electoral Act. They asked the tribunal  to nullify the certificates issued to the first respondents on February 23 election. The court held that since it had already determined a motion on that subject by dismissing the petitioners’ application in July 9, the court could not sit on appeal over its decision as sought by the petitioner.
