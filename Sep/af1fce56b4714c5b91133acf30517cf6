Ahead of the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, the Independent National Electoral  Commission (INEC), has begun the ‘training the trainers’ programme on election security. The participants drawn from across the 21 local government areas, include officers of the Nigeria Police, the Army, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and other paramilitary forces. Speaking at the opening of the training session for personnel from Kogi West in Lokoja the state capital, Dr Sa’ad Idris, who was represented by his deputy, Victoria Ettah-Messi, noted that the INEC is not empowered by law to make arrests. She explained that it is the police, in collaboration with other security agencies, that is charged with maintaining law and order on election day. She said: “We cannot conduct an election in an atmosphere that is not peaceful or conducive, but INEC is not charged with keeping the security, and that is why we need you during the conduct of the election, as you will help us conduct free and fair election.” Ettah-Messi called on the participants to do their best in impacting what they have learned on others in their various areas of operation. She commended the European Centre for Electoral Services (ECES), for their efforts in promoting electoral success in Nigeria, noting that the gesture has continued to advance.
