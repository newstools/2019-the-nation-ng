A suspected armed robber was last Saturday arrested by the policemen attached to the Ilemba Hausa Police at a church’s retreat in Ojo, Lagos. The suspect, Wasiu Kamarudeen, 19, a resident of 8, Olaniyi Street, Iyalode in Ilogbo, Ogun State, was said to have gone to the Jakande open field venue of a three-day retreat organised by St. Patrick Catholic Renewal Church, Ojo around 6:20am with three others. It was gathered that members had contacted the police after sighting a motorcycle with registration number Ogun AKM749WP, carrying three suspicious passengers into the retreat ground. Although the passengers mingled with the crowd, policemen deployed were able to apprehend Kamarudeen who allegedly had a locally-made short gun with a live cartridge in his possession. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the policemen recovered the operational motorcycle, adding that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) has been tasked to fish out other members of the gang. A 37-year-old man last Friday allegedly committed suicide in Ikorodu, Lagos over his alleged inability to repay N13,000 debt. Seyi Onayemi, a resident of 7th Avenue, Rofo Estate, Odogunyan, Lagos was said to have taken a poisonous substance suspected to be sniper insecticide inside his room. It was learnt that the man, who left a suicide note, allegedly killed himself as a result of frustration. In the note, the deceased asked his relatives to pay the N13,000 he was owing, lamenting his inability to belong to the elite class as a result of his stubbornness. Homicide detectives were said to have visited the scene, evacuated the body and took the note away.
