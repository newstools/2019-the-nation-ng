Coscharis Motors Nigeria Plc, the exclusive franchise owner of BMW in Nigeria, will reveal the first-ever BMW X7, the pinnacle of BMW’s X Sport Activity Vehicle line-up and a statement of the luxury class at this year’s Banana Island Festival on Saturday. According to Coscharis Group General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Abiona Babarinde, the objective of the event is to offer customers and prospects an opportunity to see and feel the all new BMW X7 within their home and work contexts. Babarinde said: “The BMW X7 becomes the second BMW model to be launched at the Banana Island Cultural festival. The very first was the BMW 5 series in 2017. “The BMW 7 series will be a new definition of automotive luxury,” he further stated. Coscharis Motors BMW Brand Manager Cletus Aregbeshola said the BMW X7 builds on the comfort, handling, safety and technology of all the previous BMW X Sport Activity Vehicle model lines that have been produced at Plant Spartanburg since 1999. “BMW’s latest premium Sports Activity Vehicle is designed to reflect the personality and requirements of the owner. It not only adds a new top model to the X family, but also defines a progressive approach to luxury for the BMW brand,” Aregbeshola said. The X7 offers standard three row seating for seven with optional Second-row Captain’s Chairs offering a more exclusive seating arrangement for six. Standard two-axle air suspension, 21-inch alloy wheels and advanced driver assistance systems ensure that the new BMW X7 lives up to expectations of style, driver engagement, passenger comfort and all-weather and all-terrain capability.
