President Muhammadu Buhari has sent warm greetings to Dr Bolaji S. Ajenifuja, a renowned paediatrician, consultant and academic, on his 90th birthday. In a statement by his Special Adviser (SA) on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President joined family, friends and professional colleagues of the nonagenarian in celebrating the medical doctor who has served the country for 60 years, caring for the poor and rich in rural and urban communities, including families of many past Heads of State. President Buhari hailed Dr Ajenifuja for his sense of purpose and humanitarian spirit in returning to medical school in 1962 to specialise in children’s disease after graduation in 1959. He noted that the academic streamlined his passion to ensure that Nigerian children live and grow healthier. President Buhari expressed appreciation to the paediatrician for his leadership roles in teaching and inspiring younger generation of doctors, especially in his field, and serving in many associations. The President listed these as President of Paediatric Association of Nigeria, Secretary of the Faculty of Paediatric of the Nigeria Medical Postgraduate College for 14 years, and Chairman of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) Board of Governors for 10 years. As the first elected President of Union of African Paediatric Association and Societies and member of the standing committee of International Paediatric Association for many years, the President said, Ajenifuja’s contributions to medical practice in Nigeria and Africa will always be cherished and appreciated by posterity. He prayed that the Almighty God will grant the renowned academic longer life, more strength and good health to still serve humanity.
