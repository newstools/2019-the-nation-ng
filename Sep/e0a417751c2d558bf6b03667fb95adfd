Lagos State House of Assembly member, Mojisola Meranda, has urged residents to dispose waste properly. She spoke at a meeting with stakeholders in her constituency. According to her, the state plans to sensitise the public on how to separate waste that can be recycled. This, she said, will make it easier for waste collectors and recyclers. “At a time like this, when our community is being ravaged by flood as a result of improper disposal of waste, there is urgent need to organise a program like this to sensitise the public on how well to manage waste products,” she said. On how flooding can be reduced, Meranda said the drainages must be cleared. She said once the primary and secondary channels are cleared, flooding will reduce. She said the clearing must be a continuous exercise. “The safety of our environment is the collective responsibility of everyone in the community and should not be left out to the government alone,” she said. Meranda assured that the ninth Assembly would do everything possible within its capacity to bring governance closer to the people. To support less privileged parents, Meranda empowered 1,000 primary school students around Apapa 1 Constituency. She provided them with writing materials, books and mathematical sets. She also presented textbooks and library materials to schools in the community.
