A CHIEFTAIN of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Johnbosco Onunkwo, an engineer, has decried the lack of quality and affordable healthcare delivery services in most rural communities in Anambra State. He regretted that the near absence of quality health facilities had led to periodic deaths among rural dwellers in various communities of the state. Speaking during a free medical outreach programme by his foundation, Johnbosco Onunkwo Foundation in Uga, Aguata local government council area, Onunkwo described health as wealth, stressing that one can only think of what to do to earn a living only when one was healthy. He said, “My foundation deemed it necessary to bring this most important sector to the door steps of these dwellers after being deeply touched by the travails of rural dwellers in accessing quality health care services. “Our people die on daily basis over health issues that can ordinarily be solved if there are quality and affordable healthcare delivery services in our rural areas.” He said the gesture was borne out of love and service to humanity, expressing joy at the turn out of people in the community visited. Onunkwo revealed that the foundation would in few months make in roads into communities in Orumba North and South to complete the old Aguata Union before taking it round the state. “We commenced this in my community, Umuchu many years ago but the positive impact on the people as well as the clamour from neighbouring towns led us to take it to all the towns in the council area,” he noted. Earlier, Consultant physician and Director of the Foundation, Dr. Ejike Ibeanusi said over 600 locals were attended to from each of the communities during the exercise. He said the outreach featured health education, donation of home kits for blood pressure and blood sugar test, free laboratory test and free out-patient consultation and drugs.
