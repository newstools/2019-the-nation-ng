Chelsea’s young star Fikayo Tomori says he’s open to the possibility of committing his International future to the Super Egales. Tomori, who is enjoying a good run of games in Chelsea’s first team, is eligible to play for Nigeria, England and Canada at the national team level. The Chelsea Academy Graduate revealed that decision has not been made concerning his country of choice. “I am a citizen of all three (countries ) so we ’ ll see. I was born in Canada and lived there about seven or eight months old. My family is Nigerian, obviously, I live in England. “It’ s nice to have that. I can ’ t play Under – 21 football anymore so the last international break I didn’t get called up to anyone. Next one maybe we ’ ll see,” The 21- year- old defender was born in Canada to Nigerian parents and currently living in England, the country he represented at the U-21 level. Chelsea Manager Frank Lampard has called on the player to ignore the rumors surrounding his International future and focus on his development at Chelsea. Lampard said: ‘It’s his choice. I wouldn’t tell him where to play internationally.” “But he’s played for [England] Under-21s and if he continues with his form and keeps improving then, of course, I would expect there to be potential for England if Gareth chooses to select him. ‘He shouldn’t worry about it at the minute. “He should just worry about how he’s playing every game or how he trains every day and that will be a nice problem for him, hopefully, if he’s eligible for three. He can choose which one he wants.” Tomori played for Derby County in the Championship last season under Frank Lampard and he won the (POTY) player of the year award with the team where he scored one goal in 44 appearances.
