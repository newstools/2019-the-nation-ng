A 30-year old man, Godstime Ogechi, who specialises in robbing prostitutes in Ugbiyoko, Egor local government area, has been arrested by men of the Edo State Police Command. Ogechi is a one-man gang that uses a rod-like gun to rob call girls on the pretext of paying them to spend the night with him. When he takes them to a dark street, he would bring out the rod and the girls thinking that it is a gun would give him their phones and money including the one he paid them. Luck ran out on him when one of his victims ran away when they got to a dark street at Ugbiyoko area and when Ogechi went back to collect the money he paid her for the night, some girls recognised him which led to his arrest. Speaking to newsmen when he was paraded at the police headquarters, Ogechi said he has lost count of the number of girls he has robbed. According to him, “I don’t have any gang. I operate along Ekenwan road. I pick street girls at night and rob them. I will chat with them and tell them I want to take them for day break. When we get to a dark corner, I will bring out this thing like a gun and threaten them. “They will give me their phones. I cannot remember the number of girls I have robbed. I was caught when one of the girls ran away after I have paid her. I went back to the spot I picked her from and demanded for my money, where she raised alarm.”
