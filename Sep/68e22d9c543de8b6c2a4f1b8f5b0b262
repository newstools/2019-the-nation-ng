THE Federal Government on Tuesday began a three-day workshop aimed at mobilising awareness designed to ensure that victims of oil spill and pollution access the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) fund of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The workshop held at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island was jointly organised by the Nigerian Oil Spill Detention and Response Agency (NOSDRA) and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Global Initiative for West, Central and Southern Africa (GIWACAF). The Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Abubakar, while declaring the workshop open, said the workshop was aimed at drawing attention to the scope and implementation of the IOPC fund, while also focusing on the procedure related to liability and compensation in case of an oil spill. Represented by the Director-General of NOSDRA, Mr. Idris Musa, said the devastating impacts of oil spills on the environment, health and livelihoods of  rural and urban communities, have led to land degradation  and loss of lives. It has also led to destruction of habitats, loss of bio-diversity, incidence of diseases, poor sanitation, loss of livelihoods as well as the depletion of national revenue base.
