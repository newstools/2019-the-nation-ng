In the wake of the lingering face-off between the Police Service Commission (PSC) and the Nigeria Police over the on-going recruitment of 10, 000 constables, the Commission has agreed that all police promotions will be suspended forthwith until further notice, The Nation gathered on Wednesday. A source in the Commission told The Nation that the decision came from a meeting of the Management with the Joint Trade Union Congress of the Commission on Tuesday over the recruitment imbroglio. According to the source, the Union had also demanded that the Commission should withdraw all delegated powers extended to the Inspector General of Police since it has been abused. It was learnt the meeting rose with a Management decision to endorse the demand and stand of the Union that the Commission must seek judicial interpretation of its constitutional mandate for Appointment, which has been at the centre of the dispute. ”The offices of the Commission under lock and key in the wake of the warning strike by the Staff Union have been opened for normal official duties today Wednesday, 25thSeptember 2019, as the Management assured that it would leave nothing to chance in protecting the constitutional mandate of the Commission to appoint, promote and exercise disciplinary control over all personnel of the Nigeria Police Force except the Inspector General. ”Management also assured the staff union that all police officers found culpable in the ongoing dispute will be sanctioned appropriately as they are constitutionally under the disciplinary control of the Commission and cannot hide under any authority to flout the law.” “The Commission appealed for calm and patience it sought final resolution of this avoidable crisis in the recruitment of constables as directed by the President,” the source said. When contacted the Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Mr Ikechukwu Ani, said he would get back to our reporter as he was yet to be briefed.
