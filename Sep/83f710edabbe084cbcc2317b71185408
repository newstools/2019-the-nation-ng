THE Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) on Thursday condemned the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other nationals in South Africa. Addressing reporters in Abuja, NIPR President, Alhaji Mukhtar Sirajo, described the attacks as unjustifiable, callous and a betrayal of the spirit of oneness of Africa. He lamented the fact that the attacks came from a people for whom and by whom the entire continent stood not very long ago, during their hour of need. Sirajo further described xenophobia as a crime against humanity, especially as it runs contrary to the universal values of sanctity of human life, freedom of movement, mutual respect, open engagement, communication and effective relationship management. He commended the Federal Government for the measures it has taken so far in that regard while he called on the government to step up its response to the menace. “Those few involved in dubious activities must desist from such criminal tendencies that could further dent the image of the nation and bring grief to their families when they are caught,” he noted. The NIPR boss also appealed to the South African authorities to be more forthcoming in the handling of the issue, apprehending and meting out appropriate sanctions against those found guilty to serve as a deterrent to others. He said: “The NIPR is worried, like all Nigerians and other right thinking people across the world, at these recurring attacks being perpetrated against Nigerians and other nationals of other African countries in South Africa. “These recurring attacks, which have claimed many lives and destroyed valuable properties, are now sadly being met with many reprisals in other African countries including Nigeria. Xenophobia is a menace. Our world must find a solution to or it will become the albatross of our age.”
