Two men, Felix Okani and Chibuzor Okeke, on Tuesday appeared before an Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State for allegedly breaking into a shop and stealing items worth N4.3 million. Okani, 49, and Okeke, 32, are facing charges of conspiracy, breaking in and stealing. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge. The Prosecutor, Insp.

He said that the defendants stole 5,000 pieces of ribbons, 40 washing grippers for mono block, five control panels for pets, 20 band sealers and seven 10-foot sealers, all valued at N4.3 million. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravene Sections 287, 307, 328 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 stipulates three years’ jail term for stealing, while Section 411 provides for two years’ imprisonment for conspiracy. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adeola Adedayo, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N2 million each with two sureties each in like sum. Adedayo adjourned the case until Oct. 22 for mention. (NAN)
