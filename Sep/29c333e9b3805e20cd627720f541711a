 Nigeria U-23 team Tuesday at the Stephen Keshi Stadium Asaba took their Sudanese counterparts to the cleaners thanks to a 5-0 demolition in front of appreciative fans. The Imama Amapakabo tutored side had lost the first leg by a lone goal in Al-Merreikh with Walaa Eldin Musa’s 45th minute goal making the whole difference. But the return leg turned out to a nightmare for the Sudanese as the Nigerian boys went goal crazy  starting with Taiwo Awoniyi’s 8th minute opener which Leveled aggregate at 1-1. Awoniyi’s goal turned out to be a ginger as Nigeria from then on took charge with Ndifriek Effiong scoring a brace. The team grabbed two more goals to seal the victory at 5-1 aggregate.  The victory hands Nigeria qualification to the Under 23 AFCON in Egypt in November. The tournament in Egypt will be an 8-team championship   with two teams expected to qualify for Tokyo 2020. An elated oach Coach Amapakabo gave kudos to his boys for rising to occasion. The team according to him will not be afraid of any opponent in Egypt adding that the target is to pick Olympic ticket. “I had the full complement of my team and the boys played well and deserved to win.  We will be heading to Egypt with one thing in mind which is to pick Olympic ticket” he enthused.
