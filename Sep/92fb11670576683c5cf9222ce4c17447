THE Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have resolved to work together to grow the oil industry. Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari and MOMAN chairman, Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, made the pledge during the visit of the MOMAN’s executive to the NNPC in Abuja on Wednesday. Speaking during the visit,  the association,  Kyari said statutorily, the corporation was mandated to work with all relevant industry stakeholders to sustain the growth trajectory of the industry as well as ensure energy security of the nation, NNPC’s Acting General Manager, Group Public Affair Division, Mr. Samson Makoji, explained in a statement. He said effective fuel supply and distribution were critical to national growth and energy security, as NNPC, being a national oil company, has an obligation to ensure that petroleum products supply and distribution were carried out unimpeded across the country. He said: “NNPC must work with MOMAN, security agencies and all other relevant stakeholders for the petroleum sector to thrive.  We will work with MOMAN as a partner of choice and we are ready to intervene in issues that will promote the growth of the Industry. By so doing, we will encourage you to continue to grow your investment in the country for the economy to prosper.” The GMD said the Federal Government was determined to ensure that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) pass legislative huddles within the shortest possible time to, among others, reduce the incidences of overlapping roles among agencies of government. He expressed readiness to collaborate with other agencies to address the issues that are of interest to MOMAN to ensure that its members remain a going concern.
