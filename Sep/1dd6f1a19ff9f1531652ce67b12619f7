The office of MTN telecommunications in Minna, the Niger state capital has been closed over fears of reprisal attacks over killings of Nigerians in South Africa. The office, which is located along the Minna-Paiko Road before the ever busy Tunga Market, was said to have been opened in the morning but had to close down at about 10 am. However, most of the shops housing DSTV operators remained open as some of them who spoke to The Nation said they have not received any threat from anybody. They added they have been assured that they can operate in peace. There was also no heavy police presence or postings of policemen to these facilities across the state capital, even in the places said to be flash points. When the MTN office was visited, it was already under lock and key while the neighboring shops explained that the staff had closed for the day.
