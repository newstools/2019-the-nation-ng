Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has urged Nigerians to drop their penchant for foreign goods in favour of made in Nigeria ones, saying that patronising made-in-Nigeria products was necessary to stimulate the growth of the local economy. Briefing reporters, in Lagos, ahead of its 47th Annual General Meeting (AGM), MAN President  Ahmed Mansur said there was the need to develop the national economy through consumption of local goods, especially Nigerian assembled cars. Mansur frowned on the alleged planned purchase of foreign cars worth over N5 billion by the Senate, arguing that if such huge amount was spent for the purchase of locally made brands, it would tremendously impact on the country’s automobile sector. “The planned purchase of vehicles worth over N5 billion by the Senate for official duties would have tremendous impact on local automobile sector. I urge Nigerians to consume what is produced here, as this will impact positively on the local economy,” Mansur advised. MAN, he said, was working hard to improve the value chain in the manufacturing sector and create jobs.   He stressed that this informed the theme of its 47th AGM, “Improving Value Chain in the Manufacturing Sector for Competitiveness and Job Creation.”  According to him, this was borne out of the need to highlight the significance of improving manufacturing value chain linkages as part of efforts to make the sector competitive and contribute more to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and create the much-needed jobs.made-in- Nigeria cars
