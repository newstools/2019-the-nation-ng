Arrangements are on for the conferment of a special recognition award on Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and his wife, Tamunominini, by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Governance Searchlight. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NGO, Otunba Tokunbo Babs-Olurinde, in a statement at the weekend signed by the Publicity Secretary of the organisation , Cornelius Kayode, said following monitoring of the first 100 days of first-term governors in the Southwest, the NGO found Governor Makinde outstanding. She said: “Without doubt, following our research and close monitoring, members of the Governance Searchlight found His Excellency, Governor Makinde, outstanding among his peers in the Southwest and unique in his approach to governance. He has an exemplary style of leadership that we cannot but recognise .” Babs-Olurinde said besides the aforementioned, the governor had excelled in security, health, education, expansion of the economy, workers’ welfare, reconstruction, rehabilitation and renovation of schools through the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and Ministry of Education, among others. She said the feat performed within Makinde’s 100 days at the helm in Oyo State showed that he is a man of the people, who doesn’t only listen to their plight, but also has a large heart and care for their welfare This, she said, would take Oyo State to the next level. Babs-Olurinde said the organisation was proud to associate with the style of leadership of Governor Makinde, hence the special recognition award, “Beacon of Hope for a Greater Nigeria”, to be conferred on him and his wife before the Independence Day celebration.
