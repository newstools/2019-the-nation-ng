Symrise Nigeria has launched its new application laboratories in Lagos with an exclusive tour of the facility recently. The new facility which exists to deepen the company’s presence in West Africa including Nigeria, according to Rudy McLean Managing Director Symrise Nigeria, is to help manufacturers create affordable consumer brands like beverages, toothpaste, cereals, detergents, washing up liquid, beauty products, and personal hygiene products. On what informed the decision to expand to Nigeria, Thomas Dressler, President EAME Fragrances and Oral care said, “Nigeria has a very large economy and we service the everyday needs of people. Even though we have a large sales department here, the products for the Nigerian market were developed outside the country. To serve Nigerians better, we need to be close enough to the Nigerian people and products to understand them and give better-suited products to the Nigerian consumer. That informed our decision.” Symrise has a unique value proposition in the Nigerian market space because most of its clients in the country lack proper application labs to carry out ingredient analysis and testing. With this new facility, not only will clients be able to satisfy their customers at their price-dominated point of need, but they will also be able to develop higher quality products without breaking the bank.
