The Federal Government  has approved the recognition and observance of September 16 of every year as National Identity Day. It said it is in line with the  United Nations (UN) position on  the contribution of dates to the achievement of the purposes of its Charter to promote action on political, social, cultural, humanitarian/human rights issues, This is a move to create awareness among the citizens on the importance of  identification as a modern tool for national development and social cohesion. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha conveyed the approval in a letter dated August 29, 2019 and addressed to the Director-General of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Engr. Aliyu Aziz. In the letter signed on the SGF’s behalf by David K. Gende, the Director, Planning, Research & Statistics in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Mustapha conveyed government’s approval to the NIMC chief executive officer that Nigeria “should join the Coalition for International Identity Day,” in response to the latter’s earlier request. “I am to inform you that the SGF has considered and approved that Nigeria should join the Coalition for International Identity Day, which will recognise the role of identity management for proper planning, governance and efficient service delivery; that the National Identity Management Commission should proceed with educational and awareness campaigns on the proposed identity day to other public and private sector stakeholders including institutions in the movement,” the letter read. By that approval therefore, Nigeria becomes the first country in the world to formally adopt September 16, otherwise called 16.9, as Identity Day (ID-Day). Aziz said already, NIMC has lined up a number of activities to formally launch Nigeria’s Identity Day on September 16, 2019, year being the debut edition.
