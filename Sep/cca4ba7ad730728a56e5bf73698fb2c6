Seventeen-year-old Orhu Abigail Nneka, a Mass Communication undergraduate of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), has won a singing contest organised as part of the activities for the yearly Mass Communication Week. The event, held on the second day of the week-long activities, saw Orhu clinching a N10,000 reward amid encomium from friends and mates. “I feel blessed and it’s God’s grace that found me. Honestly, I’m actually happy for the platform and I’m super excited,” Orhu said. It was excitement galore as various acts thrilled the crowd with their performances during the week themed: “Unleash.” Orhu, a 100-Level undergraduate of the department, recalled how she started her music career while in secondary school because of the passion she has for the profession. President of the department Funke Ademola-Aliu said the Talent Hunt was to showcase various talents in the department, adding that prospective contenders were allowed to pay for air space to showcase their talents. She said: “This is a platform for students, especially the shy ones, to come and showcase their talents. This would help them build their courage to apply for bigger competitions.”
