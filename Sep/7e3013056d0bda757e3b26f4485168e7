Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola has urged Nigerian youth to readdress their leadership potentials as a force in nation building. Fashola’s anniversary lecture was the highpoint of events marking a week-long activity of the 81st anniversary of frontline Lagos club, Ikoyi Club 1938 which comes to a close today with members, families and friends of the club coming together to celebrate in grand style. The evening of winning and dining is a climax of events which kicked off last Saturday, 21st of September with a 7.5km charity walk. According to Fashola in the lecture titled ‘The youths and leadership in nation building,’ “Whether it is the young men, mostly teenagers, who bravely charged at the German forces on the beach of Normandy in June of 1944, to free Europe and the rest of the world from a very mendacious leader; or the young Herbert Macaulay, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe and their ilk, who in the prime of youthfulness, dared to ask, challenge and struggle for independence against British Imperial rule; or the Golden Eaglets who won our first gold in global cadet football in 1985 to be followed by the Olympic medallists of 1996; or those who battled adversity in the desert in the ‘Miracle’ of Damman to set an example of an unflagging and undying Nigerian spirit. It is the youth who have projected the might, resourcefulness and the possibilities of their nations across the world.” Vice chairman of Ikoyi Club 1938 and chairman, anniversary subcommittee, Mustafa Zibiri-Aliu,  said the theme of this year’s anniversary is ‘Building family values’ and is targeted at ensuring that apart from the club achieving global harmony through recreation, members and families are encouraged to see it as a veritable ground for bonding together.
