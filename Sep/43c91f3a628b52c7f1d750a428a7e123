 Super Eagles ace Emmanuel Emenike is determined to help Belgian division two side Westerlo earn promotion. The former Fenerbahçe striker who joined the moderate side on the 16th of this month expressed optimism that with hard work the promotion pursuit will be a dream come true.   He particularly thanked the club for making him feel at home. “Delighted to be back. Thank you Westerlo for making me feel at home and welcome. Let’s get some wins and go for the title. Project Promotion” he enthused. Emenike who scored 19 goals for Fenerbahçe in 69 appearances between 2013 and 2017 is happy to play again after a knee problem initially raised fears that he may be saying goodbye to the game that brought him fame and wealth. Recall that on the last day of the winter transfer window 2018, Emenike agreed to play on loan from Olympiacos to Las Palmas until the end of the season as he had not much playing time in Olympiacos matches. Few days after his signing the Spanish club have announced that Emenike is now being treated for a knee problem and no date has been fixed for his return to action. “An MRI scan was conducted the same night which indicated the presence of an osteochondral lesion at the level of the internal femoral condyle and swelling of the internal lateral ligament,” Las Palmas explained Hope began to rise however on 27 August 2019 as Emenike started trials with Belgian 2nd division outfit K.V.C. Westerlo, for a potential contract and the icing on the cake eventually came with official contract signing on September 16, 2019. Emenike scored nine goals in his 37 appearances for the Super Eagles between 2011 and 2015.
