Former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has urged his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, to sanction the Secretary to the State Government, Uche Onyeaguocha, for giving an illegal order  for his arrest. Governor Ihedioha denied declaring the former governor wanted after many groups condemned the order. A statement by Okorocha’s media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, reads: “Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha was quoted as saying he never ordered the arrest of his predecessor, Senator Rochas Okorocha. This denial, which has been reported in the media, was part of a statement issued by his media aide, Chibuike Onyeukwu, on September 7. “We hail the governor for the denial, having known that the arrest order was uncivilised, disgraceful and embarrassing to the state and every enlightened society, though it came somewhat late; several weeks after the incident happened, thus making it appear belated or an afterthought. “However, the governor could also add fibre to the denial by sanctioning the Secretary to the State Government, Uche Onyeaguocha, who gave the order. When a senior government official in the capacity of Secretary to the State Government makes such disturbing pronouncement, the conclusion is that he has spoken on behalf of the governor and the government; the governor’s long silence is not golden. “If the governor stops at the denial only, the public would still view it like the partial demolition of Akachi Tower which the government also denied authorising, but has failed to arrest those who demolished the edifice 24 hours after his inauguration. “Senator Okorocha is a peaceful man and that was why, throughput his eight years as governor, he never witch-hunted anybody, including those who made themselves his arch opponents.”
