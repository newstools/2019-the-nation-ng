THE Chief Executive Officer, Petrocam Nigeria Limited,  Mr Patrick Ilo, on Tuesday advised fuel marketers to rid themselves of sharp practices in order to grow nation’s oil and gas industry, especially the downstream sub-sector. He said the development would improve profit margins, foster competition among operators, and further contribute to the growth of the economy. Speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of another fuel outlet in OdoEran area of the state,  he said marketers provide direct and indirect jobs for the economy. He said it was imperative for both old and new operators to carve a niche for themselves in the market, urging them to be more transparent in their dealings with customers, in order to increase patronage. Speaking on the backdrop of the closure of 53 filling stations, by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Kaduna, Ilo urged operators to comply with best global practices for growth.
