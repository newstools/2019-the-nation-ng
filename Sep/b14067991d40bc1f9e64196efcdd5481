The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has assured the management of the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), that the permanent building of the institute in Abuja will not be an abandoned project. Gbajabiamila spoke Saturday after he had been conducted round the new NILDS edifice situated along Airport Road in Abuja, by the Director General of the institute, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman. The Speaker expressed the hope that all things being equal, the complex would be completed by the end of December, 2019. “The quality of work is top notch and comparable to the best anywhere in the world. I want to commend the contractors, project managers and the architect. Now I believe that from my little assessment, work is about 70 to 80 percent to completion. It will require a lot of funding. That is what we need to figure out how to complete, so we don’t have another abandoned project in our hands.” He noted that even the layman knows the importance of an institute “such as this.” He opined that the facilities at the institute could be beneficial to lawmakers, research fellows and the country as a whole. He said the country looks forward to the completion of the project which he noted has been on for about 4 years. Director General of the institute, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, while speaking with reporters said that the total estimates on the basis of what is on ground, expectation as regards 2020 budget requirement is being looked into presently.
