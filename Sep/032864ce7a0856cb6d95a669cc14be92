The Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Dr. Akwagaga Enyia, has urged the contractor handling the commission’s 13-floor permanent corpotate headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State to work expeditiously towards early completion of the project. She spoke on Monday during an inspection of the headquarters complex on Eastern By-Pass, Port Harcourt. The NDDC chief, who was accompanied by directors and engineers of the commission, expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of work at the main office building and the ancillary structure. She said: “I am not impressed with what I saw today (yesterday). I am not happy that after all these years, this is the level of work done. I will be here to work, if need be, to ensure that by December, the work will at least get up to 80 per cent. “From time to time, I will be here to do my work. If necessary, I will bring my table and my chair here to work, because we must get value for money. “I will be happy if when paid, the progress made will be exactly the work done. I can assure you that the government is ready to release fund to ensure that the project will be completed as soon as possible.” Enyia also stated that the contractor had assured her that the project would be ready by June next year, declaring that she would hold the contractor to his words.
