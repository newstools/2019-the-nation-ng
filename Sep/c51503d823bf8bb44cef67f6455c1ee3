Chairman of Badagry West Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Lagos state, Hon.

The three victims were identified as Afeez Sanumi, Yinusa Olatunji and Michael Amore In a statement at the weekend, Joseph said: “I appeal for calm among the residents of the area against the shooting of three indigenes. “I condemn the shooting of three people by the customs and appealed to the authority to punish the officer who committed the act. “I would make sure that necessary action was taken to bring the officer who committed the crime to book and appeal to allow peace to reign. “You all should support the government in restriction of movement of contrabands through land border.” The Chairman recalled that the youths recently protested against the nefarious activities of customs officers in the area. “They complained that the customs are entering into their communities, even kitchens to seize rice, their business women, farmers and residents have consistently faced harassment by officers but it was all resolved. “However, it was very painful that just after, a custom officer named Imokhe A.S shoot at two students of Kankon Secondary School and one other with no genuine reasons”. Joseph stated a brief intervention security meeting on the matter was held at the palace of Alapa of Egun Awori Kingdom, noting that the Customs Comptroller and other security agencies were in attendance.
