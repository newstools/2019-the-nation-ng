Filipino world champion Manny Pacquiao is one of the top boxers today. He is known all over the world for his excellent fighting skills and for reaching a tremendous height of success. But he is more than just a boxer. Today, he stands for change and for being a multi-faceted talent who has done well in several other sports. He has also tried his hand at several other fields, like music, and even serving in the army. He won 10 world titles and is the first and only eight-division world champion. Pacquiao achieved the lineal championship titles in four different weight categories. The Senator was also seen promoting the MP BL Dubai Invasion basketball event at Hamdan Sports Complex. The interesting thing about him is that whichever sports ventures into he fits in so perfectly. A politician, Senator, an actor, a boxer, basketballer so many things rolled into one and he keeps looking younger by the day and to say his exploits is having a lot of positive impact on the youths is to put it mildly and they don’t hide their appreciation of him. Avigali Flores a make -up artist while commenting on Gulfnews story on the boxer has this to say ; “Two things that attract me to Manny Pacquiao are his personality and his large heart. Even though he didn’t have much while growing up, he has shown the entire world how people can touch the lives of others. He deserves every bit of praise as he has never shown even an inkling of pride. He treats everyone equal, Pacquiao is simply one of a kind.”
