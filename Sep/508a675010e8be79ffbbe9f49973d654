Nigerians badly affected by the renewed xenophobic attacks in South Africa can access more assistance. The Presiding Pastor, Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has declared he will assist in airlifting more Nigerians willing to return home from South Africa. Suleman’s gesture was made known on Thursday on his verified twitter handle @APOSTLESULEMAN. The cleric said he will pay flight tickets for some Nigerians willing to come home from South Africa. “Just heard 900 Nigerians want to return home from SA. I asked the flight tickets be bought for 20 Nigerians in South Africa who want to return home. “I will take care of the cost. Please register at our church in Johannesburg. We will airlift more by God’s grace. God keep you all alive,” the cleric said in his tweet. The cleric would be joining the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, who volunteered to release aircraft free of charge for evacuation of Nigerians willing to return home. “Air Peace is willing to support the Nigerian Government’s efforts in this matter by deploying our aircraft to evacuate Nigerians back home,” Onyema said. The Chairman of the Air Peace also advised the returnees against making payment to anyone for their flights to Lagos. Air Peace on Wednesday airlifted the first batch of 178 Nigerians back to the country from South Africa.
