To ensure farmers and food  processors produce crops and livestock that meet export standard, the Country Representative, Young Professionals for Agricultural Development (YPARD) Nigeria, Eric Nyikwagh, has called for private sector-driven extension service. At the Agribusiness  Summit held in Abuja, Nyikwagh said in view of the fact that many Nigerians derived their livelihood from farming, and the criticism of government-led agricultural research, dissemination of seeds and other input required capable private sector hands to reach farmers. He stressed that the private sector is seen as an alternative to constrained and largely-ineffective public systems, urging companies, which can provide experts, to assist in galvanising value chains and improving agriculture. According to him, most agro companies are well-resourced to bring cutting-edge research and development, improved seeds and input, and modern information communication technologies to agriculture. He urged the government to invest to attract youths to agriculture. Nyikwagh said there should be efforts to create opportunities for youths, to explore employment in the sector. To him, the industry is strong and growing. He canvassed a campaign to allow more youths to explore the potential in the industry, while helping producers and processors meet their labour needs.
