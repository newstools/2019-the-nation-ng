The statement by AFRICIMIL, which was signed by Abdulaziz Abdulaziz, said it was alarmed over the arrest of its Coordinator, Mr Chido Onumah, this evening, by operatives of the State Security Service (SSS). The stayement said: “Onumah was picked up at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on his return from a trip abroad. “AFRICMIL condemns in strong terms the unjustifiable arrest of Onumah and demands his immediate and unconditional release. “Waylaying law-abiding citizens should not be turned into the preoccupation of an entire security outfit.”
