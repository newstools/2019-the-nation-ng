The police in Akwa Ibom State have arrested and detained a 35-year man, Idorenyin Essien, for allegedly burning his son to death. The Nation gathered that he allegedly took the action after accusing his son of stealing N500 from a neighbour. The incident reportedly occurred in Eket Local Government. Police spokesman Odiko Mac-Don Achibe said the incident happened last Friday at Afia Nsit community in Eket. He did not give the name of the deceased, but said Essien was arrested in his home at Afia Nsit by the operatives on patrol. Achibe said the suspect would be arraigned after investigation. Mr. Effiong Okon, a community leader in Afia Nsit, alleged that Essien burnt his son to death after accusing him of stealing N500 from a neighbour to buy food. He alleged that Essien’s son, a minor, stole N500 from a neighbour’s house to buy food and when the father returned, the neighbour reported the matter to him. Okon said the father refunded the money and slammed his son. He alleged: “The father later sent the boy to buy kerosene for him and he innocently ran to buy the item, not knowing that the father intended to use the kerosene to burn him to death.” Okon alleged that the father called his son out of the house, tied him with a rope, poured the kerosene on him, struck a match and watched him burning. “The father tied his son’s hands and legs and ‘set him ablaze’ in front of his house at Afia Nsit in Eket,” he alleged. Okon said the boy was taken to hospital by sympathisers, but he eventually died, adding that the community alerted the police, which prompted the man’s arrest.
