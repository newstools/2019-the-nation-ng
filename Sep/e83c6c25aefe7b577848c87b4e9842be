LAGOS State Government has threatened to revoke housing scheme contracts with private partners unless they delivered within the stipulated time. Commissioner for Housing Moruf Akinderu-Fatai said this yesterday during a meeting with the private sectors partners and joint venture investors at Alausa, Ikeja. Akinderu-Fatai lamented that many investors have not complied with the timeframe stipulated in their contract agreements. “Many of the private partners have not met up with the timelines thereby littering the state with many uncompleted housing schemes and causing delays in actualisation of government’s mandate. “All housing schemes that had been contracted out to private sector partners and joint investors are to be completed within the time-frame indicated in the contractual agreements or have them cancelled,” he warned. Earlier, the participating investors cited encumbrances, disappointments from funding partners and conflicts with various host communities as major difficulties faced. Akinderu-Fatai in his response advised the investors to prove their capabilities and justify the government’s confidence through working out solutions to these challenges. “While the government will do its best to intervene in some of the situations, we expect every investor to have engaged in self-audit before coming forward to take up the responsibilities of state housing scheme,” he said. According to him, the need to bridge the housing deficit is urgent and cannot wait till eternity to be solved. He reaffirmed government’s determination to make more Lagosians homeowners within the next two years, adding “we are committed to delivering our mandate in ensuring that more Lagosians gain access to homeownership irrespective of their ethnicity or political dispensation within the next 24 months. The completion of all ongoing housing schemes is a major strategy which the state intends to deploy in meeting its target.
