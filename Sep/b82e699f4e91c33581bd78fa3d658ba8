Sujimoto Construction Company has won the 2019 Bold Initiative in Property Development award by the Nigerian Institute of Architects. This is coming barely 30 days after the company was awarded the Luxury Developer of the Year 2019 at the Nigerian Business Leadership Awards, a globally acknowledged award which is annually hosted by Business Day newspaper. Speaking during the award, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Sujimoto, Mr. Sijibomi Ogundele,  said the award was given for their ability to outpace peers and engage in world-class, high quality luxury real estate development. He said lessons he learnt in his childhood were instrumental to his success. According to him, “Five years ago, when we started, some said our dreams were too big, our ambitions too grand; but we refused to think small and act local, we chose to think big and act global. By embracing the spirit of possibility, we created our own destiny. We understand that there is no nobility in poverty and to win in today’s economy, one needs an uncommon balance of integrity, creativity and quality. Our sold-out project, the GiulianoBySujimoto, was erected on these tenets. We defied the norm in real estate industry and constructed super terraces with private elevators wrapped in Spanish travertine stones. With our current project, the LucreziaBySujimoto Development, we are suspending villas in the sky and will be the first to adopt the Glass Reinforced Concrete (GRC) for our facade.” To emerge as the winner, Sujimoto Construction was screened alongside other eminent and well-respected companies by a jury of recognised foreign and local researchers.
