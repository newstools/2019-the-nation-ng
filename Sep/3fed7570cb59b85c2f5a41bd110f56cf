 Former international Francois Omam Biyik is back in Cameroon coaching crew after he was announced as Deputy to surprise Head coach Toni Conceicao. It is the second return for Omam Biyik who was assistant to Javier Clement from 2010-11. The Sports Ministry announced Saturday the appointment of Portuguese coach Toni Conceicao to take over from Clarence Seedorf who was sacked after the 2019 Nations cup in Egypt where the Indomitable Lions crashed out in the round of 16 losing 3-2 to Super Eagles of Nigeria A brief statement announced the appointment but remained silent on the terms of contract offered the 57 year old Portuguese who has handled 16 different coaching posts in the last 15 years. This however is the first time the former CFR Cluj and Bragga coach will be handling a national team. The coach who has been in and out of CFR Cluj began his third spell with the side on July 26 2018 but was sacked eight months later following a run of three games without a win. His initiation match with the Indomitable Lions will be on October 12 when he is expected to face 2019 Nations cup fourth place finishers Tunisia in an international friendly at the Rades Stadium.

Some analysts believe the experience of Omam Biyik will be useful additions to what Conceicao is bringing to the table. Omam Biyik scored the goal that saw Cameroon beat holders Argentina in the opening game of the 1990 World Cup in Italy and reach that historical quarter-final place. He also played at the 1994 and 1998 finals. Soccer fans in Nigeria will remember Omam Biyik, now 53 in the 1990 World cup qualifiers where Nigeria needed just a draw to head to the world cup but it was Oman Biyik who scored the only goal that dashed that dream in the 31st minute in Younde. As a coach he has handled clubs in Gabon, Mexico and Togo.
