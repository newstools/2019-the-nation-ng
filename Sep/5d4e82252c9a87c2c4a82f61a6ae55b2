A 49-year-old driver, Dauda Waheed, was at the weekend arraigned at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly assaulting his 62-year-old neighbour, her daughter and another over unpaid electricity bills. Waheed, who lives at 1, Dada Street, Bariga, Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of assault. He, however, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Oriabure told the court that the defendant committed the offences at 8:30pm on August 31, at 1, Dada Street, Bariga, Lagos. According to him, the defendant had returned home drunk and started accusing his neighbours of staging a fight with his wife over unpaid electricity bills. He said the complainants: 62-year-old Mrs. Wosilat Amusa, her 27-year-old daughter, Miss Olaide Amusa, and their neighbour, Mr. Sola Ojo, tried to explain the electricity situation to him, but he assaulted them. Oriabure alleged that the defendant threw the older Amusa on the floor, thereby causing a serious injury on her left leg, and punched her daughter on the face for trying to help her mother. He alleged that when Ojo intervened, he also punched him on his left eye, before other neighbours intervened and held him down. Magistrate E. N. Ojuromi admitted the defendant to N50,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and live within the court’s jurisdiction. Ojuromi said the sureties must have their addresses verified by the court and show evidence of three years tax payments to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned till October 2.
