The Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday adjourned till October 24 the N179 billion fraud trial of the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of defunct Intercontinental Bank Plc, Dr Erastus Akingbola. The trial, which began with Akingbola’s first arraignment 10 years ago, could not continue following Justice Mojisola Olatoregun’s absence. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), in 2009, arraigned Akingbola on an alleged 26-count fraud charge before Justice Charles Archibong, but the judge struck out the charges, citing lack of diligent prosecution. On appeal, the decision was overruled and Akingbola was ordered to return to the Federal High Court for his trial. The Court of Appeal’s decision was affirmed at the Supreme Court. The EFCC re-arraigned Akingbola before Justice Olatoregun on March 12 on an amended 22-count N179 billion fraud charge. In the charge, the anti-graft agency alleged that while Akingbola was the MD and Chief Executive Officer of Intercontinental Bank Plc, he used N179,385,000,000 belonging to the bank for “fictitious transactions”. The commission also claimed that Akingbola used N179 billion to buy Intercontinental Bank Plc’s shares, thereby inflating the market price of Intercontinental Bank shares on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). In another instance, the EFCC alleged that Akingbola took £1.3 million from Intercontinental Bank Plc’s GBP NOSTRO account at Deutsche Bank, London, and remitted same into the bank account of Fuglers Solicitors with the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, London. It further claimed that the £1.3 million was paid to Fuglers Solicitors for the purpose of buying a property in the name of Life Boat Settlement Trust, which Akingbola set up. The EFCC said Akingbola knew the £1.3 million to be proceeds of crime, “to wit: stealing”. Akingbola pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
