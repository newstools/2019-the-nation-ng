Super Eagles technical adviser Gernot Rohr has lost his mother, Madam Elisabeth Rohr on Thursday. She was 97. Rohr guided the senior national team to a pulsating 2-2 draw against Ukraine in Tuesday’s international friendly game at the Dnipro Arena. The news of Rohr’s mother demise was confirmed via the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) twitter handle @Thenff on Thursday. It reads: “We commiserate with @NGSuperEagles Head coach, Mr. Gernot Rohr who just lost his mother Madam Elisabeth Rohr. She was 97. May her soul rest in peace.” The news would come as a shock to the German tactician, who helped Nigeria to claim a bronze medal at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
