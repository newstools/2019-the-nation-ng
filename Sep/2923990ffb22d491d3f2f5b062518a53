The General Manager of the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency (PPA), Mr. Fatai Idowu Onafowote, has said the agency has begun the implementation of e-Tendering, e- Publishing/Notification, e-Bidding and e-Award modules of  e-Procurement Solution. The implementation of the four new e-Procurement Solution Modules, he said, began with three ministries – Health, Education and Works and Infrastructure. Onafowote added that the introduction of the e-procurement solution modules was aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability and contributing to the ease of doing business by existing and potential contractors of the government and its MDAs. With the implementation of the e-Procurement Solution Modules, registered and would-be contractors, he said, no longer have to visit the ministries for papers submission, “because a platform for official communication and interaction to facilitate the procurement process has been provided online.” Onafowote said some of the procurement officers had undergone the requisite training to ensure a seamless implementation of the new policy, while others would also be exposed to similar training in due course.
