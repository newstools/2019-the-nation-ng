Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA) has commended Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led Enugu State government over its current initiatives aimed at tackling insecurity and has therefore called on all the other Southeast states to emulate the state. The Secretary-General of the Assembly, Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, told The Nation yesterday, that “Ugwuanyi’s current effort to tackle insecurity is “a demonstration of seriousness.” As he puts it on behalf of the Assembly, “The demonstration of seriousness to combat insecurity and checkmate rogue herdsmen head on, by the government of Enugu State, is commendable. “The tight structure of the newly created forest guards and the radio equipment provided them is assuring. “The immediate recruitment of thousands of able bodied young people, equipped with brand new vehicles and autobikes is comforting.” Uko also said ECA is “also happy to note that all over the state, the people’s mood has changed from fear and trepidation to gladness and hope. We therefore plead with the other sister-states to copy immediately, in order to secure our region from blood thirsty killers, who we believe will find it extremely difficult to terrorise our communities anymore,” he said.
