A group of seven visual artists are on display at the Alexis Galleries, Lagos at the moment.  The outing is aptly titled brilliance where painters, sculptors and potters are showcasing an array of beautiful art works that depict different aspects of myriad of issues that pertain to the society.  The exhibition which opened yesterday will run till Saturday, October 5th. The artists include Ato Arinze, Luke Osaro, Busayo Lawal, Patrick Agose, Paul Ayokhai, Chuks Okonkwo and Moses Ibanga.  According to Mrs. Patty Chidiac-Mastrogiannis, owner of Alexis, “These are new set of the next masters whose brilliant works show class and exceptional dexterity.  You can see that their works are not only outstanding, they are deep and beautiful”. With this statement, the works indeed depict artists who rummage through social and everyday nuances of man to produce their works.  This is why part of the proceeds from the exhibition will go to Sought After, a foundation designated to the wellbeing of women and children.  “I love donating to such foundations”, Mastrogiannis noted. The artists each came with a number of works.  Ato, a potter, has seven works, while Okonkwo produced five paintings made out of recycled saw dusts.  In their own cases too, Osaro is showcasing six sculpted works, Lawal eight, and Agose, a sculptor also provided four works.  Also Ayokhai came with eight works one of which dwells on the passage of life, man’s journey through life. Together the works bought their glow into the lifewire of contemporary Nigerian world as they exhibit at Alexis at moment.
