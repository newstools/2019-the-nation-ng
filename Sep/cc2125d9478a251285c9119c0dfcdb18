The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has recovered $690,400 and N550,692,362 from some suspects in Kano State. The money was reportedly recovered between January and August. The commission’s Acting Chairman Ibrahim Mustapha Magu, stated this through the Head of the Kano Office, Akaninyene Ezima, at a media briefing in Kano. A statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, said Ezima revealed that the zone was also focusing on cybercrime through intelligence gathering and collaboration with other agencies across the world. He said: “In this zone, we are developing a lot of intelligence to ensure that we combat this menace. Of course, we are sending a word of warning. The world has become a global village and these days law enforcement is not limited by national borders. “So, there are collaborations between the commission and other law enforcement agencies in the world. As a result of such collaborations, several arrests have been made and we in the Kano Zonal Office will make sure we deliver on this mandate and stamp out the scourge of cybercrime. “I want to advise members of the public not to disclose their bank details to anybody because we often receive unsolicited phone calls, emails, asking us for our banking information. There is no bank or financial institution that will call you and ask for your banking details.” Ezima explained that scams are mostly perpetrated at weekends when fraudsters know that it would be difficult for victims to contact their banks. The EFCC officer also cautioned the public against the prevalence of Ponzi and other “get-rich quick” schemes.
