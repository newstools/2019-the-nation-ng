THE Minister of State, Niger Delta Affairs, Festus Keyamo (SAN), has assured that justice will be served to the victim of a broken bottle attack, Mr. Elvis Omoiro, who was stabbed over a political disagreement in Effurun, Uvwie council area of Delta State. Keyamo, who is a native of the area, also disclosed that he has reached out to the police in the area to ensure the suspect is fished out. He revealed this via his Twitter handle yesterday, adding that he had demanded that the medical bills for the victim’s treatment be directed to him for payment. Omoiro was reportedly stabbed on various parts of his body by his neighbour, Best Uduophori, for allegedly celebrating the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. Uduophori, who is alleged to be a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and a bar owner around Okoloba area of the city, is currently at large. However, the incident, which has caused uproar in the media and political space, drew the attention of the Niger Delta Minister, Keyamo. He tweeted, “I have already taken up this matter. I sent one of my SA’s to the hospital and asked them to send me all the medical bills. “I also spoke with the victim and assured him of justice. I then contacted the DCO of Ekpan Police Station to ensure the culprit is arrested and brought to book.”
