Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) has urged politicians to desist from comments capable of undermining peace and stability in the country. Its National Publicity Secretary, Kunle Famoriyo, said in a statement that comments by some Northern All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders on zoning were an invitation to anarchy. The group said it was unthinkable to change the goal-post in the middle of a match. ARG warned such comments amounted to an attempt to deny the South the legitimate right to produce the next president in 2023. The group said: “What is good for the goose is also good for the gander, what we are interested in is fairness, equity and justice for the south and the north that co-jointly formed the country, with no undue favour for one against the other.” ARG wondered why politicians  always failed to learn from political history. The group recalled how political leaders took insensitive decision on the June 12, 1993 p[residential election won by the late Chief Moshood Abiola that plunged the country into deep crises. ARG said that, in the face of the fragile unity in which the country has found itself and the threat of break-up, zoning of political offices is the only force that can preserve the unity. It added that undermining zoning was an indirect attempt to undermine the fragile unity, warning that the outcome would not benefit any region.
