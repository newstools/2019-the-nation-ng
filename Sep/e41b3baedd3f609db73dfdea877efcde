The first batch of 320 Nigerians for evacuation from South Africa aboard Air Peace Airlines is expected to arrive the Murtala Muhammed International Airport on Wednesday, Chairman of the airline Mr Allen Onyema has disclosed. The returnees, Onyema said, will touch down at the cargo wing of the Lagos Airport in collaboration with the airport and other security agencies. He said the first batch is part of the over 700 Nigerians so far captured to be brought back home by the indigenous carrier. Speaking in a telephone interview in Lagos, Onyema said the carrier has secured the necessary approvals from the relevant aviation and other authorities in Nigeria and South Africa for the exercise.
