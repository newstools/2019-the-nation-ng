Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is committed to actualising the vision of making Lagos one of the top five African cities of choice to invest, live, work and recreate as a tourist destination, Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle has said. She spoke at the opening ceremony of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) annual training for union members with the theme: “Labour Leadership: Growth, Opportunities and Challenges”. It was held in Ikeja, Lagos. Ponnle, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Office of Establishment and Training, Mr. Abiodun Bamgboye, said the present administration is resolute to build a greater Lagos anchored on inclusiveness, shared vision, prosperity, investment in people, safe environment and eco-friendly infrastructural development. She said the Sanwo-Olu administration is deploying the T.H.E.M.E.S. (Transportation and Traffic Management, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism, Security and Governance) agenda as its strategic thrust for service delivery, stressing that the outcome is better quality of life and improved standard of living for the residents. Mrs. Ponnle hailed the union for the annual training of members, saying it was educative and informative. She said the labour leadership, like any other, must be better equipped with skills, knowledge, competence and attitude to manage followers in a more creative and productive manner. The commissioner said as a strategic partner with the labour centres and trade unions, her ministry looked forward to a more robust and rewarding government- labour relationship. TUC Lagos State chapter Chairman Comrade Gbenga Ekundayo said the essence of the training was to change members’ minds from the old ways of doing things to better opportunities that would not conflict with the fundamental purposes of trade unionism.
