Imagine not knowing how to spell the state you come from. But that was what played at the Big Brother Naija ‘Pepper Dem’. Housemates were tasked by Biggie to celebrate themselves by painting the walls with unique and memorable designs of their choice. Tacha, a self-acclaimed Port Harcourt first daughter, then designed the wall but she missed out on the ‘o and u’ in the oil-rich city. She also missed the ‘h’ after “g” in daughter, forcing fans to launch scathing attacks against her. Elozonam took a look at Tacha’s painting on the wall and wondered if Tacha’s spelling of ‘Port Harcourt’ was correct. When he turned to Seyi to ask, Seyi quickly told him he was asking the wrong person. When they looked at her spelling of ‘daughter’, they burst into laughter at how letter ‘h’ was positioned. In what they termed ‘creative save’ these two had a good laugh about Tacha’s spelling. The Pepper Dem Housemates are in the business of catching cruise with one another.
