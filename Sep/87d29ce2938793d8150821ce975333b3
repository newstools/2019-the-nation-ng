THE Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting will not hold today, it was learnt last night. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the postponement is due to the fact that all the memoranda earlier submitted to the Council for consideration had been returned to the various ministries. “This action will allow ministers, who were recently sworn in, to have their inputs in the memoranda sent by their predecessors in office,” the statement said. It added that the period would enable the ministers, who are still taking briefs from bureaucrats in the ministries and familiarising themselves with their work space, to have more time to contribute to discussions at the meeting. “They will also utilise the period of the break to work towards the early preparation and submission of the 2020 budget estimates,” the statement also said.
