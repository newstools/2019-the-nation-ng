Popular Nigerian singer Timi Dakolo is yet to get over the alleged report of being denied US visa after his asylum bid in UK failed. Timi Dakolo took to his Instagram on Monday. The singer, who posted pictures of visiting the Metropolis Studios, wrote. “I know that it is Monday and it is not the best day to do this but please can someone tag Mummy the best investigative journalist in Africa and ask her respectfully, Mummy I thought you said they rejected Timi Dakolo’s visa application and you even printed the paper. How come he is in London?” It will be recalled that the singer reacted on his Twitter account denying the allegation, saying his visa to the mentioned countries were still valid. He wrote: “I swear I didn’t know they denied me visa. Please, let me check my passport again whether my visas to the mentioned places have expired. Wow! they are still valid. “Maybe it is another Timi Dakolo. Mad people everywhere,” he added. This is coming after a report by Nigerian journalist Kemi Olunloyo that the Dakolos were trying hard to leave the country in the middle of a rape case with Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA).
