Residents in some communities in Ogbia, the Local Government Area of former President Goodluck Jonathan, have been rendered stranded following the collapse of a major bridge in their area. It was gathered that the only bridge connecting Emeyal and Kolo and Jonathanâ€™s Otuoke community collapsed and cut off the area.
