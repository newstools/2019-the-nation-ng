The police in Imo State have arrested a couple and four others for stealing and selling two siblings for N900,000. The state’s Police Commissioner, Rabiu Ladodo, said the command had recovered one of the stolen children, Promise Opunwa, 2, while his elder sister, Oluma, 4, was still missing. Parading the suspects before newsmen, Ladodo who gave the names of the suspects as Chika Obi,28 and Chiamaka Obi, described the deal as absurd, saying that the infant was recovered at Uli in Anambra State. Ladodo said other members of the syndicate, include Ogidi Chukwuma, 26; Anuforo Ogechi, 28; Ebere Okafor,45, and Chioma Ngobiri, 46. He said: “On August 4, three members of the syndicate invaded the house of one Ijeoma Opunwa and inflicted machete cut on one Daberechi Okafor who was present at the time of the invasion.” “They instilled fear on other occupants and made away with two children, Oluma (4), and Promise (2) to an unknown destination. They robbed them of their phones and undisclosed amount of money.” The CP said his men carried out diligent investigation and arrested the suspects at their hideout in Umulololo in Okigwe Local Government Area. “The suspects confessed to the crime and even led operatives to Onitsha through Uli in Anambra State where their gang members one Ebere Okafor and Chioma Ngobiri were arrested and one of the stolen children, Promise ,2, was recovered. “ Ladodo assured that the remaining missing child would be recovered. One of the suspects, Ogidi, he said admitted that he got N130, 000 from the shady transaction.
