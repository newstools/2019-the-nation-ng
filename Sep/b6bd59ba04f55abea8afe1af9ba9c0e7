The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency has said the rise in water level of River Benue may increase the likelihood of river flooding in Adamawa, Taraba and Benue states. Director- General of the agency, Clement Nze, said this at an ongoing press conference in Abuja, the nation’s capital. He said water from six out of the eight countries that make up the Niger Basin Authority has arrived Nigeria as at today.

Other states likely to be affected by the river flooding are: Edo, Anambra, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa. Details shortly…..
