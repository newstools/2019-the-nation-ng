German coach Gernot Rohr is unfazed about the Super Eagles fall in the FIFA ranking released on Thursday. Despite playing 2-2 against Ukraine in an international friendly early this month, the Eagles dropped from 33 from 34 but remained the third in Africa behind Senegal and Tunisia. However, Rohr admitted that it would be difficult to gain points from playing a match unlike other countries that played two matches during the international break. “Yes, we played only one match in Ukraine and others played twice in the same period… Even if we play just one against Brazil next month, It will be difficult to take us higher,” he told NationSport. Senegal hold on to top spot in Africa and they remain 20th while Tunisia remains 29th in the world to be second best team in Africa. Belgium remain top of the ranking after an action-packed number of weeks in international football which saw 78 friendlies, 74 continental qualifiers and 60 FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 qualifiers take place. Though the teams in the top ten remain unchanged, there has been some movement. France (2nd, up 1) and Brazil (3rd, down 1) have traded places, while Spain (7th, up 2) are the top ten’s biggest movers.
