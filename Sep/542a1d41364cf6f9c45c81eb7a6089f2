The Lagos State Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle, has urged the ministry workers to be determined to change the negative attitude associated with civil servants. She spoke on Tuesday at the opening session of a strategic retreat organised for heads of units and departments in the departments and agencies under the supervision of the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions, in Alausa, Ikeja. Ponnle, who recalled the dignifying nature of public service in the past, said all hands must be on deck to revert to the good old days when people were willing and anxious to be identified with government institutions. She said the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration has a laudable plan to make Lagos a 21st century economy in consonance with T.H.E.M.E.S. (Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism, and Security and Governance), adding that “the governor has enjoined the ministry to support this mandate, develop plans and policies to ensure this is driven by a 21st century-enabled workforce.” The commissioner said the coming together of the ministry’s officials comprising those from the Office of Establishments and Training, Lagos State Pensions Commission (LASPEC), Public Service Staff Development Centre (PSSDC) and Civil Service Pensions Office (CSPO) was aimed at sharing a combined vision and pursuing their mandates with uniformity and in consonance with the project T.H.E.M.E.S. ”Our aim as a ministry, working in partnership with other relevant MDAs, is to ensure the engine of governance, which is driven by its people, working efficiently and effectively to ensure the plans become our collective reality,” Ponnle said.
