THE Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Awka in Anambra State, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, has advised politicians to give the people quality governance or face the wrath of hungry and angry Nigerians. The cleric said what happened in Nuremberg, Germany (the attack on former Senate Deputy President Ike Ekweremadu) was a pointer to the fact that Nigerians were fed up with bad governance from politicians. Delivering a homily on Tuesday during his maiden pastoral visit to St. James Catholic Church, Neni, Aniocha Local Government Area of the state, Ezeokafor said Nigerians had the right to protest against perceived injustice. He said: “Germany’s experience will be a child’s play compared to what is to come in the nearest future, if the current crop of political leaders fail to sit up and work for the collective interest of all Nigerians. “Nigerians have the right to protest against injustice, maladministration, misappropriation of public funds, poor representation, embezzlement and inhuman treatment, provided they were not armed.” Ezeokafor, who noted that the humiliation of bad leaders was long overdue, predicted a revolution and manhandling of greedy and insensitive politicians, if urgent steps are not taken to turn things around for the populace. He added: “Nigerians are hungry and angry. You cannot beat a child and stop him from crying. It is unacceptable. It is done all over the world. Once something is not going on well, you reserve the right to speak up. People have the right to voice out their grievances.” “I think what the political class should do to douse the tension is to face governance and law-making squarely and work for the common good of the masses. “I see more and more greedy politicians being manhandled. Nigerians are dying daily because of bad governance. There are no good roads, no healthcare, no electricity. The cost of living is so high. Yet, these people are busy siphoning our common patrimony.”
