 Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is relieved to finally have an opportunity to try his boys and call the shots as national team coach. Ntseki who has been Assistant to the various coaches that handled Bafana Bafana in the past, was recently appoint the head coach following the departure of Stuart Baxter shortly after the Nations Cup in Egypt. An international friendly between South Africa and Zambia which should have served as the first outing for the new coach fully in charge, was cancelled following the outbreak of xenophobic attacks in the Rainbow Nation. Madagascar who stepped in as replacement again cancelled the deal at the 11th hour, but Molefi Ntseki has now released a 23-man team to tackle the Eagles of Mali in the Mandela challenge billed for Sunday October 13 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. In 2013 the Super Eagles piped Bafana Bafana 2-0 to win that year’s edition at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, with Uche Nwafor accounting for the two goals. The first half had ended goalless but changes made by the late Super Eagles coach Stephen Keshi who  brought in Victor Moses for Sunday Mba,  Ahmed Musa for Obinna Nsofor and Uche Nwafor for Shola Ameobi paid off three minutes into the second-half. Molefi Ntseki will not only be hoping that the team wins against Mali but  will also be using the match as part of his shape up games going into the 2021 Nations cup qualifiers.
