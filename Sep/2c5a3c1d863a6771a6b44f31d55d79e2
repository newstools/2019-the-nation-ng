The Nigerian Army Resource Centre (NARC) and the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) have brought stakeholders together to address terrorism, insurgency and electoral violence. Chief of Army Staff Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai hailed the initiative, which will enable stakeholders formulate strategies to counter insecurity. Gen. Buratai pledged that the Army would uphold the territorial integrity of Nigeria in line with its oath of allegiance. He said officers were deployed across the country to assist the police in peace-keeping. The Army chief noted that significant progress had been made in ensuring that lives were secured, particularly in the Northeast, where Boko Haram insurgents had been denied territories. “The Nigerian Army understands and fully subscribes to the fact that in keeping the peace either at the national or global level, troops must carry out their tasks in line with extant rules of engagement. “Where there are infractions or violations of human rights of the citizens, appropriate disciplinary measures are applied. This is aimed at upholding and maintaining the trust and confidence of the populace as well as the dignity and professionalism of the army,” he said. Buratai said the initiatives of agencies involved in tackling these challenges required understanding by stakeholders. “I will, therefore, like to commend NEPAD for its strong advocacy for peace, security and safety for all persons in the country which has helped to bring about relative peace and economic growth. “I also wish to commend the NARC for its laudable efforts toward achieving its core mandates of finding research-based solutions to security and defence challenges, which have attracted this collaboration with NEPAD,” he added. The two-day summit has the theme: ‘Terrorism, Insurgency and Incidence of Electoral Violence in Nigeria: Role of Security Agencies’.
