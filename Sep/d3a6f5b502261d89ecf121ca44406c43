Enugu Rangers have picked a ticket to the playoffs round of the CAF Confederation Cup competition after they squeezed through 4-3 on aggregate in Enugu over AS Pelican of Gabon. The Flying Antelopes were beaten 2-1 in Libreville two weeks ago but they overturned the first-leg deficit in style at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu yesterday. The game began on an uninspiring note for the seven times Nigerian champions when they allowed the visitors to take an early lead through Dertin Amores in the fourth minute. Rangers raised the bar almost immediately and they were rewarded with the equalizing goal in the 18th minute through Ifeanyi George. The Flying Antelopes tried to increase the tally before the halftime but their patience was rewarded in the 50th minute when Nnamdi Egbujor scored his second goal in the competition for Rangers. The remaining Nigerian club in the second-tier club competition ensured there won’t be any comeback for the Gabonese side when Ibrahim Olawoyin netted the third goal in the 57th minute to throw the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium into frenzy. The Gabonese went in  search of the second goal that could have seen them sneak into the final round at the expense of Rangers but the Nigerian team’s defence was rock solid for the remainder of the game.
