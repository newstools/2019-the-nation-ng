Life, they say, is what one makes of it. A condition that drives one man into frustration and even attempted suicide would be made so light by another man that it would become a source of hysteric laughter. Consider the case of former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki and his supporters in Kwara State and you would realise the sense in the Yoruba saying that there is good in evil and evil in good. Still smarting from the crushing defeat of Saraki’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the rampaging machinery of the All Progressives Congress in virtually all the positions contested in the recently concluded elections in the state, the immediate past Senate President and his supporters have found a formula for getting over the humiliating defeat. The refrain on the lips of members of Saraki’s political camp in Kwara State these days is that they have proceeded on a four-year leave after the strenuous task of governing the state for 16 unbroken years, and would be making a return to the Government House in 2023. While the supporters of APC in the state are sneering at Saraki and his supporters over the refrain which they see only as an ingenuous way of mitigating their pains, PDP supporters in the state are praying that the purported leave would not turn into retirement, given the pace at which Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s government is moving.
