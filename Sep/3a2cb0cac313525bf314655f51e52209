The training facilities of Boko Haram Terrorists in northern Borno have been destroyed by air raids, the Nigerian Air Force said on Friday. According to the spokesman of the Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, the facilities were located in Mallam Fatori in the fringes of Lake Chad. Daramola explained in a statement that terrorists who were occupying the facilities were also neutralized. He said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has recorded another major feat with the destruction of an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) training camp near Mallam Fatori on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno Sate. “The operation was executed on September 10, 2019, based on credible intelligence reports and confirmatory Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions that identified a building on one of the Lake Chad islands that was being used by the terrorists as a facility to indoctrinate and train new fighters. “The ATF therefore dispatched its aircraft to attack the location, which upon arrival over the target area observed significant activity of the terrorists. “The attack aircraft scored devastating hits on the building completely destroying it and neutralizing the ISWAP occupants. “The few other fighters seen fleeing the location were mopped-up by follow-on attacks.”
