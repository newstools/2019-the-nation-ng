HEAD Coach of Nigeria’s beach soccer team, Super Sand Eagles, Audu Adamu says the team has all it takes to beat Brazil, Portugal and Oman in the group stage of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup scheduled to hold in Asunción, Paraguay from November 21 to December 1. Nigeria will begin her campaign against Portugal on November 22, play Oman on November 24, before facing Brazil in Group D’s final match two days later on the grounds of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, Luque. Adamu told NationSport noted that the team would only be able to achieve their dream in Paraguay by surpassing the quarter final achievement recorded at the 2006 and 2007 editions, if given adequate preparation and well taken care of just like the other national teams. “Brazil are the world champion and have won the title five times and Portugal have won it too, but Nigeria have beaten Brazil 9-4 in 2011 at the Copa Lagos, no African team achieved that feat. Two months ago, Senegal lost 6-1 away to Portugal. “We are not going to the World Cup for going sake. We want to make a statement in this World Cup, but how can we do it? Early preparation will give us the confidence to stand against any team. We are the only national team going to the World Cup in November as others have attended their World Cup.”
