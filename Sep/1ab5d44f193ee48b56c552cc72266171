 Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic turned down a huge £7million-a-year offer to play in Qatar as he has not given up on his dream move to Manchester United. United are struggling for goals and could re-open negotiations for the Croatian veteran in January. Mandzukic appeared destined for Old Trafford in the summer along with fellow star Paulo Dybala but the move collapsed when the Argentine refused to move to the Premier League. Ole Gunnar Solskajer’s side did not sign a replacement for Romelu Lukaku, who has got off to a flying start at Inter Milan. Marcus Rashford has been billed with the striker’s role but has netted just three times in the league and suffered a groin injury in last weekend’s dismal 2-0 loss at West Ham. Now rekindling interest in Mandzukic would represent a last throw of the dice to ease the attacking burden The Turin giants are looking for an £11million fee for Mandzukic and will not accept a loan bid. The 33-year-old believes he still has something to offer at the top level and has not yet featured under new Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri. He shunned the mega-money deal on offer in Qatar for a last chance at starring in a top league, concerned at the lack of first-class football facilities in the Middle East.
