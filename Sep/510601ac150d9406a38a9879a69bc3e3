Residents of Olasande Street in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State have expressed displeasure to Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKDC) over erratic power supply, “despite that we pay our bills regularly.” They rejected the firm’s addition of Superior Papers Printing Press at Okesanya Street to their transformer, which they said has been faulty for over one year. At a meeting with the representative of the company, the Chairman of Olasande Residents Association, Alhaji Yunus Arasi, said residents have been experiencing poor electricity supply for the past one year, adding that putting a printing press on their transformer will make life more unbearable for them. Arasi also lamented oil leakage and lack of maintenance for the transformer. He said: “We usually have irregular supply of power in our street and now they want to compound our problem by bringing another person from another transformer to connect to our transformer. We believe this will damage our transformer. “They are not just bringing someone but a printing press that will make the load too much on our transformer. Concerning the oil leakage, we have reported to EKDC for over a year, but nothing has been done. We are all customers and preference should not be given to one above another.” The Service Manager for EKDC in Mushin, who simply identifies himself as Engr. John, said the printing press had gone through the procedure to be on Olasandes’ transformer. He assured the residents that the printing press would not affect Olasandes’ power supply, saying EKDC would find a solution to their complaint.
