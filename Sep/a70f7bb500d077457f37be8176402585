ARSENAL legend Nwankwo Kanu has attacked his former club over its decision to sell Alex Iwobi to Everton for £30million on transfer deadline day. ”I would say they made a mistake 100 per cent,’ the Nigeria hero told Goal. ‘Why they let him go, I don’t know. He’s a boy who, in and out, is Arsenal. He always wanted to do his best for the club. He loves the club, but not only that, he can play football. ”What he brings week in, week out, the fans need to appreciate that. I think he is still young and those are the type of people you want in the team, people who grew up here, who knows everything about the club and prepared to die for the club. He was one of them, so for us to lose him and to let him go, was a shock. I couldn’t believe we did it, but that’s football.” Kanu also admitted he would have advised Iwobi to remain in north London had he been asked by his compatriot. ”It was a surprise to everybody because it happened right at the end of the window,” said Kanu. ”If I knew earlier, I could have said to him not to go and that it was better for him to stay. I would have said that there was no need for him to go because at Arsenal he will still play. He’s that good and he needs to know that. ”I think Arsenal would have been the best place for him because it’s a big club and you want to play in a big club and Europe. Those are the games you want to play.” The Nigeria international has since scored twice in three games for his new club having left his boyhood team after 149 appearances. And Kanu believes Iwobi will prove to be a huge loss. Once a Gunner, Always a Gunner. We are proud of you @alexanderiwobi and will continue to support you. Good luck with your new club.
