The judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal upholding the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari was expected, the President’s Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Social Investment Programmes, Ismaeel Ahmed, has said. Ahmed, a member of the APC Board of Trustees (BoT) and a Director in the 2019 Buhari Presidential Campaign Council, noted that a genuine electoral mandate was given to President Buhari and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo in the February 23 poll. He said it reflected the mood and political reality in the country. The Kano-born politician noted that from onset, it was obvious that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did not have any strong point to back its claims. “A genuine electoral mandate was given to us in February, which truly reflected the mood and political reality in the country. We didn’t win in any state that we didn’t have a strong wind going into the elections. “As a matter of fact, we lost in states that we could have won, if we were to do what PDP was used to doing during elections. We wouldn’t have lost Abuja, or Oyo or Imo or Edo, where we had APC governors and a Federal Government. “This was an extremely fair contest with results that reflected the mood of the country at the time and we won squarely, as the courts have affirmed today. No one in this country can contest President Buhari’s appeal and popular support. “Many Nigerians do not just love President Buhari because he is loveable, but they cherish the qualities and charisma he brings to the table. He is a man of determination. He has an unassailable public profile that speaks humility and integrity. He is focused and has Nigeria’s interests at heart.”
