Frank Aigbogun, Publisher and CEO, BusinessDay Media Ltd, organisers of the awards, stated that FoodCo’s commitment to excellence in enterprise as well as its commendable growth profile across successive generations of leadership were key factors that stood the company out. According to him, “The selection of FoodCo Nigeria Limited for this award is in consideration of the ability of successive leaderships of the company to steer it towards greater levels of success.
