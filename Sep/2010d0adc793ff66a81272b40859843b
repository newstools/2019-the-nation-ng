A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Department of State Services (DSS) to forthwith grant freedom to detained convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a ruling on Tuesday, directed that Sowore, who was also presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) in the last presidential election, be handed to his lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), who is to produce him for arraignment whenever he is required. Justice Taiwo noted that since a charge has already been filed against Sowore, he should deposit his passport and other travel documents to ensure his availability for trial. The ruling was on an application for bail, which Falana argued early on Tuesday. Details shortly.
