Despite not having the best of preparation and competing for honours with fewer numbers of athletes at the Rabat 2019 African Games in Morocco, Team Nigeria finished second behind Egypt, nearly equaling the number of medals won at the 2015 edition in Congo Brazzaville. OLALEKAN OKUSAN and AKEEM LAWAL, who covered the African version of the Olympics, x-ray the exploits of the 308-man team.  AT the 2015 edition of the African Games in Congo Brazzaville, Nigeria had 573 athletes competing in 21 sports and finished second with 47 gold, 55 silver and 42 bronze medals. But at this year’s edition in Morocco, with 308 athletes made up 153 men and 155, Team Nigeria featured in 22 sports to finish in second place, amassing 46 gold, 33 silver and 48 bronze medals. 13 of the 22 sporting events contributed the medals with weightlifting contributing the largest number of medals to Nigeria’s second spot finish.  Weightlifting produce bag of goodies Unlike what happened at the 2015 edition when athletics produced the bulk of the country’s medals, it was weightlifting that delivered a bag full of medals with 16 gold,13 silver and 18 bronze medals. Parading some of the youngest weightlifters in the competition, Nigeria finished four medals short of the 51 medals (16 gold, 24 silver and 11 bronze), won at Congo Brazzaville in 2015. Egypt continued their dominance in weightlifting for the second consecutive edition of the Games with 56 medals (31 gold, 20 silver and five bronze). The event held at the Salle Nahda Sports Hall in Rabat, saw fast-rising Emmanuel Appah carting home the three gold medals in the men’s 61kg category -Snatch (120kg), Clean-Jerk (151kg) and totalling 271kg to pick his third goal medal. Appah, who won three gold medals at the 2014 African Youth Games in Gaborone, Botswana and silver at the 5th Commonwealth Youth Games (CYG) held at Apia, Samoa in 2015, showed his quality as a star to look out for at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Joy Eze Ogbonne took a cue from Appah with three gold medals in the women’s 64kg – clean and jerk (121kg), Snatch (97kg) and polled a total of 218kg for her third goal medal. Also, Folashade Lawal claimed three gold medals in women’s 59kg competition (210kg), Clean-Jerk (117kg) and Snatch (93kg). Fatima Musa also contributed three gold medals in Women’s 81kg (219kg), Clean-Jerk (122kg) and Snatch (97kg), while Adijat Olarinoye won two gold in Women’s 55kg (209kg) Clean-Jerk (116kg) and silver in Snatch (93kg). There was no doubt that Nigeria weightlifters showed class in Rabat and this would surely put the country in a good position for medals in Tokyo. Athletics live up to expectation Nigeria maintained her stronghold and continued her dominance in the athletics event by emerging tops with 23 medals (10 gold, seven silver and six bronze). This is a better performance than the 2015 edition of the continental showpiece where Team Nigeria won the event with a total of 21 medals (8 gold, 9 silver and 4 bronze) The peak of Nigeria’s achievement in athletics in Rabat came in the men’s 100m, where Raymond Ekevwo emerged as the fastest man on the continent after winning the final in a record time of 9.96secs at the Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex. The Ughelli-born sprinter, who also qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, became the first Nigerian male athlete in 12 years to win the 100m at the African Games since Olusoji Fasuba achieved the feat with 10.18s in 2007 in Algiers. Ekevwo also teamed up with the trio of Divine Oduduru, Emmanuel Arowolo and Itsekiri Usheoritse in the men’s 4x100m final, but the quartet could only settle for silver after finishing behind Ghana. It was, however, 20-year-old triple jumper Grace Anigbata who won Team Nigeria’s first gold in the track and field events. She leapt to a distance of 13.75m ahead of 14 other contestants to write her name in gold. Long jumper, Ese Brume finally cemented her position as the queen of long jump in Africa by winning gold in Rabat. The 23-year-old Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medalist narrowly missed out of Games’ record of 6.70m as she leapt a distance of 6.69m to claim the top prize. In the discus, 25-year-old Chioma Onyekwere secured her position as the best on the continent by throwing a distance of 59.91m on her fifth attempt to win gold ahead of South Africa’s duo of Yolandi Stander (57.75m) and Iscke Senekal (53.95). The reigning champion has also won two continental titles for Nigeria within 12 months. Commonwealth Games Silver medalist Chukwuebuka Enekwechi also registered Nigeria’s name in the gold medal section by winning the men’s shot put event. The 26-year-old reigning champion broke Frank Elemba’s Africa Games record of 20.25m to set a new one of 21.48m, a mark he achieved on his last attempt. Also, Africa’s 110m hurdles champion Tobi Amusan ran a 12.68s retains her title in the women’s event. The 22-year-old surpassed Glory Alozie’s Africa Games record of 12.74s which was set two decades ago in Johannesburg, setting a new one of 12.68s (-0.6) to win the event’s gold medal. National Record holder in the women’s Javelin, Kelechi Nwanaga also defended her Javelin title, throwing a distance of 55.88m to be crowned the African Games champion for the second consecutive time. After a disappointing 5th place finish in the final of the women’s 400m, multiple national champion, Patience Okon-George had a consolation with a gold in the women’s 4x400m. Okon-George and the trio of Kemi Francis, Blessing Oladoye and Favour Ofili ran the race of their lives 3:30.32 to finish ahead of Botswana (3:31.96) and Uganda (3:32.25). It was also a good outing for United States-based Sade Olatoye who competed in the women’s shot put in Rabat and punched her ticket to the IAAF World Championships with a first-place finish. Her first-round attempt of 16.61m was good enough for the gold medal, while she also added a bronze in the hammer throw with a distance of 16.61m. Wrestling delivers as usual Prior to the games, there was optimism that wrestling would deliver and true to the expectation, wrestling mopped up several medals with the women the greater contributor to the feat. The Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) paraded 16 wrestlers competing in freestyle and Greco-Roman events. The sports amassed 12 medals made up of seven gold, four silver and one bronze medal. At the 2015 African Games in Congo Brazzaville, 23 wrestlers won 19 medals which included nine gold, five silver and five bronze medals – comparatively one of the highest medal-winning sport at the Games. But in the 2019 edition, Nigeria dominated the female event, as usual, winning five gold and a silver medal. The men contributed two gold and three silver medals in the freestyle and a bronze in the Greco-roman event. Nine-time Africa champion, Blessing Oborududu (68kg), World Championship silver medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye (57kg); two-time Commonwealth champion, Aminat Adeniyi (62kg), African champions Mercy Genesis (50kg) and Blessing Onyebuchi (76kg) delivered the gold for the country, while Bose Samuel (53kg) won the silver medal. In the men’s freestyle event, multiple African champions, Daniel Amas (65kg) and John Emmanuel Ogbonna (74kg) won gold, while Soso Taramau (97kg), Ebikwenimo Welson (57kg) and veteran Sinivie Boltic (125kg) settled for a silver medal. The only medal in Greco-roman was a bronze medal won by Tochukwu Okeke (87kg). Canoeing shines Despite being an unpopular sport in the country, the canoeing team made their presence felt at the Games. Nigeria finished second in the event with four gold medal behind South Africa, who amazed 10 medals made up of eight gold, one silver and one bronze medals. Ayomide Bello was the brain behind the feat as she was involved in all the four gold medals won in the canoeing event. Bello finished with the time of 50.517sec to win the gold medal in the Canoeing C1 200m women final. She also combined very well with Goodness Foloki to secure the second gold medal for Nigeria in the C2 200m women final with a time of 48.793secs. She also her won a third gold medal in the C1 500m before teaming up with Foloki again to secure another gold medal in the C2 500m women’s final. Mixed fortune for football It was a case of mixed fortune in football event as the female U-20 team was unbeaten in Raba  t to claim the gold medal defeating Cameroun 3-2 on penalties in the final. But it was not the same story for the men as they were beaten 2-0 by Burkina Faso, with the Nigerians settling for the silver medal. With this result, the Nigerian team is still awaiting its first goal medal since winning it in the 1973 edition in Lagos 46 years ago. Taekwondo made an impact Taekwondo claimed the first medal for Nigeria at the Games but the team made up of 16 athletes (eight men and eight female) managed to contribute six medals with Chinazum Nwosu claiming the only gold in the women’s 49kg, while the team also raked in five bronze medals. Missed chance for table tennis Despite beating its one gold medal tally at the 2015 edition, table tennis missed a rare chance in Rabat after Nigeria failed to beat Egypt to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games tickets in the team event (men and women). Olajide Omotayo set a new record in the men’s singles after beating compatriot – Aruna Quadri 4-2 to win the gold medal in his maiden outing at the games. Also, the duo of Edem Offiong and Cecilia Akpan reclaimed the women’s doubles title after defeating their compatriots – Olufunke Oshonaike and Fatimo Bello. Table tennis being of the exciting events at the games lived up to its billing, while tennis, Karate, boxing, basketball, badminton and gymnastics also gave Nigeria some medals at the games. However, the likes of Blessing Okagbare and Oduduru failed to live up to pre-tournament hype. Minister looks up to the future Impressed with Team Nigeria’s performance in Rabat, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare pledged that the country would break the jinx of not winning a gold medal since Sydney 2000. He commended the contingent for a job well done, while promising to work with relevant stakeholders to ensure Nigeria excels at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. “This is a team of champions, they have been professional and committed in spite of all odds, and they came out tops just behind Egypt on the medals table. The result in Morocco signposts what is going to happen at the Tokyo Olympics, We will go there and win not just one gold, but gold medals by the grace of God. This is a team that is very inspiring and we intend to keep them together,” Dare stated. Aware that the task of winning gold medals in Tokyo is a tough one, the Minister promised a better preparation ahead of the Olympic Games in Japan. “I won’t be the minister of football alone, but for all the sports in general, and I have seen some sports here that need total support. Hence, we will give them all the necessary support they need, but I can assure you football won’t suffer.’’
