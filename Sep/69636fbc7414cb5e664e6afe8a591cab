According to her, “the woman who had become a regular customer had this morning invited me to the Secretariat and pretended to be waiting for someone, having entered one or two offices under the pretence of making some arrangements. “She later took my baby and set from me and asked me to go and buy recharge cards and before I came back, she had fled with my baby,” she stated.
