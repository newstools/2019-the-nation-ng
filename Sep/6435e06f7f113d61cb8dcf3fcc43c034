A BUSINESS mogul Chief Olatunde Ayinla Abudu  has donated N10million to  Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta. Abudu, a  Fellow of the institution, made the donation when the management of the institution paid him a visit in his Abeokuta residence to canvass financial support for the institution. Rector of the Polytechnic, Dr Samson Adeola Odedina, who led the management team, thanked Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, for returning the institution to status quo ante in June. Odedina said the meeting was meant to reopen a relationship with all stakeholders to bring back the institution’s glory. Odedina told their host that their effort was aimed launching the institution back to prominence through the 2019/2020 admission with the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB). He said management has reached an understanding with its regulatory body, the National Board For Technical Education (NBTE), to return the institution to its portal. In view of the ongoing development, Odedina assured  a revalidation and accreditation of 44 programmes previously run by the polytechnic, including its first set of agricultural and land-related courses. According to him, the institution is also taking advantage of the new Polytechnic Act signed by the Federal Government which empowers polytechnics nationwide to partner with other relevant institutions to produce high-level manpower. In his response, Chief Abudu reiterated his belief in the institution’s ability to address capacity gaps and employment generation in Nigeria. The nonagenarian educationist praised the Odedina-led management for initiating moves to re-ignite the relationship with stakeholders towards improving the lots of the institution. In 2017, the 40 year-old institution was rechristened Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology by the immediate past administration, a move that created an identity crisis before the present administration directed that status quo should be maintained.
