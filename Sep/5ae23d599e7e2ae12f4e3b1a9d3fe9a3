The Yoruba Youth Coalition Group has rejected and denounced the process that led to the emergence of Prof. Banji Akintoye as the leader of the Yoruba. A communiqué made available to reporters on Tuesday in Akure by the Yoruba Youth National Leader, Mr Eric Oluwole and the coalition spokesperson, Mr Ojo Bright, said: “Following the current trend of events within the leadership of Yoruba race, we wish to state without mincing words that the youth of Yoruba extraction vehemently denounce the declaration of Prof. Banji Akintoye as the leader of the race. “While we note the essence and need for a Yoruba leader at a critical time like this, we, however, frown at a backyard and lopsided process to produce a leader for the race. “We consider this fire brigade approach as one capable of achieving the total opposite of the desired result for the unification of the Yoruba race. This desecration must stop now,” the communiqué read in parts.” The group urged the youth to rise up and graduate from being referred to as mere future leaders to leaders of today and tomorrow, saying “hence we cannot afford to mortgage our future by maintaining criminal silence on this pertinent issue.”
