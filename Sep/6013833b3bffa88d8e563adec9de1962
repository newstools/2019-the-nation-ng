Residents of Umuahia, the Abia State capital have raised their concerns over the growing rate of crime in the city center and its environs. They are calling on heads of various security agencies to think of a more pro-active and better way of checkmating the rising incidence of crime in the state capital. They feared that if nothing was urgently done to nip crime in the bud by security agencies, they might be forced to take laws into their hands. This is even as many maintained that though jungle justice is not lawful, it is a better way of serving justice and sending out a note of warning to people who might wish to make the state haven and unsafe for residents to carry out their illegal business. Investigation by our reporter has it that most of the robbery incidents included car theft, snatching of handsets, burglary and among other crimes were prevalent in the state capital. Some of the residents including Mr. Gilbert Onyema stated that the increasing crime in the capital city is worrying. Onyema who claimed that he has once fallen victim of a robbery incident said “the other day it was a supermarket. The number of car theft is second to none. We don’t even count the number of burglary. “Sometimes, we wonder if the police and other security agencies are working. I have been a victim of these hoodlums. I was robbed about 6:30pm. We learnt that the state governor gave them patrol vans and the question is whether they are patrolling with them or that they parked it in their barracks.” According to the sources who pleaded anonymity, they were working round the clock to ensure that crime is reduced drastically. This is even as they disclosed that several arrests have been made while areas including bunks suspected to be hideout for criminals were being raid on intervals. The sources said, some of the suspects have been arrested and charged to various courts while investigation is still ongoing in some of the cases that they are yet to wrap up.
