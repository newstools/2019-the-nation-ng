A polo tournament has been organised by the Kebbi State Government in partnership with Fayrouz towards the commemoration of the 85th edition of the Argungu Fishing Festival next year. At the tournament, Fayrouz sponsored one of the teams which won the Emir of Argungu Cup. The festival is a major celebration in the northwestern part of the country. Since the inaugural edition of the festival which marked the end of the wars between the Sokoto Caliphate and the Kebbi Kingdom in 1934, it has been a tourist attraction which has drawn over 30,000 fishermen. Speaking at the event, Brand Manager, Fayrouz, Freya Doessel, spoke of the brand’s commitment to being a huge part of its consumers’ lifestyle. “We have the utmost respect for our customers from this part of the country. Being a part of the build-up to the Argungu Festival is really special for us and we hope we’ve been able to add an extra bit of excitement to the already interesting line up of activities, making it refreshingly different,” She said. Dignitaries at the event were Minister of Justice, Justice Abubakar Malami; the Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu; the Sultan of Sokoto, Sultan Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar;  and the Emir of Gwandu and Chairman, Kebbi Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Muhammadu Bashar, among others.
