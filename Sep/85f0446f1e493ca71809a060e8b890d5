The Founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church aka Winners’ Chapel International, Bishop David Oyedepo, has urged Christians to offer a timely thanksgiving to God. Oyedepo, the guest speaker, who preached at the weekend in Oregun, Lagos at the 70th birthday celebration of a popular gospel musician, Pastor Joseph Adelakun {alias Ayewa}, said Christians should offer a timely, not a belated thanksgiving, to God Almighty. He said the purpose of a thanksgiving such as a birthday celebration was to get more blessings from God. The cleric said: “Thanksgiving is a powerful force. It should be done to secure blessings, perfect blessings and multiply blessings. “Christians should always thank God, no matter the situation. They should not murmur, they should not grumble. For sleeping at night and waking up in the morning, you owe God a thanksgiving. If you offer God a timely thanksgiving, it will spur him to pour more blessings on you.” He congratulated the celebrator for turning 70 and wished him more prosperous years on earth in good health. The chairman of the occasion, Dr. Erastus Akingbola, noted that Evangelist Adelakun usually smiled regardless of what he was going through. He described him as being humble and generous, saying he is a prayer warrior who wins souls for Jesus Christ through music. Pastor Adelakun thanked God for sparing his life to turn 70. He expressed gratitude to people for honouring him with their presence. Evangelist Adelakun launched a book titled: “Stepping stone to enjoying success”. He also launched an album titled: “New Glory”. Personalities at the event included clerics, gospel musician Tope Alabi, who sang to bring the celebrator and his wife, Clara, to the high table, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey and others.
