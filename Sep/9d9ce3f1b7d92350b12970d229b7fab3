Idowu Agbaje, the best boxer at the 105th edition of the Monthly Saturday Boxing Show held recently at Rowe Park in Lagos, has revealed that he wants to win the prestigious Lagos Governor’s Belt. Idowu told NationSport it would be an honour to join his brother Taiwo in winning the premier amateur boxing competition in Nigeria that discovered national champions like Olaide Fijabi and Joseph Oto. Taiwo Agbaje,a two-time Lagos Governor’s belt champion, is a fast-rising featherweight and was named the best boxer at the last GOtv Boxing Night. “It would be an achievement to win the Governor’s Belt as my role models Taiwo, Fijabi Olaide and Oto Joseph have done in the past and I believe taking the belt home will boost my boxing career. “I hope to join my elder brother in winning the belt. It would be an honour to be the first brothers to win it” The Governor’s Belt holds every Boxing Day, December 26 and is organised by the Lagos State Amateur Boxing Association in partnership with Lagos Boxing Hall of Fame, chaired by Olawale Edun.
