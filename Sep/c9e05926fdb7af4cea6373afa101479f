The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), BudgIT, Enough is Enough (EiE) and 6,721 concerned Nigerians have filed a suit to prevent the Senate from spending N5.5 billion on cars for every senator. The concerned Nigerians prayed the court to “restrain, prevent and stop the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) from paying or releasing N5.550 billion budgeted for purchase of luxury cars for principal members of the Ninth Senate, and to restrain and stop the Senate from collecting the money until the downward review of the amount proposed by the Senate”. In suit filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos, the plaintiffs argued that “spending …N5.550 billion to buy luxury cars for principal members of the Ninth Senate is unjust and unfair”. They added: “It negates the constitutional oath of office by members to perform their functions in the interest of the well-being and prosperity of Nigeria and its citizens, as contained in the Seventh Schedule of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution (as amended).” The plaintiffs also said: “The proposed spending by the Ninth Senate raises pertinent questions: What is the economic value and contribution of the vehicles sought to be purchased to the grand scheme of Nigeria’s economy? What are the parameters used to arrive at the cost efficiency and value for money in the decision to purchase the vehicles? Where are the vehicles purchased by the eighth Senate?” The concerned Nigerians, who joined the suit as co-plaintiffs with SERAP, BudgIT and EiE, include: BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) co-conveners Oby Ezekwesili and Aisha Yesufu as well as Jibrin Ibrahim, Edetaen Ojo, Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi and Deji Adeyanju.
