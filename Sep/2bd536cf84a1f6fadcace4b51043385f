Transport Correspondents Association of Nigeria (TCAN) has urged the Federal Government to construct more standard gauge railway lines across the country. Its chairperson, Augusta Uchediunor, said completion of the Lagos-Ibadan project would boost growth and reduce traffic congestion. The TCAN chief expressed the hope that the minister would accomplish the plan to extend the Warri to Itakpe standard gauge line to Abuja and Warri Port. The association commended the decision to establish a manufacturing factory for coaches at Kajola, Ifo area of Ogun State, and the establishment of  a University ofTransportation in Daura, Katsina State. The association lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for returning Rotimi Amaechi and appointing Ms Gbemisola Saraki as ministers of Transport. The association, in a statement in Lagos, expressed confidence in Amaechi’s capacity to drive the reform initiatives of the government in the transportation sector. It said the return of Amaechi and the appointment of Ms Saraki reflected the unflinching commitment of the administration to taking the transportation sector to the next level. Its chairperson added: “We believe Saraki will bring her experiences and competence to bear in supporting Amaechi, who has, from the outset when he joined the Buhari government in 2015, showed a great zeal and passion for the transportation sector.”
