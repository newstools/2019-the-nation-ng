National President, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Comrade Danielson Bamidele Akpan, has secured the release of two students arrested by the police, in connection with the crisis in the wake of a protest by students of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) last weekTuesday. The two students, Ogunlana Olabisi, 200-Level Electrical Electronics and Adeniji Oluwasegun, 300-Level  Agric Education, were to be arraigned in court on Monday before NANS’ intervention secured their unconditional release. Interestingly, too, students allegedly extorted by the police have identified the officers that demanded cash from them to facilitate their bail. Comrade Akpan also secured the release of the Students’ Union bus which was seized by the police and handed over to the FUOYE SU. The students’ body had earlier threatened to shut down the entire Ekiti State by what it described as ‘mother of all protests’ before eventually reaching a compromise with the police and Ekiti State government. On Tuesday last week, the students protested against poor electricity supply in Oye Township. They blocked the Oye and Ikole campuses, barring students and workers from gaining entrance into the school premises. CAMPUSLIFE gathered that the protesters blocked the wife of Ekiti State Governor Erelu Bisi Fayemi while returning from a tour of the 16 local government areas of the state, where she had furthered her empowerment programme. The otherwise peaceful protest erupted in crisis as the police attached to the First Lady attempted to smuggle her via the surging protesters, a scenario that eventually deteriorated, and leaving two students dead, vehicles vandalised,  and several others injured.
