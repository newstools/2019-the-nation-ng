The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Saturday said they were no longer interested in any apology from the South-East governors. The pro-biafran group had in an open letter to the South-East governors, made many demands from the governors for there to be a truce which included open apology. The governors, on their parts, through their forum chairman, and Ebonyi state governor, David Umahi had said governors in the zone have no apology to tender to the group. They said IPOB has no right to place a travel ban on South-East governors and other top politicians from the zone. But in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, the separatist movement described the governors as weak and pathetic men who have sworn lotalty to their Fulani masters. The statement partly read, “Following the recent denial and subsequent refusal of South East Governors to apologize or do the needful towards IPOB against a background of their incessant attacks, abduction, arrest, killings and proscription of unarmed peaceful Biafrans; before, during and after Operation Python Dance II in 2017, we the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) categorically state that we are not interested in any apology coming from those who have continued to shamelessly preside over the Fulanisation of their ancestral lands. “Unfortunately most people are yet to understand the danger these people portend for our existence as a race. “We remain conscious of the complicity and duplicity of South East Governors in the whole Operation Pyyhon Dance debacle and will hold them accountable at the right time. “We are aware of their secret dealings with the Government of Nigeria to enslave our people, a task we assure them can never be accomplished as long as IPOB exists.
“We are waiting for them to set foot abroad or appear in public anywhere outside Nigeria then they will know how upset we are.”
