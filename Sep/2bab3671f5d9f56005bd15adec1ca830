Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has hailed Tacha one of the housemates in the ongoing Big Brother Naija season 4. Wike via Twitter wished her the best as she competes for the grand prize of N60 million. Tacha, during a task presentation, said governor Wike impacted her life positively. Reacting to this, the governor said: “ I appreciate the mention and wish Tacha all the best #bbnaija.” This week’s Wager Task Challenge theme was to show love to the elderly ones by developing five presentations which included painting, sculpture, knitting, a poem and a unique special piece. Team Enigma, however, won the task. After the latest eviction, twelve housemates are now competing for the N60million prize.
