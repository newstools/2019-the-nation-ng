A middle-aged man, Mr. Okon Samson Udofia, has appealed to the Akwa Ibom State Government and individuals to help him. He alleged that his son has burnt down his house. Udofia, an oil palm tree tapper and an indigene of Ikot Nya village in Nsit Ibom Local Government, said he is homeless and in need of a roof over his head. Narrating his ordeal to The Nation, Udofia said his 20-year-old son, who is suspected to be mentally-deranged, torched his house at about 9pm on Wednesday when he was asleep. He said his son was a threat to him and the community, adding that he had appealed to the police to save the situation, but to no avail. ‘’My son, Iniobong, is mentally unwell and I have been crying and asking the police to apprehend him and take him to a psychiatric hospital, but they (police) keep telling me it is not their responsibility to arrest mentally-deranged people. ‘’My son has been very violent to the extent of threatening to kill me and other villagers. Last night he set ablaze my house while I was sleeping at about 9pm. ‘’The fire burnt the house and my belongings worth over N500,000. It is by the grace of God that I managed to escape. This is not the first time he has committed this kind of atrocity,” Udofia said. He said his predicament was a warning to other Ikot Nya residents, as his son, if not arrested and taken to a psychiatric hospital, might kill somebody very soon. ‘’I am taking this opportunity to call on the police and the government to arrest Iniobong and take him to a psychiatric hospital, otherwise he will wreak more havoc.” One of the villagers, Udeme Uyoatta, told our correspondent that the community was no longer safe, as Iniobong was on the rampage. He said the community had appealed to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) to arrest Iniobong, but he kept saying it was not the responsibility of the police to arrest mentally-deranged people. Attempts through calls and SMS to reach the DPO proved abortive at press time.
