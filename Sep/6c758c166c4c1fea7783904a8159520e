 The Darius Ishaku-led electoral committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) distorted the alphabetical order of voting to allow former President Goodluck Jonathan the privilege of voting first in the primaries. Jonathan was asked to lead delegates from Ogbia, his Local Government Area, to cast their votes first instead of Brass local government area, which should have come first by alphabetical order.
