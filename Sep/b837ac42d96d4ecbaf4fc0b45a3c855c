The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, on Thursday said that the party will win the November election. He urged the chieftains to gird their loins ahead of the exercise, saying victory is assured if they work in unity. He thanked the delegates who elected him at the primary, assuring that he will not disappoint them and the people of the state. Diri said in a statement by his campaign organisation that the party will soon embark on campaigns in the eight local governments. He said: “We are humbled and elated by the massive show of solidarity and the sacrifices made by the delegates to ensure that the distinguished Senator emerges victorious in what has gone down as the most competitive governorship primary in the state. “Our heartfelt gratitude also goes to our amiable leader, His Excellency the Honourable Henry Seriake Dickson, Governor of Bayelsa State for his display of uncommon political leadership and sagacity. Diri added: “Let us also commend the national leadership of our party and the Governor Darius Ishaku led committee for a job well done, especially for allowing a level playing field. “We also appreciate PDP leaders and stakeholders, women, youths and Bayelsans for their support, prayers and wise counsel since we began this journey to move our state to greater heights. We acknowledge the efforts of other aspirants who gave their best shot for the ticket. Our victory is a collective one so we enjoin them as true party men to stand with us as we move closer to make this project a reality. “In the days ahead, we shall storm communities across the eight local government areas to present to our people what we are bringing to the table in the next four years. “It is going to be an interesting voyage as we intend to use the opportunity to discuss facts on competence, prosperity of our people and stable governance as a whole.”
