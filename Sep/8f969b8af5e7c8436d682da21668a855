IT is no longer business as usual for motorists in Oyo State. Henceforth, any traffic offender caught by the men of the state Road Traffic Management Agency (OYRTMA)Â  will face the wrath of the law immediately. This is because a special court set up to try traffic offenders will start sitting as early as Wednesday, September 18, 2019. The Executive Chairman of OYRTMA, Dr. Akin Fagbemi revealed this after meeting with Chief Magistrate of State Mobile Court, Magistrate Moruff Mudashiru visited him at his Ibadan office on Monday. Fagbemi charged the court to ensure fair and speedy trial of offenders to minimise what he called the culture of indiscipline by some road users in the state. The OYRTMA Chairman said motorists whose vehicles were impounded by the officers of the agency would face the mobile court and get speedy trial.
