The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has unveiled  the Maintenance Repairs Organisation (MRO) SmartHub, an online portal that brings transparency to the market for aircraft components and parts. The total MRO market is estimated to be $81.9 billion yearly,  a significant portion of which is attributed to material costs. Nigerian carriers will benefit from this window as it will enable airlines and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers to  list items to buy or sell on the new platform. Experts said the window would reduce over-payments by making the assessment of fair market value (FMV) more accurate. IATA MRO SmartHub, experts added, is  expected to save 10-15 per cent  of these material costs through efficiency gains in the supply chain and more accurate assessments of FMV. Also, the IATA MRO SmartHub will enable the accurate valuation of parts inventories.
