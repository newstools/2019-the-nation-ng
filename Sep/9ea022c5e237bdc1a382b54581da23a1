People who say that politicians without political offices are like fish out of water surely know what they are talking about if the case of an immediate past governor of one of the northern states is anything to go by. Since he lost his bid for a second term in the 2019 general elections, he has been angling for juicy positions in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. One of the positions he is eyeing desperately, SENTRY gathered, is that of the Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) currently occupied by a former Chief Executive Officer of the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service, Dr. Babatunde Fowler. Although many expect that the former governor would take his scanty academic qualifications into consideration in angling for the juicy office, he is driven by his belief that he could get anything he wants by pulling the right strings. He is busy pulling the strings in Abuja at the moment and even telling whoever cares to listen that he would succeed Fowler. Some of his close pals were said to have drawn his attention to his limited academic qualifications but he reportedly told them it is a political battle and not an academic one, hence he would fight it to the last point. Ironically, the former governor was said to have failed woefully to grow the internally generated revenue of his state while he held sway as the stateâ€™s chief executive.
