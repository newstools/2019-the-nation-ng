The burial of the late former President, of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe slated for Sunday, has been postponed indefinitely, Zimlive reports. Family members of the deceased ex-president confirmed the development. According to Mugabe’s nephew, Leo Mugabe, Mugabe was a chief and he would be given a traditional burial. He said, “Mugabe was a chief and he will be buried in accordance with tradition. The chiefs have not told us where he will be buried, so it is not clear yet. I also don’t know” . Mugabe died on Friday at the age of 95 in Singapore, where he was receiving medical treatment.
