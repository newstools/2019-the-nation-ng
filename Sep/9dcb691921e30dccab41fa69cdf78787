With less than 17 days to the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, the world athletics ruling body has tipped Nigeria’s Ese Brume as one of the possible medalists at the global event. Brume who jumped 6.69m in the women’s long jump at the 2019 African Games in Morocco to claim gold medal has been described by IAAF as the only African female athlete to reach the podium in field events between the 2017 IAAF World Athletics Championships and the 2016 Olympics Games. In its 13th edition of the stars to watch out for in Doha published on July this year, IAAF featured the African Champion whom they said has the quality to mount the podium in Doha. At 20 years of age, Brume reached the long jump final at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and finished fifth in the competition where she was the youngest contestant. In terms of numbers, her most successful year though was 2018 when she leapt 6.83m to win the African title on home soil in Asaba. She is aiming bigger though for this year’s Worlds in Doha,” IAAF stated. A confident Brume however told IAAF.org, “I will build on the successes I recorded on the track in 2018, especially as we look forward to the World Athletics Championship in Doha in 2019. By the Grace of God, I will capture a medal for Team Nigeria. That is my target,” Brume said. “The 2019 World Athletics Championship is a bigger event. I will need the support of Nigerians both the government, sports-loving individuals and corporate bodies to get a better result,” the Nigerian long jumper said, adding: “I will need the support of all Nigerians to achieve my dream, she added.
