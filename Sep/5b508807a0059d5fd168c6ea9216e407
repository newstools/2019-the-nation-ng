AFTER first acknowledging that the death of 36 cows at a site considered sacred by the people of Ijare, in Ondo State was an act of God, Miyetti Allah, the association of cattle breeders, have asked for compensation. Said their national president, Abdullahi Bodejo: “Our cows are supposed to be treated as other assets like cars that are insured. A Fulani man doesn’t have any company, but the cows are his company and industry; they are his everything – car, shops, etc. Now that the cows are dead, what do you want that Fulani man to do since they were not insured? So, the government, whether the state government or the federal government should pay compensation for those cows killed by thunderstorm. Even if a motorcar kills a cow on the road, the government should pay compensation, it is the best thing to do. Even if Fulani man wakes up to see his cow is dead, let the government pay compensation. If you don’t compensate him, maybe some bad company or bad people can invite him and teach him illegal things and he would join them to begin to torment other people. Government should pay him; death of 36 cows is not a small loss. It shouldn’t be a heavy thing for government to do; let the government quickly settle the Fulani man.” If he agrees that the cows were not insured, in the same way farmers probably do not insure their crops, where on earth does he expect the compensation to come from? From taxpayers, or from the gods to whom the deaths have been attributed? Who compensates poultry farmers whose businesses have been wiped off by disease? Mr Bodejo’s reasoning is unhelpful, and it is obviously at the bottom of the illogical self-importance herdsmen have all along attached to themselves and their business. Cattle breeding is a business like any other. Cattle owners’ gains and losses cannot be arbitrarily transferred.
