As part of their Community Development Service, the Road Safety Corps of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Lokoja chapter, is offering complementary services to the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), via traffic control. Its President, Nasiru Jamiu Oladapo, stated this during an exercise at major junctions in Lokoja. The excercise was in conjunction with the FRSC, Nigeria Police Force (NPF), and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The routes include: Ganaja junction; Government House junction, GTbank junction; State Specialist Hospital junction; Post Office junction, and Natako junction. Oladapo said: “We are embarking on these movement so as to enlighten and sentisise people of Lokoja on how to abide by the rule and regulations that governed roads and to always ensure their own personal safety on and off the road.” Oladapo, a Cadet in Chief, noted that since their obligation borders on ensuring effective control of  traffic, road safety, learning important road signs, as well as learning how to deal with road drivers, there was the need to take the bull by the horns. “Our outdoor meetings will also serve as a motivation for most undergraduate to be eager to serve and belong to FRSC CDS and as well avenues for all our members of FRSC CDS to acquire road and traffic controlling system;be motivated to tackle any related road issues that they might be encountering in the nearest future. “We are still planning to strengthen our wings around the schools in introducing FRSC club to them. Likewise, we are planning to go on courtesy visit to FMC (Federal Medical Centres) and some hospital to check on road accident victims and embark on road sensitisation – be  they car drivers, motorist and even pedestrians.”
