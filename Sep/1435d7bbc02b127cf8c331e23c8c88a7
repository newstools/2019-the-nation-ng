President Muhammadu Buhari has sent warm felicitations to Segun Awolowo, Executive Director of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), on his 56th birthday. He congratulated him for consistently serving the nation for many years, including working with four presidents. The President, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, joined family members, friends and professional colleagues of the lawyer and scion of Chief Obafemi Awolowoâ€™s family in celebrating another milestone. The President noted that the Executive Director has demonstrated the same keen interest in humanity, and patriotism in affairs of the nation that separated his grandfather for commendation. President Buhari affirmed that the Zero Oil target introduced by the NEPC, with the goal of diversifying the economy by increasing the chains of valued-added exports, had impacted greatly on the economy, prompting Nigerians to also consider the global market in productions and marketing strategy. As Mr Awolowo turns 56, the President urged more commitment and dedication to public service, assuring him that posterity will remember his sacrifices and loyalty to the nation. President Buhari prayed for strength and wisdom for the Executive Director of NEPC.
