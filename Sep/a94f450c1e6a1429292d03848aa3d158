One hundred exhibitors from Nigeria and other countries are expected to converge on the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos for the West Africa Automotive Show (WAAS) in November. Besides displaying the latest developments and products in the spare parts and services sector, suppliers, dealers and manufacturers will be available to discuss best practice for the industry. Nigerian businesses, according to the organisers, BtoB Events, will account for about 30 per cent of exhibitors. There will be pavilions for Morocco and China, smaller groupings from Thailand, Egypt, Tunisia and India, and other countries. BtoB Events’ Managing Director Jamie Hill said: “We have a wealth of international exhibitors looking to bring high-tech equipment to Nigeria for the first time and a large number of local exhibitors are looking to expand their business and increase exports to surrounding countries,” he said. Lagos, Hill said, was picked to launch the show because it has capacity to become the automotive hub of the African continent with over 11.5 million vehicles on the roads. “With over 60 per cent of vehicles on the road being over 12 years old, there is a huge aftermarket industry. The need for high quality and affordable spare parts is becoming increasingly important,” he said, adding: “There is also a real hunger to boost the local assembly of vehicles across the country with the 2013 National Automotive Industry Development plan (NAIDP). With more assembly plants being set up, this, again, significantly increases the demand for spare parts. We are committed to supporting Nigeria to reach its forecast of having 70 per cent of new cars sold being assembled or manufactured domestically by 2050.”
