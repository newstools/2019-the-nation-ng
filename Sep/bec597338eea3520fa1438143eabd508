The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, Mr Donatus Nwankpa, has hailed Wednesday’s victory of President Muhammadu Buhari against his challenger, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which sat in Abuja. Nwankpa, who spoke with our reporter on Thursday, described the ruling of the tribunal as a landmark. The APC chieftain noted that the judgment was the most painstaking ruling ever given by Nigerian judges. Contrary to insinuations that the PDP’s presidential candidate has chances of getting favourable judgment at the Supreme Court, Nwankpa insisted that Atiku only has the right to appeal the judgment. The APC chieftain said the PDP candidate would not succeed because the tribunal judges took their time to do a thorough job. “When we talk about change, it has to be fundamental. What happened on Wednesday was a proof of that change,” he said. Nwankpa urged the President to relax and focus on taking the country to the Next Level. “You cannot stop an ambitious man from going to appeal. Atiku will commit no crime if he goes to Appeal Court. But I will also want him to take cognisance of the people’s feelings and the realities of the facts of the ruling.”
