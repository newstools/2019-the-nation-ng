Ondo State has again reiterated its commitment to harness her abundant human and natural resources with a view to transforming the state to one of the most developed states in the country through strategic implementation of projects and programmes. The state commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Pastor Emmanuel Igbasan, stated this during the second edition of the ministry’s consultative meeting with Persons with Disabilities (PWD), coalition of Civil Societies Organisations  (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) in the state on the preparation of the 2020-2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework  (MTEF) and 2020 budget held at the Babafunke Ajasin Auditorium, Igbatoro Road Akure, the state capital. Igbasan explained that it was in continuation of the lofty idea of inclusive governance of the Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led administration in the state, which necessitated strategic consultative engagement process with relevant organisations for the preparation of the state budgets. The meeting with this group signifies the beginning of series of further discussions with various groups on the 2020-2022 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and year 2020 budget of the state. According to him, Ondo State budget now assumes bottom up approach where government executes what the people really need and not what government thinks they need.
