Africa’s preferred smartphone brand Tecno, has offered scholarships to university students in Nigeria. The technology firm extended the gesture to the students during the ACADAFEST, a concert put together by ScholarX and iManage, organisations, celebrities and members of the public to sponsor 20 deserving students through university. Tecno Nigeria, PR and Strategic Partnership Manager Jesse Oguntimehin, who spoke on the gesture, said  Tecno is sponsoring three of the 20 students for the duration of their university education to the tune of N400,000 each per student. “At Tecno, we have carried out various social activities such as our Give the Nigerian Child A Future initiative- where we visited selected schools around the country to empower bright students, awarding them scholarships for their academic excellence. We also provided pupils within these schools educational materials to ease their learning journey. There was also the annual Light Up Your Dream competition where we rewarded two young Nigerian Entrepreneurs with N1million each to grow their businesses,” he said. He said this year, in line with its determination to impact positively on its consumers, Tecno  decided to collaborate with the oraganisers for the maiden edition of the ACADAFEST where it awarded three Nigerian students scholarships reiterating the commitment to the development of the Nigerian society.
