The Federal Government has been urged to direct the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to reconstruct failed sections of the Warri-Sapele-Benin Expressway in Delta State. The lawmaker representing Sapele, Okpe and Uvwie Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Hon. Efe Afe, made the call on Sunday while he was stuck in the traffic jam caused by the deplorable state of the Adeje community section of the highway. He emphasised that hoodlums have seized the opportunity to attack unsuspecting road users at the bad spots. The lawmaker particularly stated that the road should not be patched, but reconstructed urgently. He explained that the road needed a total overhaul because of the heavy-duty trucks which ply it on daily basis, adding that Delta, an oil-bearing state which connects the Southsouth states to other regions of Nigeria, does not deserve such dilapidated road. He said: “Patching the failed portion of the Warri-Sapele-Benin Expressway would not help matters as diesel, petrol and other petroleum products-laden heavy trucks regularly pass through the busy road.” He further revealed that the poor state of the road has crippled economic activities of his constituents. “People travelling from Lagos to Warri and its environs spend more time on the road; motorists spend more money to buy fuel due to the deplorable conditions of the road. The Federal Government needs to intervene to alleviate the sufferings of motorists and commuters,” Afe said. He, however, expressed gratitude to the Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for his administration’s efforts to rehabilitate the expressway in the past.
