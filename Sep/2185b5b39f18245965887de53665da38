Renewable energy has been described as the panacea and future of power generation in order to overcome the problem of insufficient power supply. Member of Lagos State House of Assembly, representing Kosofe constituency 1, Hon. Ganiu Okanlawon Sanni stated this in his speech at the commencement of a training and empowerment programme he co-sponsored with Fun-nergy Technologies Company for his constituents. According to him, renewable energy solutions which are naturally replenished on human timescale such as sunlight, wind, tidal waves and geothermal heat is cheap clean energy devoid of emission of carbon dioxide and pollution. Addressing journalists, Okanlawon said it was a shared vision between him and the Managing Director of Fu-nergy, Mr. Nojeem Absulrasaq. “We decided that we should use the programme to better the lots of the people of my constituency.  With this programme, 250 of our teeming unemployed youths would be taken out of the labour market after the completion of the planned 4th phase, though the programme is starting with 30 trainees today.” He said although his duty as a lawmaker is to make laws, he however wants to put smiles on the faces of the people of his constituency. “The programme is practically meant to empower our people. For those who would be trained for the next three months, those who are outstanding among them would be gainfully employed and paid salaries,” he said.
