HEAD coach of the Super Eagles Team B, Imama Amapakabo has expressed confidence that good  outing  at  the West Africa Football Union (WAFU ) tournament in Senegal will  change the loss image of the team among Nigerians having been humiliated 4 – 1 in the last CHAN encounter with Sparrow Hawks of Togo. Apakamabo who made this known at the point of departure to Senegal for the competition , said meeting Togo again in the WAFU tournament is the best time to avenge the defeat suffered in Lome. “You know that match in Togo was a big blow to me having taking the lead with few minutes of play. The Hawks are good and physical but my boys will surprise them in this  tournament having corrected our mistakes and knowing their style of play. Beating us twice within a space of two weeks will be a double image dent which Nigerians will not accept. We must avoid failure”. Amapakabo concluded. Former Enugu Rangers tactician revealed that winning the WAFU tournament will restore absolute confidence on the team ahead of return leg, second round of Africa Championship qualifier bill for Asaba,Delta on October 19th. He also thanked his employer(NFF) for providing the team and technical crew with the needed logistics for this tournament.
