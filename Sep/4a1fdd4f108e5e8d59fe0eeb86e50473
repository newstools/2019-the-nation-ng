The Chairman, House Committee on Diaspora, Hon. Tolulope Akande-Sadipe has condemned the killing of Nigerians in South Africa describing it as ‘humiliating and traumatizing’. In a statement released, Akande-Sadipe called on the South African authorities at all levels to find lasting solution to the incessant killing of Nigerians. She said, “Xenophobia must be put to an end because it is an excuse for mass premeditated murder. This must stop, not by violent retaliation but by reorientation. “This is a misplaced aggression, a result of post-apartheid economic disparity, which should be addressed through social economic policies rather than the blame game against non-nationals” “I urge the South African government to ensure that lives and properties of all are protected without any bias against foreigners and to avoid being complicit in the attacks. Africa needs to unite for the collective progress of the continent”. She further added. While sympathizing with Nigerians living in South Africa, she promised that the house will collaborate with other relevant arms of government to ensure that a speedy diplomatic solution is achieved.
