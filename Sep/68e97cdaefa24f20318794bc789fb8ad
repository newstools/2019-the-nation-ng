THE Rural Electrification Agency (REA) will on Tuesday launch a  98.8KW solar hybrid mini-grid power plant at Kare-Dadin Kowa, in Kebbi State. Kare-Dadin Kowa is a small riverside community in Argungun Local Government Area of Kebbi State, with a population of about 3,180, whose major vocations are agriculture and fishing. The move is part of government’s commitment to provide access to electricity. The mini-grid system will provide energy to 483 residential buildings, 82 commercial buildings and will serve over 3,000 inhabitants of Kare-Dadin Kowa. A total of 565 high grid solar panels have been installed to power homes, businesses, places of worship, schools and health centres among others. REA is the implementing agency of the Federal Government tasked with electrification of unserved and underserved communities. Rural Electrification Fund (REF) Executive Director Dr. Sanusi Ohiare said, “Kare-Dadin Kowa community is the second of twelve communities earmarked to benefit from REF grants. This is due to following and attaining legal, regulatory and procurement compliance and no objection from the Federal Government.” Ohiare said the REF provides access to electricity to maximise the economic, social and environmental benefits of rural electrification grants, to promote off-grid electrification, and to stimulate innovative approaches to rural electrification. REF projects are administered using a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. The first call of the REF will energise 12 communities and deploy 19,000 Solar Home Systems (SHS).
