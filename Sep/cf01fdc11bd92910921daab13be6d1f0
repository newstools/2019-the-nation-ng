The European Union (EU) has supported Nigeria with 150 million euro to tackle the challenges of climate change in the country. The EU ambassador to Nigeria and Head of delegation, Mr. Ketil Karlsen, disclosed this at the European Union Climate Sustainability Event with the theme: “Renewable energy for a sustainable future”, held on Wednesday at the Dangote Business School, Bayero University, Kano. He said the union would also give Nigeria additional eight million euro for technical support for effective implementation of renewable energy projects so that the country could be in tune with the issue globally. “We are supporting Nigeria with €150 million for the renewable energy programme. Another €8 additional millions specifically targeting technical assistance on non-climate change issues. It is a huge priority for us and one of our biggest priorities.” Karlsen said there was an urgent need for the Federal Government to rise up to the challenges of climate, which could affect agriculture and the environment as well as human beings. “I want to urge the Federal Government to take the issue of climate change seriously so as to find a way forward and the biggest players should rise to the occasion by coming on board where everybody should play their roles and responsibilities.” Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje said the government would partner and continue to support EU to ensure success in the renewable energy project. Ganduje, represented by the Head of Service, Dr. Kabiru Shehu, noted that electricity was in bad shape in the country and stressed the need to take urgent steps and action that would ensure that Nigerians benefit from the renewable energy project.
