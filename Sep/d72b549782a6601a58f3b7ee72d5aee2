The Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has disclaimed a group that stormed the State secretariat of the party in Akure, on Thursday, canvassing support for the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, ahead of 2023. The group had stormed the state secretariat, with banners in a campaign tagged: ‘OSINBAJO 2023.’ It was led by one Bamise Akintomide. The party viewed the effort as “an avoidable distraction.” A statement by the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Comrade Alex Kalejaye, said, “The party wishes to firmly declare that it has no link whatsoever with the said group.” He contended that “the unusual campaign” was an embarrassment to the leaders of the party in the State. For the records, the group that could best be described as a non- governmental body, and looked a bit unorganised, only stormed the State secretariat of the party unannounced with their banners and other write-ups. “The party notes with deep concerns that a politically sophisticated state like Ondo knows better than engaging in premature campaigns for any election,” the statement read in part.
