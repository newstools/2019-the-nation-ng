Former President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is dead. He died in Singapore aged 95, as confirmed on twitter by current President Emmerson Mnangagwa According to Mnangagwa: “It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe’s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe. “Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.” Mugabe had led Zimbabwe in 1980 and again in 2017, before ultimately being booted after a military coup. His early years in power was praised for broadening access to health and education for the black majority – but his later years were marked by rights abuses and corruption. ZimLive first reported the death of the dictator who led the country during the two spells.
