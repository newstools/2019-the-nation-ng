A 39-year-old businessman, Olanrenwaju Coker, charged with obtaining N1 million on the pretext of bringing a car from overseas for a woman, at the weekend appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The defendant, living at Ipaja, Lagos, was arraigned before Magistrate Y. O. Aje-Afunwa on a three-count charge of breach of the peace, obtaining money under false pretences and stealing. Coker, however, denied committing the offences. Aje-Afunwa admitted the defendant to N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The magistrate said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Peter Nwagwu told the court that the defendant committed the offences on March 10 at Ipaja, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant fraudulently obtained the money from Mrs. Nneka Okoli on the pretext of bringing a Toyota Camry car for her. “After collecting the money from the complainant, he refused to bring the car for her. “Efforts by the complainant to get her car or money proved unsuccessful, as the defendant threatened to deal with her if she called him again,” the prosecutor said. Nwagwu said the complainant reported the case to the police, leading to the defendant’s arrest. The alleged offences contravene sections 166, 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Aje-Afunwa adjourned the case till November 4.
