The Lagos State Government is set to unlock 60 identified major highway junctions and corridors critically affecting the free flow of traffic within the Lagos metropolis. The State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, who made the disclosure during his project assessment visit to Oyingbo Bus Terminal corridor, stated that the traffic challenges which vary from junctions to corridors were even more compounded by the unregulated roadside trading, indiscipline of motorists and illegal parking. Revealing the locations of the 60 traffic gridlock areas identified across the State, the Commissioner said various strategies will be adopted to clear the logjam, hence the validation exercise preceding the junctions’ improvement works, planning and resolutions. He explained further that the gridlock areas will be unlocked in batches of five, starting with Iyana-Ipaja, Yaba/Oyingbo, Ketu, Ikorodu Roundabout and Ajah Junction, adding that the exercise has commenced in earnest with on-the-spot assessment of these areas. Oladeinde also hinted that the facilities needed for the water, rail and road multimodal transport plan of the State Government are already on ground at Oyingbo for the implementation of the present administration’s seamless transportation policy along the corridor. While decrying trading activities on major roads, Oladeinde reiterated the State Government’s commitment to bringing sanity to the market environment across the State and solicited for the cooperation of the market leaders and traders in the area, urging them to desist from roadside trading in order to avoid sanctions.
