Nigeria Automobile Technicians Association (NATA) Ejigbo Branch has appointed the Chairman of Ejigbo Local Council Development Area of Lagos State, Monsurudeen Bello as the Life Grand Patron. The appointment, NATA said, is in recognition of Bello’s selfless service to the people of Ejigbo, and his contributions towards the progress of the association. Bello, popularly called OBE, was honoured during the inauguration of the executive of the association. A plaque was presented to him by NATA’s state Deputy Chairman Olusegun Aikhomo Mayegun. Mayegun said the honour was also an appreciation of the council boss for bringing an end to the misunderstanding between members of the association. OBE, who was represented by the Vice Chairman, who doubles as Supervisor for Health, Dr Olatunde Olusunmade, thanked the association for honouring him. Olusunmade said the administration’s giant strides can be felt in areas of infrastructural development. “At the moment, Kashimawo Alimi Street beside NNPC bus stop is being rehabilitated. The project would be completed before the end of the year. This would reduce traffic gridlock at Jakande Gate. Dauda Ilo Road in Ejigbo and Junction Road in Oke-Afa are also under rehabilitation, while Adebayo Oyelana has been rehabilitated and in good condition,” he said. Olusunmade urged NATA members and residents of the council to support OBE for another term.
