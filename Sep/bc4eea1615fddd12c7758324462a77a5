The National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Tuesday upheld the election of the Chairman of Senate Committee on Land Transport, Abdulfatai Buhari. The senator is representing Oyo North. Buhari, a second-term senator, won the election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 23 poll. The unanimous judgment of the panel was read by Justice Sambo Daka. Other members of the panel are: Justice Anthony Akpovi (Chairman) and Justice Chinyere Ani. The panel said the petitioners, Mulikat Adeola-Akande and her party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), failed to prove their petition beyond reasonable doubt. It awarded a cost of N150,000 against the petitioners and refused to grant their request for damages. Buhari, who served as chairman Senate Committee of ICT and Cybercrimes in the Eighth National Assembly, won the election with over 18,338 votes to defeat Adeola-Akande, as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
