The Adamawa State Government has condemned a media report to the effect that Vice President Yemi Osibanjo would be launching Ruga initiative when he pays a working visit to the state on Tuesday, September 10. Some news outlets (excluding The Nation) had reported on September 7 and 8 that Osinbajo had been scheduled to launch Ruga in Adamawa despite the suspension of the initiative by the federal government. The Deputy Governor of the state, Chief Crowther Seth, who addressed newsmen on the report on Monday in Yola, said the state has nothing to do with Ruga but is implementing the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). “Nobody is reinventing Ruga. The National Livestock Transformation (which the state is implementing) was born a very long time before the so-called Ruga controversy surfaced,” Crowther Seth said. The deputy governor under whose office the state livestock transformation implementation is based, reminded the general public that this same vice president alleged to be scheduled for Ruga flag-off in Adamawa State “had on 3rd July 2019 stated very categorically to the whole world that the NLTP absolutely has nothing to do with the Ruga settlement initiative being paraded in certain quarters.” The Adamawa State Livestock Transformation Office, which will implement the NLTP in the state, is located in the Deputy Governor’s Office, Government House, Yola, and has Prof Alikidon Voh as chairman.
