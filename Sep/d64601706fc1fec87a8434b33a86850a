The All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate in Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon, has asked Governor Seriake Dickson to leave the APC alone and focus on dealing the post-primary election crisis rocking his party. Lyon in a statement on Wednesday by his Media Adviser, Chief Gift Ebiki, wondered why Dickson was crying more than the bereaved on issues that had nothing to do with him. The APC candidate said Dickson was dissipating his energy and wasting his time following the governor’s claims in a live media chat that the APC lacked a validly-elected and qualified candidate for the November 16 governorship poll in the state. “As a sitting governor, Dickson should concentrate more on governance rather than turning himself to a mischief-maker and a busybody”, he said. He added: “The statement credited to Dickson is unbecoming of a governor and the highest mischief and derogatory of a sitting governor. “The APC indeed has a validly-elected candidate and he is Chief David Lyon. Governor Dickson is not in a position to discuss APC matters, he should concern himself with the crisis which is tearing his Party PDP. “It is only INEC that can talk of parties’ candidates being validly nominated or not and indeed Chief David Lyon is the Candidate of the APC. “This clearly shows that Governor Dickson hand is behind some failed APC aspirants’ desire to cause confussion in APC but they have failed woefully because bayelsains are more informed than they imagined”.
