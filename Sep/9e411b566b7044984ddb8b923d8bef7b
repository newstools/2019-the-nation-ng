BUDDING gospel artiste, Sanmi Agunbiade, popularly known as Sanmi Crown, has commenced plans for his forthcoming birthday. Sanmi Crown will clock 40th birthday on Sunday, October 6 and, according to him, the celebrations will be a three-way event. “My forthcoming birthday is going to be a 3-in-1 celebration. The event is tagged, ‘Season of Freedom’ where I will be launching my book, an album and birthday party,” the talented gospel artiste said. “The book is titled, Never A Crime To Start Small, But It’s A Capital Crime To Remain Small and it’s all about the challenges youths face today. I discovered many youths have a big dream and they don’t want to start small. The book is to preach and motivate them that they can start small. I believe going into 40 is opening a new chapter just the Israelites in the Bible.” On his source of inspiration and role model, he described his father as the best in the world. “He was inspired to start singing as a teenager. From his retirement entitlement, my father gave money to record my debut album titled, “Gbejamija’ in 2007. Maybe, because he used to be a musician himself, he usually supports me financially, morally and spiritually.” Also, I actually appreciate a lot of artistes but I chose just three people as my role models; they are Baba Ara, Bisi Alawiye and Tope Alabi because their songs carried a strong message. Apart from these gospel acts, I also get inspired by King Sunny Ade, especially his dancing skills.” Sanmi Crown, who is a graduate of accountancy, said he intended to study music but was advised to choose accountancy. This is so he can secure a corporate job, music aside, “After I graduated, I tried to secure a job based on my profession but my effort was futile. That is why I channel my energy into my God-given talent, which is music.”
