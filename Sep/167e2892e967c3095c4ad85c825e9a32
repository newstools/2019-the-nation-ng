 Super Eagles left back Jamilu Collins was on target for his bundesliga side Paderborn but it was not enough to stop the side from going down 3-2 to bundesliga giants Bayern Munchen. Bayern grabbed two goals in 55 minutes thanks Serge Gnabry and Philippe Coutinho respectively. Paderborn first goal to reduce the tally came in the 68th minute through Kai Pröger but celebration over the goal did not last long before Robert  Lewandowski netted the third goal for the visitors. The game was heading for a 3-1 victory for Bayern before Jamilu Collins scored in the 84th minute to leave the score line at 3-2. The 25 year old who made Super Eagles national team debut in an international friendly against Libya at the Uyo Stadium, is set to feature in another high profile friendly after being named in the 23-man squad to face Brazil. Taiwo Awoniyi who was in action for Manz for about 14 minutes also suffered a lone goal defeat in the hands of visiting Wolfsburg. Both Paderborn and Manz occupy the bottom of the ladder in the 18-team Bundesliga log with only six matches played so far in the new season
