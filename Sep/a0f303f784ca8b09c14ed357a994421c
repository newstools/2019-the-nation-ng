THE Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Thursday announced the return of suspended Coach Salisu Yusuf, after serving a one-year ban for receiving bribe while in-charge of the CHAN Eagles. Yusuf was suspended for accepting a ‘cash gift’ of $1000 to play two players during Nigeria’s 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) campaign in Morocco. He was sanctioned by the NFF Ethics Committee with a fine of $5000 and a one-year ban from football-related activities. The NFF in statement confirmed the 57 year-old ex Enyimba coach’s return whilst thanking caretaker coach Imama Amapakabo for his services during Yusuf’s absence. “The Nigeria Football Federation has noted that the Chief Coach of the Super Eagles, Salisu Yusuf has now fully served the one–year suspension clamped on him last year. “The Federation thanked Coach Imama Amapakabo for his sterling efforts while in charge of the U23 National Team in the absence of the suspended Yusuf, and for eventually seeing to the team’s qualification for the U23 AFCON.” It is not yet known if Yusuf will return to his previous roles in charge of the Home Eagles and Olympic Eagles.
