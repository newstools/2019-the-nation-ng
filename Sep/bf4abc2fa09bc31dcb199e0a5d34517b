All eyes will be on Nigerian forward, David Okereke as he aims to kicks off his Champions League campaign on a bright note when Club Brugge host Turkish champions Galatasaray at the Jan Breydel Stadium tonight. David Okereke, who stars for Nigeria’s Under 23 side, joined Club Brugge as the most expensive signing in the last eight years after completing a €8m four-year deal from Italian Serie B outfit Spezia Calcio. Okereke, 22, has scored four goals in six games for Brugge who are second in Belgian first division. Also playing for Brugge is Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis who has played 5 times and scored two goals this season. Dennis recently made his debut for Nigeria when he came in for Samuel Chukwueze in the Super Eagles 2-2 draw with Ukraine.
