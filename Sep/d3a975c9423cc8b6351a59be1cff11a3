As Nigeria seeks diplomatic resolution on the attack of its nationals in South Africa,  indigenous carrier – Air Peace  on Wednesday offered to repatriate   those stranded. The offer, the airline, said was  a sign of  its solidarity with  President Muhammadu Buhari administration. The Chairman of the airline, Allen Onyema, made the announcement while sympathizing with the victims who lost their lives and properties in the attacks. According to him, the airline decided to bring back Nigerians in support of the action already taken by the federal government. In reaction to the attacks in South Africa, the Buhari administration has recalled Nigeria’s High Commissioner to South Africa. It also pulled out with some other African leaders who  pulled out of World Economic Summit taking place in Cape Town. In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on September 4, 2019, Air Peace expressed readiness to evacuate Nigerians who are willing to leave the country and said that the airline would dispatch its flights to Johannesburg once the arrangement has been completed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “The xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa are an unfortunate incident and we cannot fold our hands and watch our fellow Nigerians be killed by South Africans.
