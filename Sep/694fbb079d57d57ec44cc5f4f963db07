Suspected miscreants in Oshodi, who escaped police raid by the whiskers may have devised new plan to beat further arrest by law enforcement agents. No fewer than 71 suspected miscreants were arrested by personnel of the Lagos State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences on Wednesday. When our reporter visited the area on Thursday evening, a number of the boys were sighted loitering around the railway line. Sources said the boys now come around in the evening when personnel of the Lagos Task Force are not around to apprehend them. It was said that a number of them who escaped the recent police raid still sleep in shacks along the railway line. ‘’The boys no longer come out in the morning. They would go to other parts of the state and return in the evening from 7 PM when Task Force operative are no longer around. ‘’They still come around to smoke Indian hemp and indulge in pick pocketing as usual. Operatives of the Lagos Task Force would need to step up their surveillance in order to discourage the boys from regrouping to further their nefarious activities like snatching people’s bags and valuables here,’’ said a source who asked not to be named.
