Ogun State Government has organised free medical outreach for the people of Ilaro in fulfilment of its promise to provide effective health care delivery to the citizens. Governor Dapo Abiodun, while addressing the crowd who came out for the free medical test at Yewa Empire Ground, Ilaro, said ensuring good health of the citizens was paramount to his administration, adding that the programme was the third phase, as it had been conducted in Odeda and Ilisan-Remo. Represented by his deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, the governor said the people’s welfare was very fundamental, which informed the free health care delivery initiative. “It is very important for us to know our health status, as health is wealth. This medical outreach is meant to educate us more on the state of our health, to advise us on what to eat, when to rest and what steps to take when we notice any symptoms in our body system. “There is a disease called hepatitis, which is most common now. We have launched the sensitisation and conducted a test in Ota. Very soon, it will be brought to Ilaro so that our people can get tested to know their status,” he said The governor added that besides the free medical outreach, the government had inspected some roads in Ilaro. He said work would soon begin on some of the roads to enhance free flow of vehicular movement. The Olu of Ilaro and paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, who was represented by Chief Emmanuel Adeboye Sanu, praised the government for the kind gesture, saying money without sound health is nothing. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Health, Dr. Sade Adebanjo, commended the governor for fulfilling his electoral promises.
