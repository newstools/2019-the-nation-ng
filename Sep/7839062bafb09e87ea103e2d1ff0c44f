The bible verse in Proverb 22 vs 29 (KJV) says “Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men”. This verse aptly describes Dr. Akinwunmi Adeshina, one of Nigeria’s best exports to the world. His intelligence and brilliance cannot be over-emphasised. He has displayed his Midas touch in his dealings at every position he had occupied. Despite the recent negative image suffered lately by Nigerians over the recently released 80 names of suspected fraudsters on the FBI list in the Unites States of America and Saudi Arabia list of drug peddlers awaiting death row, the former minister for Agriculture and Rural Development has represented Nigeria well at the world stage, creating an image of patriotism, resilience, truth and steadfastness about Nigerians. The 2017 world food prize winner and the President of African Development Bank met world leaders like President Donald Trump, President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders at the just -concluded G7 Biarritz in France. Like the proverbial gold fish that has no hiding place in the water, he never failed to shine like a star at the just concluded G7 summit alongside French President and ace music sensation and Grammy award winner, Angélique Kidjo at a press briefing. The first class graduate of Agric Economics from Obafemi Awolowo University was able to woo Emmanuel Macron and other G7 world leaders to mobilise $251 million for a guarantee facility for AFAWA of the African Development Bank to leverage $3 billion financing for women in Africa. This will further strengthen and support women educationally, as well as make them independent and financially stable.
