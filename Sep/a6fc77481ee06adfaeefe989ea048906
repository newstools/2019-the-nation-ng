The evacuation of next batch of Nigerians in South Africa is likely to be on Saturday, it has been learnt. 187 Nigerians, made up of 30 children, were lifted from the OR Tambo International Airport on Johannesburg on Wednesday. It was also gathered the collation of names for the intending returnees is ongoing. Confirming the date of the next flight, President of Nigerian Citizen Association, South Africa (NICASA), Prince Ben Okoli, said: “We are busy doing the collating of names of intending returnees for the next flight. Hopefully according to the Consul General the next evacuation will be done on Saturday. “It is not true that anyone was refused departure to Lagos because of any immigration matter. “Yes it is true that some had immigration matters but that was quickly fixed by the Consul General who was on the scene to ensure their smooth evacuation.” Over 600 Nigerians had indicated interest to return to Nigeria following the recent xenophobic attacks on other nationals in South Africa. The gesture of the Air Peace management to provide free airlift also helped in facilitating their return.
