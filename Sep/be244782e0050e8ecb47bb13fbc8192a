Festus Keyamo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), on Tuesday spoke on his deployment from the Niger Delta Affairs Ministry as Minister of State to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. He said the redeployment had offered him a fresh opportunity to prove his versatility. Reacting to the development, Keyamo tweeted that he is ready to serve the Buhari government in any capacity. “On the move again: Two portfolios in two months! Just been redeployed to the Ministry of Labour and Employment to work with my long-time big brother, H.E, Chris Ngige. Thank you, Mr. President for finding me versatile enough to move around. Always ready to serve in any capacity,” Keyamo tweeted. Keyamo is swaping offices with Senator Tayo Alasoadura. President Muhammadu Buhari approved the immediate redeployment of the two ministers of state in a statement by Willie Bassey, the Director of Information in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF). The redeployment, according to the statement, took effect from yesterday. Until the redeployment, Keyamo paired with Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio and Alasoadura, with Dr. Chris Ngige in the Labour and Employment Ministry. No reason was given for the redeployment of the ministers.
