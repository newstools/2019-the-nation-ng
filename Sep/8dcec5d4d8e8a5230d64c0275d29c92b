This is the third time Seyi will be serving as the Head of House. He got 250 Bet9ja coins, bonus coins for his Team and the Head of House Bedroom privileges which he refused to share with anyone. With his emergence as the Head of house, Seyi also secured a spot in the final week and stands a chance of being the last housemate standing.

Here is how housemates nominated: Mercy – Tacha and Omashola Elozonam – Tacha and Frodd Ike – Cindy and Elozonam Tacha – Cindy and Elozonam Frodd – Mercy and Mike Cindy – Diane and Ike Omashola – Elozonam and Mercy Mike – Frodd and Tacha Diane – Mike and Tacha Seyi – Ike and Mercy After the nominations, Biggie told the housemates that the Veto power holder nullifies all housemates’ decisions. He, therefore, told Frodd to put up five housemates of his choice up for eviction. This means other housemates are unaware that their nominations are invalid.
