TOP comedians Broda Shaggy, Helen Paul, Yaw, among many others, have been listed to perform at the maiden edition of Naija FM’ OAP, Ifektive’s Home-coming Concert. The event will hold tomorrow, Sunday September 8, at the Cubicle Events center, Isheri, Alimosho, Lagos. Speaking about the event, the organiser, Ifektive, said most comedy shows are done on the island but 70% attendants are from the mainland, which is why he thinks it should take a turn this time. “We thought that we should bring this same premium comedy show to the people and that is what I’m doing with Home-coming”, said Ifektive. “A lot of time people travel from that mainland to the island for comedy shows and most times when the show ends at the middle of the night,  quite a number of people don’t get to go home, they just stay there till: the morning. So, how about bringing this to the mainland and you can still go back to your home after the show? “The good thing is that you will still get the same premium event; it will be fine the same way it’s being done on the island. The multi-talented comedian and film maker stated that the audience will experience a whole new content from him and other performing comedians. “What differentiate this show is the content; a lot of people know that Ifektive is a content king. I do content for a lot of people. This is going to be different and I can assure you that the comedians will crack new sets of jokes because they know they are meeting a new set of audience”. Other comedians slated for the concert include Ali Baba, Koffi, Funnybone, Nedu, Acapella, Senator, while Jaywon and Sound Sultan will be dishing out good music.
