One of the most common problems arising from sleep is sustained stretching of muscles and joint structures while adopting awkward positions during sleep. Sleep is a natural phenomenon and cannot be dismissed for a long period. Whether travelling in a car or plane, working on your desk, driving and many other situations, sleep can overcome you. The position taken during sleep could lead to pain in many joints of the body. A joint is formed by at least two bones connected by a tissue called cartilage. Together, the bone and cartilage allow movement and stretching at a joint. Muscles are also attached to joints and when muscles contract, movement of the bone where the muscle is attached takes place. You can do a little experiment to observe the effect of sustained stretch of muscle, ligaments and other structures at a joint. Move the small joint in one of your fingers backward and hold it for a minute. After a few seconds you will feel a dull pain which becomes sharp when the stretch reaches a minute. If you release the joint the pain disappears after a few seconds or minute depending on how much stretch was applied. However, if the joint is held for hours and this has daily occurrence, the pain may become permanent and require attention of health professionals. The above mechanism is exactly what happens to shoulders, neck, low back, hips and knees when we place them in awkward positions during sleep. When you sleep in a car or plane and rest your head on the window or back of the seat that does not have neck or head support, you are likely going to overstretch your neck ligaments and muscles. A prolonged period will lead to reversible neck pain while a routine and continuous stretch will lead to a medical condition that may require help. The same applies to people that sleep on a single sitter couches with hips and knees tucked in. These are prone to hip and or knee pain.
