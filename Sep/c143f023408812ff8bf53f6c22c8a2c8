A former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, has rejected the outcome of the just-concluded primary election in Bayelsa State using a direct mode. Lokpobiri said it was still trying to get details of what transpired in Bayelsa insisting that he and his team never participated in any primaries that declared David Lyon the flag bearer of the party. Lokpobiri, who is a frontline APC aspirant in the state said there was no way he would be defeated in any election in Bayelsa by Lyon adding that the majority members of the APC were supporting him. He wondered why a primary was said to have started in a hotel in Yenagoa and ended in the hotel sidelining the secretariat of the party in the state. He said party members gathered at the secretariat in Yenagoa and waited in vain for the arrival of the committee saddled with the conduct of the primaries. He also queried why a result was purportedly declared by someone other than the Returning Officer and Governor of Yobe State, who chaired the committee. Lokpobiri expressed optimism that the national leadership of the would look into the development in Bayelsa and ensure a credible process that would throw up a popular candidate for the APC. The former minister said there are hundreds of thousands of APC members in the state noting that it was not possible for a direct primary to produce less than 45000 voters as purpotedly announced in Bayelsa.
