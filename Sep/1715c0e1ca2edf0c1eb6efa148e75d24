Governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Preye Aganaba, has asked the High Court in Yenagoa to void the primaries that produced Chief David Lyon as the party’s candidate for the November 16 governorship election. Aganaba sued APC, Lyon and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the court as defendants in a suit he personally filed on September 12. He urged the court to declare that the September 4 primaries did not hold. Aganaba also asked the court to declare that since there were no primaries, the declaration of results which produced Lyon as the party’s flag bearer was illegal, unconstitutional, null, void and of no effect. He also demanded an order setting aside the results of primaries, and sough an order ‘restraining the APC from presenting Lyon or submitting his name to INEC as its candidate’. Other reliefs sought by Aganaba are: “An order restraining INEC from receiving, acting on, publishing or listing Lyon as the governorship candidate of APC; an order restraining Lyon from parading himself as or holding himself out as the candidate of the APC in the Bayelsa State governorship election.”
