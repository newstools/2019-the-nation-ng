GOLDEN Eaglet assistant coach Nduka Ugbade has revealed that all the tactical errors in the team will be corrected ahead of the World Cup to ensure that Nigeria put up a good performance in Brazil. He also commended UEFA for organizing the mini tournament in Turkey, stating that It has helped the Eaglets improve. In a telephone interview with NationSport, he said: “The boys are performing well in Turkey with some minor mistakes noticed. “These mistakes will be corrected in the last three weeks of preparations for the team to become stronger in attack as well as defence. The team must maintain the balance between attacking and defending to put us in winning position always. We also want the midfield to be very compact and strong.” Nduka added: “Yes, I think the UEFA Assist competition is very good for us to measure our strength and technical ability to manage World Cup game situations. I would want to thank UEFA for this Assist programme. It has helped us a lot to see our players individually, collectively and most of the things we must improve upon. “I really thank the organizers for making the tournament possible. And to the Turkish Football Federation, I say a big thank you for giving us this opportunity to see this TFF Training Center. With this, you have shown to the world that it is possible to do great things.” The FIFA Under 17 World Cup will kick off in Brazil on October 26. Meanwhile, the Golden Eaglets will tackle Senegal today in their third game at the UEFA/CAF Assist Tourney.
