Chelsea young star Callum Hudson-Odoi has reportedly signed a new five-year contract worth £180,000-a-week with the Blues after long speculation over his future. Billy Gilmour has also penned a new four-year deal with the club after making his first-team breakthrough. The 18-year-old winger Hudson-Odoi , broke into the scene for Chelsea last season, showing himself to be one of the most exciting young talents in the country. The England international was set to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge, but similar stories have been doing the rounds for some time with no official announcement. Hudson-Odoi’s potential has also seen him linked as a transfer target for Bayern Munich, so it’s vital Chelsea can tie him down soon. According to a reliable source on Chelsea youth, Frank Khalid, Hudson-Odoi has now put pen to paper, with an announcement apparently set to follow soon. Fans will hope this proves accurate as he has quickly become a real fan-favourite at the club. And with a tough start to the season for new manager Frank Lampard, he could really do with good news like this to give everyone a lift. He is working his way back to full fitness having suffered an Achilles injury towards the end of last season, and he’s expected to be back available for selection this month. With Eden Hazard leaving for Real Madrid in the summer, he could end up being an ideal long-term replacement in attack. Tammy Abraham is likely to be rewarded with improved terms after his impressive start to the season, having netted four goals in just four league games. Fikayo Tomori and Reece James are another two players who could be offered better deals to keep them at Stamford Bridge.
