Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his victory at the Election Petition Tribunal. “Given the unprecedented margin of victory that Mr. President recorded in our state, Kwara, and the very glaring acceptability of his candidature across the country, I have always known that any legal challenge to his victory was just an academic exercise because the people have spoken clearly. “Without prejudice to the right of the opposition to seek redress as they did, the judgment of the presidential election tribunal only affirmed the position of the people of Nigeria who appreciate the discipline, integrity, patriotism, and commitment of Mr. President to a better Nigeria,” he said. In a statement in Ilorin, the state capital, by his spokesperson Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor said the tribunal’s judgment was a victory for the ordinary Nigerian who stood for many hours on the queue to cast their ballot in the election. AbdulRazaq also lauded the erudition of the President’s legal team, saying they remained focus “even in the face of everyday propaganda by the opposition”. He urged Nigerians to rally round the President to deliver more dividends of democracy.
