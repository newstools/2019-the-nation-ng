The suspected kidnapper, Alhaji Hamisu Bala Wadume is still in Police custody. The suspect who was freed by Army personnel and later re-arrested by operatives of the Nigeria Police Force is presently in Police custody. Also, several people have been arrested in the last few days in connection to crimes led by him. A source close to the investigation told The Nation that the police have enough evidence to commence his prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction. The source said: “Wadume is still with the police. We have also made several arrest since his re-arrest by our men. Even up to yesterday (Saturday), some people were arrested in connection with the role they played in helping Wadume carry out his terrible acts. “Investigation is seriously ongoing at the moment and we already have enough evidence to prosecute him but we don’t want to be seen to be ahead of the panel that was set up. Going forward without the final report from the panel will show that we are preempting the outcome.” On how far the panel has gone with its investigation, he said: “The panel have rounded up their seating and they are at the stage of writing their findings.”
