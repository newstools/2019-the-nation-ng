SUPER Eagles forward Victor Osimhen was on target once again for his French Ligue 1 side Lille Wednesday night as they beat Strasbourg 2-0 at the  Stade Pierre-Mauro.  The former Wolfsburg ace shot his club into the lead in the 43rd minute of the game to the delight of teeming club supporters. Teammate Remmy Loic increased the tally for the home side in the 64th minute after enjoying an assist from Osimhen thus handing Lille two goals and three points. Osimhen who joined the side in July this year making a debut against Nantes and scoring a brace in that encounter, has now netted six goals with only six matches played in the new season. Compatriots Samuel Kalu was also on target in Boardeaux’s 3-1 win over Amiens SC while Moses Simon played full 90 minutes in Nantes lone goal victory over Rennes.
