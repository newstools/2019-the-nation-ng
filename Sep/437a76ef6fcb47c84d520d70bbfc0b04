The directive which was originated from the Department of Operations at the Force Headquarters in Abuja, said the IGP was shocked and extremely disturbed about the unprofessional manner police formations, officers were being attacked and killed. It also frowned at the way their weapons were being carted away without any form of resistance from the cops. “This is simply indicative of the unprofessionalism, unpreparedness and lack of supervision on the part of personnel deployed by the Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) and Area Commanders (ACs). “Recent incidents in mind are the attacks on a PMF mini base in Kebbi during which about eight rifles were carted away without any form of resistance.
