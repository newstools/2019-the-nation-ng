Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting to hold on to power, as voters go to the polls in one of its closest election races in years. He called the snap election after failing to form a governing coalition in the wake of an election in April. Polls forecast his right-wing Likud party to tie with its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party led by former military chief Benny Gantz. Smaller parties could, therefore, have a big say in the final outcome. Netanyahu lashed out at Facebook (FB.O) yesterday after the social network blocked a “chatbot” from his right-wing Likud party’s account for violating election day rules. “They took a 100 kg hammer and brought it down on a fly, because it is a Likud fly,” Netanyahu said in a video posted on social media. “They shut down our means of communication with our voters.” Israel’s leading YNET news website said the chatbot, a type of automated software that is able to simulate a conversation with a user, had posted results from an election poll yesterday while Israelis were out voting, a contravention of election rules. The problematic posts were apparently taken down and no longer appeared on Netanyahu’s Facebook page. Negotiations on the formation of a new coalition are expected to start as soon as voting ends at 22:00 (19:00 GMT) and exit polls are published. Likud and Blue and White came away with 35 seats each in the 120-seat Knesset. Netanyahu declared victory and it appeared that he would be able to secure a majority with the backing of smaller right-wing and religious parties. But after several chaotic weeks, the attempted coalition-building collapsed into recriminations. On the surface was a dispute over Israel’s secular versus its religious character, says the BBC’s Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.
