Prominent Indigenes of Ogbomoso who have distinguished themselves in various fields of human endeavour will be honoured on Saturday. The organisers, the Ogbomoso Community Foundation (OCF), a social -cultural organisation, said the Night with Stars seeks to honour indigenes who have positively impacted the country, state and the Ogbomoso community. A statement by OCF leader General Oladayo Popoola (rtd), said it was to appreciate the recipients and further encourage them to do more for the community while encouraging others emulate them. “The idea is to honour some of these people in their life time. “Someone like Chief Lere Paimo, popularly called Eda Onileola, who turned 80 years old recently, should be honoured for his great contribution to the entertainment industry in the country. “It is better to honour people like him in their lifetime to show how they are appreciated,” the statement said. Others awardees are Late Chief Ogundare Foyanmu, whose unique poetic chants popularised Ijala Ode; the Gongo Aso crooner,  Akande Abolore (9ice); Alhaji Ramoni Akanni (RKI),  Kolawole Ajoyemi, Alhaji Wasiu Agara, Benedict Ayoolaa, and Prince Femi Oyewumi. Dr. Samson Adegoke (Maigida), whose impactful donation of a community maternity centre and e-library to the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), will be honoured, among others.
