Chief Modestus Umenzekwe is a chieftain of All Progressives Congress APC in Anambra State. In this interview with Nwanosike Onu, he speaks on President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the tribunal, the issue of IPOB, the achievements of the APC government in the Southeast region and how his party is making preparations to take over Anambra State in 2021. Excerpts Let me ask you, how possible was it to dislodge PDP at the federal level? It’s a matter of planning; I’m not going to tell you what we are going to do, but we are doing a lot and you will see it manifest in a very clean, clear and credible election.
Ex-Governor Peter Obi of PDP has become a political enigma, how’s your party going to deal with such characters?
Peter Obi was there before Buhari won election. Yes, he’s revered, a respected leader; he is somebody I like but don’t forget, that Senator Chris Ngige started this, he’s a special oracle and we know that he knows what to do when it comes to that . After all, did he dislodge APGA? He’s an oracle, yet, APGA still won, so nothing is impossible in politics, just like in football .
