Super Eagles forward Alex Iwobi was in action for 35 minutes as Everton suffered home defeat in the hands of Sheffield United on Saturday in front of their disappointed fans. Iwobi who joined the Toffees in a five year deal early August came in as late substitute for Frenchman Morgan Schneiderlin in the 55th minute. It was a day that appeared to have Chosen to be nightmarish for the Goodison Park landlords following an own goal by Everton Defender Yina Mina in the 40th minute. The early goal no doubt hit Everton below the belt and was a rather a shocker to the homers who controlled lion share possession in the ratio of 72 to 28% unfortunately all the efforts made to translate the effort into an equaliser failed to materialise. The Situation was further compounded for the homers when Lys Mousset scored the second goal for Sheffield United who from that point ensured they never blinked in the defence guarding their lead jealously to the end. Sheffield United duo celebrate Everton defeat Saturday’s defeat marks the third in Everton’s four premier league outings this season. Toffee fans did not find the defeat funny as many of them walked out before the end of the match while those who stayed behind voiced their displeasure at full time. Everton went into Saturday’s match fresh from a 3-1 defeat by AFC Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium. Interestingly the Nigerian international was in action for full 90 minutes in that encounter. The Marco Silva tutored side have a Tuesday date with Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup and  Sheffield Wednesday may be hoping   to continue where Sheffield United stopped.
