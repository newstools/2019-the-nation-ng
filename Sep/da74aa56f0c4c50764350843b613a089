A member of a vigilante and two others on Wednesday sustained gunshot injuries in an altercation between Policemen and some members of the Vigilante group in main market, Onitsha, Anambra state. The police were said to have gone to a plaza in the market named “Our lord plaza” to arrest a trader who allegedly bought a phone from a suspect who came with the police to point the trader he sold the phone to. The Nation gathered that the traders, angry over what they suspected to be conspiracy with the police, tried to prevent the police from arresting their colleague, insisting they must report to their leadership before he would be taken away. The traders action was said to have provoked the police who reportedly shot sporadically into the air which resulted in the gun shots injury by the victims. Confirming the incident, the Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed said the victims were taken to the hospital and were responding to treatment. He said, “There was an altercation between Policemen who went on inquiry at “our lord plaza” in Onitsha Main Market and some Vigilante group today at about 1:30pm. “As a result, a Vigilante member was shot on the leg and two other persons also sustained injuries. “Situation was brought under control through the concerted efforts of the Police led by the Area Commander Onitsha and market leaders. “Normalcy has been restored and people are going about their lawful business. “Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police CP John B.
