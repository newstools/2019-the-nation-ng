SUPER Eagles’ captain, Ahmed Musa has charged the U-23 National Team, Olympic Eagles, to go all out and make the nation proud as the team intensified preparations for the final round of this year’s U-23 AFCON qualifiers against Sudan. Musa made the call when he showed up at the team’s training session at the FIFA Goal Project in Abuja on Sunday night. The Eagles’ skipper added that with hard work and dedication, the team can beat Sudan in Omdurman to stand a bright chance to qualify for the forthcoming U-23 AFCON in Egypt. “I am here to encourage and pledge my support to you due to the importance of the game ahead of you. I have played for the U-23 before making my debut for the Super Eagles in 2010, and with dedication, hard work and grace of God, today I’m the Super Eagles’ captain. “Nigeria is blessed with a lot of talented footballers. I am the captain of the Super Eagles not because I am better than most of the players but due to dedication and hard-work. I urge you to go all out and beat Sudan because the game serves as Olympic qualifiers.” The Imama Amapakabo-led team is expected to depart the shores of the country early next week, with the first leg billed for Thursday, 5th September at the Al Merriekh Stadium in Omdurman. The return leg will hold in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday, 10th September. Winners over two legs between Nigeria and Sudan will qualify for the 3rd Africa U-23 Cup of Nations, scheduled for Egypt 8th – 22nd November this year.
