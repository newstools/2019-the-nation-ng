A member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) in Lagos State, Chief Lanre Razak, has advocated prompt payment of taxes and other charges by Lagosians, to enable the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration implement its THEME agenda, provide infrastructure, houses, electricity and other amenities. He rated the governor high in service delivery in the first 100 days, saying a strong financial base is imperative for the government to accelerate socio-economic development, raise the people’s living standard and achieve the ‘Greater Lagos’ project. In a statement on Wednesday, Razak, the Balogun General of Epe and ex-Commissioner for Public Transportation, said Governor Sanwo-Olu has not only constituted his executive council (exco), but also raised the bar in governance by addressing challenges such as gridlock, refuse disposal, deplorable roads and insecurity. The All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart noted that Governor Sanwo-Olu, through Executive Orders targeted at traffic management and environmental sanitation, has ameliorated the chaotic vehicular situation as well as poor refuse collection and evacuation that were the lot of the state prior to his assumption of office. Sanwo-Olu, during electioneering campaign as APC’s governorship candidate, promised to anchor his administration on the five major pillars of THEME- traffic management and transportation; health and environment; education and technology; making Lagos a 21st century economy and entertainment & tourism as well as other programmes. Assessing the governor’s performance so far, Razak said besides constituting a formidable exco that will drive the administration, Sanwo-Olu has impacted positively in such critical areas as rehabilitation of many bad roads, improved traffic situation engendered by well- motivated personnel of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), resuscitated work on the abandoned Mile 2-Badagry expressway and elevating the state’s security architecture to safeguard lives and property.
