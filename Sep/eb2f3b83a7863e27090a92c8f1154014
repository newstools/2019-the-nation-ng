Ibadan-based radio station Fresh 105.9FM, has clinched the award of the Best Radio Station of the Year. The station, owned by renowned musician, Dr. Yinka Ayefele, beat nine other stations to clinch the position at the 13th edition of the Nigeria Media Nite-Out Awards (NMNA) which held on Sunday at the Lagos Airport Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos. It was a big achievement for the four-year-old radio station, being the first station to win the award outside Lagos State. A Director in the company, Mr. David Ajiboye, said he was  elated that the station could win such a highly- coveted award within four years. “When we were adjudged the best radio station in the Southwest, we thought we’ve reached the pinnacle,” he said. “But with this now, it means we need to work harder so we can still retain it next year. We’ve seen television stations winning it back-to-back, so, I will say this award will only prepare us to work harder so it won’t be a one-off thing.” Other stations nominated alongside Fresh FM in the Radio Station of the Year category were Najia FM, Lagos, Sobi FM, Ilorin, Express Radio, Kano, Coal City FM, Enugu, Albarka FM, Bauchi, Max FM, Lagos, Freedom FM, Abuja, Peoples FM, Bayelsa, Smooth FM and Inspiration FM, Lagos. The event was to celebrate those who have excelled and distinguished themselves in various fields of media.
