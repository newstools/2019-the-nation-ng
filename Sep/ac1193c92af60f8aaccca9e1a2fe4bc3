The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded a system-wide investigation into the alleged siphoning of N90 billion from the coffers of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in which top members of the Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been mentioned. A statement on Tuesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, cautioned that there should be no cover up of the alleged humongous corruption scandal, which the party said involved highly placed individuals. It lamented that in the face of excruciating hardship being endured by Nigerians, a government, which came into office on the mantra of change and zero tolerance for corruption, has become enmeshed in atrocious acts of corruption. Saying that the allegation speaks volumes of the character of the present administration, the party further stated that it’s unfortunate that a top member of the federal cabinet is being fingered in the alleged siphoning of monies collected as taxes from millions of impoverished Nigerians. “Our party notes that this shocking allegation directly borders on gross misconduct and breach of public trust. “The party, therefore, rejects the flimsy denials and threats being pushed through the FIRS as a belated attempt at cover-up by persons close to the Presidency. “It is therefore held that the delay by the Buhari Presidency in applying established statutory processes and procedures of ordering an investigation into the issue only goes to confirm that the Buhari administration is a citadel of corruption. “This is more so as reports are already in the public domain of how the money stolen from FIRS, was allegedly diverted to private purses and for other extraneous purposes, including the 2019 extravagant campaigns of the APC. “Nigerians expect that all our national resources should always be used to ensure the welfare of the citizenry and must be accounted for at all times”, the party said.
