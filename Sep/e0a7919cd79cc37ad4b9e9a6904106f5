Most Nigerians are suffering heart and kidney diseases for consuming wines and other alcoholic beverages made for extremely cold countries, it has been said. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) JAMEK Beverages James Iweh, who stated this, explained that a lot of the high-priced brands were tested in German laboratories and found to be too harsh for Nigerian residents. Imeh spoke at the weekend at the opening of a new distribution outlet on Ago Palace Way in Okota, Lagos State. The company chief executive said JAMEK was in the business to serve Nigerians quality drinks. He said it was not surprising the company was the sole importer of German brands, including Dr. Zenzen and premiere producers of the cocktail concentrates, quality wine and spirits approved by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). “Our wines are produced to soothe our weather because we make it in compliance with best recommendations. There are so many wines in Nigeria today that are too harsh because of the hot weather. But if you drink JAMEK wine, you will see how smooth it is because it won’t give you a headache or heartburn. “Germany, where we produce our wine, is known for not compromising quality. Our wines may not be the same price with other wines in the market but we are after the quality of the product and not the quantity. “Again, whenever I want to produce any wine, I get sample of different wines and take it to Germany and we analyse it, I can tell you today that there are some spirits that people drink in Nigeria that are made for countries whose whether are cold. If I want to produce any spirit, I will make sure it won’t harm your health by giving you heartburn or work against your kidney,” Imeh said.
