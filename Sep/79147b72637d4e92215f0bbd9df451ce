THE Edo State governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is intact and insisted that only God makes leaders and not men, despite plans of some persons to cause disunity in the party. Obaseki who said this while passing a vote of confidence in the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, who is the party’s leader in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state, declared that his administration is working with the state APC structure and delivering result to Edo people. Obaseki’s visit to the SSG in his house in Benin City, yesterday, coincided with the visit of Ikpoba Okha youths, who also paid a solidarity visit to their leader. The governor said his administration is working with the state APC structure to make the state chapter of the party the strongest in the country, adding that thuggery would not be allowed in the party and in the whole of Edo State. According to him, his administration would not be distracted by the antics of some few members of the party and would continue to deliver good governance to citizens of the state. The APC Youth Leader in Ikpoba-Okha LGA, Mukhtar Yusuf-Osagie, said the SSG has been a good and hospitable leader since he served as Chief of Staff. Hon. Princess Taiye Obanor, a leader in Ward 7, Ikpoba-Okha, commended Ogie for being a true grassroots leader, adding, “We are here to pay a solidarity visit to our leader, and we are happy to have the governor join in the celebration.”
