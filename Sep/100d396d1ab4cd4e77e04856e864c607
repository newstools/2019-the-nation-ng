The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) will soon deliver additional assistance to Daura community in Katsina State, which was hit by massive floods last week. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said contrary to the allegations that President Muhammadu Buhari has turned his back on the people of Daura, pre-assessment relief materials were dispatched to the victims within 48 hours of the floods. He said: “Ten trailer loads of building materials, including zinc, planks and cement, as well as tons of grains, cereals and other edibles have so far been delivered. “The flood victims also received blankets and mattresses. “Materials were delivered to and signed for by stakeholders while the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Faruk Umar, welcomed the prompt emergency response from NEMA officials.” NEMA, he said, has equally promised that in line with establishment practices all over the country, as soon as the assessment of the damage to the flood-ravaged communities is reported, more food items and building materials would be dispatched.
