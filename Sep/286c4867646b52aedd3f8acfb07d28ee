PAOK center-forward Chuba Akpom has announced that he has chosen to represent Nigeria on the international level after having represented England in the youth levels. Akpom is a graduate of Arsenal’s academy and was promoted to the first team in 2013 after impressing with the U-18s. He made just 12 appearances with Gunners as he was loaned-out on several occasions joining the likes of Nottingham Forrest, Hull City, Brighton and Belgium’s Saint-Truiden. The 23-year-old then signed for Greek powerhouse PAOK on a permanent deal and managed to lift the domestic league title and the Greek Cup in his first season. Also, on the international level, he represented England on all youth levels, from the under 16s to the under 21s, making a total of 41 appearances along the way. However, after failing to represent the Three Lions’ senior team, Akpom announced that he will switch allegiance and play for African giants Nigeria. “I’ve only just recently switched my allegiance, so I’ve signed the documents and hopefully in the next few weeks it will be approved to enable me play for Nigeria,” Akpom told BBC Sport. “I’ve been wanting to do that for many years now but not many people know this. It’s just been a matter of sorting it out, which is now in a process. I’m looking forward to it. “It was a personal decision. I’m Nigerian and my whole family feel very Nigerian and it will be nice to represent Nigeria. “It will also be nice to link up with Alex Iwobi again and play for the national team. We started playing when we was younger together and to make that step to play for the national team together will be amazing,” he stated.
