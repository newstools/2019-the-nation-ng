Over N5m was lost yesterday morning when 16 cows died at Mosolashi bus stop along Lagos Abeokuta Expressway. The accident happened around 6:30am while a fully loaded mass-carrier bus popularly called ‘molue”  and a lorry packed with 32 cows collided. The bus was heading to Oshodi area of Lagos State, while the lorry was heading to Abattoir when the accident happened. The Nation gathered that the drivers of both vehicles were trying to avoid a deep pothole at Mosolashi bus stop when the accident happened, triggering a traffic snarl for hours. A security official said the accident happened around 6:30 am. He said the truck was conveying cows from Shaki in Oyo State and was heading to  Abattoir in Ogun state. “There is a big pot hole here in Mosolashi bus stop. The lorry carrying the cows first partially hit the bus breaking some of its glass, all the passengers ran out of the bus and there was no loss of life. It was while the lorry driver was trying to prevent further falling on the bus and was trying to move out of the pot hole that it fell and 16 of the  cows died on the spot. The lorry driver fled the scene and was no where to be found.” He said the people from Abatior came to remove the remaining cows that were alive. He said officials of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Response Unit of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and the police from Alagbado cleared the environment. The owner of the lorry, Sulaimon Olarenwaju said the 16 cows that died were worth over N5m. Olanrewaju said the police who towed his lorry to the Alagbado station were yet to release it to him. “It was not as if the lorry driver intentionally caused the accident, the pothole caused it, I dont know why my lorry is not released, they should please release my lorry and not ask me to pay for it,” he said.
