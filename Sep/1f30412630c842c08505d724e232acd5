The Simba Group has opened a state-of-the-art showroom and first of its kind in Nigeria, for their range of TVS motorcycles and tricycles at Garki, Abuja. The Simba TVS Centre offers customers a one-stop-shop solution for vehicles, accessories, spare parts and service. The showroom was inaugurated by the immediate past Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Senator Omotayo Alasoadura, Director General of the National Directorate of Employment, Dr Nasir Ladan Mohammed Argungu and Dr Mohammed Bello Umar Tambuwal, Permanent Secretary- Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Chairman of Simba Group, Chief Vinay Grover said: “Simba has always been committed to social and economic development, and our motorcycles and tricycles strike at the heart of this philosophy – driving millions of Nigerians to work, to school, to pray and to get on with their daily lives; and in turn, driving the economy. Besides all those employed by us directly, our products generate employment for millions of people in the country – right from the drivers of our motorcycles and tricycles, to the dealers, micro finance partners and fleet owners that make them available, and finally to the tens of thousands of mechanics who provide after-sales-service for them. “It’s with this in mind, that we were honored to invite our Chief Guests today, not only to inaugurate the Simba TVS Center but also to celebrate the accomplishments of the company in this regard.” The showroom featured the latest motorcycles and tricycles from TVS, including the recently launched TVS King Duramax – a tricycle enhanced with a higher power, and more efficient, Duralife engine which leads to longer vehicle life and stronger performance. Also on display is the TVS XL 100, dubbed the ‘Oga for Load’ due to its suitability for rural and in particular farming, applications.
