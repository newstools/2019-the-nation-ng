Napoli have signed veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente on a free transfer. The 34-year-old was a free agent after leaving Tottenham at the end of last season and returns to Italy four years after leaving Serie A champions Juventus. “Benvenuto Fernando,” said Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis when announcing the move on Twitter. A number of clubs were linked with a move for Llorente over the summer, including Fiorentina and Manchester United. Tottenham were also reportedly considering re-signing the striker but Carlo Ancelotti’s side have won the race for his signature. No details have been released but reports over the weekend suggested Llorente had agreed a two-year deal worth around €2.5 million per season. Llorente spent two seasons in Serie A with Juventus between 2013 and 2015, scoring 27 goals in 97 appearances. Prior to that Llorente had spent nine seasons with Athletic Club having come through the Basque club’s youth system. After leaving Juve, Llorente spent one season back in La Liga, scoring seven goals in 36 appearances for Sevilla. He then moved to the Premier League, scoring 15 goals in 35 appearances for Swansea to help the Welsh club escape relegation. His performances for the Swans prompted Tottenham to hand him a two-year deal in the summer of 2017, with Llorente going on to score 13 goals in 66 appearances for Mauricio Pochettino’s side before his release this summer. Napoli, runners-up in Serie A last season, have spent in excess of £100 million ($121m) on new players as they attempt to overhaul Juventus.
