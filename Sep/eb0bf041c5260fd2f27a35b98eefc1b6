The Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, has said that it is too early for the presidency to weigh in on the prosecution of detained publisher of Sahara Reporter, Omoyele Sowore, by the Department of State Services. He spoke during a live political programme Politics Today aired on Channel television. The presidential spokesman said that Sowore’s prosecution was still unravelling within the realms of the security and judiciary. He said: “It is an issue that is unraveling and I think it is still in the realm of security and judiciary. The DSS has a spokesman in Peter Afunanya. If you ask him this question I m sure he will be able to respond.” Adesina said that he had not been briefed by President Muhammadu Buhari on the stand of the presidency. He said: “As we are now I think it is premature for the presidency to weigh into this matter but when the presidency speaks it should be the final position on this. “The President had been away. He came into the country yesterday. I have not been briefed. If he says this is our position on this matter then I can speak on it. “Because I have not been briefed I won’t be able to say much but I am sure as a media house if you try to speak with the spokesman of the DSS he may oblige.” The presidential spokesman added that only the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami was in the best person to respond to some of the questions posed to him by the anchor.
