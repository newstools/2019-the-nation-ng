The Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Naval Command (ENC), Rear Admiral David Adeniran, has pledged the commitment of the command to ensuring a peaceful and crime-free waterway in the area. He spoke on Tuesday at the launch of the 2019 sea demonstration exercise for personnel of the command code-named ‘yangha mi’, an Ibibio language meaning “rescue me or save me”. It was held at the Ocean Terminal Jetty at Onne in Elements Local Government Area of Rivers State. Adeniran said ‘yangha mi’ is meant to dislodge criminals on the waterways, limit their activities in the command’s areas of responsibility and strengthen the achievements of other sea exercises initiated by the command against criminals. He added that they are just one out of several other operations of the command to ensure maritime safety and security, to boost the nation’s economy. “Sea exercise is one of the numerous operational engagements of the command. Others going on are ‘Operation Dekamor’ (calm water), ‘Swift Response’, among others. “These operations are aimed at ensuring maritime safety and security in the maritime environment. The gains of these engagements can be seen in the decrease in piracy and sea robbery, militancy, kidnapping, crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism, thus, there has been increase in shipping activities, crude oil production and other forms of economic activities of the citizens. “In the light of the foregoing, exercise ‘yangha mi’ is meant to consolidate on the gains so far achieved. Accordingly, the exercise will be conducted in the entire Eastern Naval Command area of responsibility and some parts of the command’s area of responsibility from September 3 to 6,” Adeniran said.
