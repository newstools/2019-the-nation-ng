ANTHONY Joshua has been tipped as a strong favourite with bookmakers to regain the WBA, WBO, IBO and IBF heavyweight titles which he lost to Ruiz, when they meet in a purpose-built arena in Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh. But Ruiz will not be taking anything lightly. “I don’t underestimate any fighter,” Ruiz said. “I know AJ’s going to come stronger and more focused but inside the gym, as Mike Tyson says, everyone has a plan until they get hit. “I’m sure everybody was trying to look for an excuse and the reason why he didn’t perform and why he lost. I think it was down to the style. Styles make fights and I’ve been calling AJ out for a while. I knew his style was perfect for me and that’s why I plan to do the same thing.” Ruiz has been showing off some of his many purchases since becoming world champion, including a new home, but he insists that is not a sign that he has lost focus on his career.
