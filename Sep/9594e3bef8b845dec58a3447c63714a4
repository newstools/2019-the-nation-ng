The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has described as a step in the right direction, the current military operations in parts of Ogoniland, Rivers State to weed out criminals, vandals and cultists, who it says have turned the area into a river flowing with innocent people’s blood. MOSOP, in an online statement by its President, Chief Legborsi Pyagbara, declared that end must quickly come to the criminal activities in Ogoniland. The umbrella organisation of Ogoni people said: “While we commend the deployment of military personnel in Ogoniland, we urge that the operations be carried out within the ambit of the law and respect for the human rights of innocent citizens, so that unnecessary collateral damage will not be experienced. “We are calling on Ogoni people to remain peaceful, law abiding and support the legitimate operations. “We assure Ogoni people that we are monitoring the process to ensure that innocent lives are not lost. ‘’We will promptly take actions against any of such operations that lead to any unnecessary attack on innocent individuals.” MOSOP also stated that any breach of professional rule of engagement observed during the military operations should be reported to the appropriate military authorities and to the office of the umbrella organisation of Ogoni people.
