A business expert, Dr Nneka Ebru Okpe has stressed the need for Nigeria to develop culture of high standard in businesses. Dr Okpe who was once a facilitator of businesses between Turkey and Nigeria since 2015 and currently focusing on Nigerian market, especially in oil and gas and manufacturing sectors affirmed that knowing how to build and run a really solid business and be successful at it does not come easily. She said, “What gets an international business going is not just the novelty of the product or service but understanding how to build relationships across cultures and local distribution channels. “For businesses to have cordial relations and mutually profitable partnerships across continents as seen through import and export, countries and companies must rely on each other for particular goods and services. Dr. Okpe who handles a few companies that specialise in consultancy and export-import, currently runs Intrasolutions Consultancy which is aimed at expanding its focus on man power supply and IT services having created foreign and local partnerships with established companies. Dr Okpe who completed her PhD at the age of 26 with extensive research on the effect of culture in business success in emerging nations believes in women-in-business, women empowerment, sharing and transferring technology between developed and developing nations, creating a standard in manpower, business and services which all contributes to the growth of businesses.
