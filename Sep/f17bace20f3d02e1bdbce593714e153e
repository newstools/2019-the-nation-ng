The 74th President of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly Prof Tijjani Muhammad Bande, has urged Nigeria to work with other countries  to ensure world peace by prioritising access to qualitative education. He made the call at a public lecture held in his honour by students of Political Science, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS) to celebrate his new designations as well as immense contributions to the department. Bande, a former vice-chancellor of the institution, likened education to a tool for fighting insecurity anywhere. He noted that the spate of killings in the country is as a result of inequitable access to education.He therefore charged the government to prioritise education to ensure world peace. “We all have a duty to build this country. What we are doing is to project Nigeria in the best light and also for the country to contribute to world peace,”Bande said. “Education is one of the elements of the presidency of the 74th session. It is the key to world peace and development. Nigeria should work with other nations to bring quality and accessible education to all in order to ensure world peace,” he added.
