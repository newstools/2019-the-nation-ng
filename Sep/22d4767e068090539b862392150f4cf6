The Chief Executive Officer of CARS45, Mr Etop Ikpe has urged the Federal Government to formulate a policy that will make used cars available for purchase. Ikpe spoke when he led the management team of the firm a visit to The Nation’s Head Office in Lagos. The team was received by Editor,  Mr. Adeniyi Adesina According to him, many automobile users prefer used cars due to economic factors. He added that only one per cent of car buyers buy brand news cars. He said any policy on automobile that is directed at only new cars will not serve the interest of the generality of the people. According to him, the government’s policy on automobile should be tailored to the larger percentage of the citizens. He said CARS45 was out to bring transparency and consistency into the automobile sector. He noted that the thrust of the business is hinged on three principles – pricing, speed and safety and transparency. According to him, over 3,000 vehicles can be accessed on the firm’s online platform. Within three years of operation, Ikpe said CARS45 had become the largest online car sales firm in the country. “We have 90 retail points across the country with over 400 employees. We have outlets in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Benin, among others. We also have over 1000 dealers,” he said. He said the firm has introduced an emergency service to fix cars that develop a fault on the road. “Once we receive a call, we send our mechanic to go and fix it immediately. if it can’t be fixed on the spot, it would be towed to the workshop,” he said.
