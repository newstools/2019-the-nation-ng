The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it would use the National Identity Number issued by the National Identity Management Commission for the conduct of 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. JAMB Registrar, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, stated this when the Director of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms, Mr Dasuki Arabi, visited him at the headquarters of the board in Abuja. He said the introduction of the NIN to UTME was in line with the directive of the Federal Government that NIMC should be the primary data collection centre. He noted that the NIN would guard against all forms of registration infractions. The registrar, in a statement by the agency’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin on Sunday in Abuja, said the board has concluded arrangements with the NIMC to use NIN number as a pilot for 2020 UTME. Oloyede said the board would use both the NIN number and its Computer Based Test Centres for the 2020 UTME registration. Oloyede said: “In view of the compliance with the Federal Government’s directive that the NIMC should be the primary data collection centre, the board will be using the NIM number of prospective candidates for registration in the next exercise. The board is at the moment discussing with the NIMC to work out the grey areas for seamless implementation in the next exercise.” The BPSR DG, Arabi, urged JAMB to take advantage of the Self-Assessment Tool developed by the bureau to strengthen its capacity and render quality service to the public. He said: “The SAT facility enables organisations to assess themselves in terms of what they have done or not done. By so doing, gaps can be identified and solutions proffered in real time. The President has directed agencies to work together so as to improve the quality of services that are offered. “We are coming to work with JAMB and the NIMC to support and encourage them to migrate to the nation’s data ecosystem just the way the Nigerian Immigration Service has done.”
