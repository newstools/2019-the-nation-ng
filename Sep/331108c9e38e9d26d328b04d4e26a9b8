Mrs. Titilayo Fowokan takes over the mantle of leadership at the Society of Women in Taxation (SWIT) as the third chairperson of Lagos state chapter. Speaking at the investiture ceremony, Mr. Albert Folorunsho, Managing Consultant, Pedabo, said global tax drive has become a necessity because multinational enterprise are taking advantage of loopholes in local laws as well as exploiting gaps in taxation treaties where they exist for their benefits. Folorunsho stated that each country has its own tax system defined by its jurisdiction and national tax laws and the organisation of economic cooperation and development (OECD) and the United Nations tax model convention provide guides on how sovereign state should interact with each other. Speaking further Folorunsho said that dividend tax, multiplicity of taxation by various organs of government, lack of advance tax rulings on certain issues to provide to investors, wrong interpretation and application of tax laws, ambiguity in tax laws are some of the issues negatively affecting foreign direct investment in Nigeria.
