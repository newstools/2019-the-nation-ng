THE 11 DisCos said they would install about six million meters between 2019 and 2022. Fears about whether there are enough testing stations to handle the huge numbers were allayed by the Nigerian Electricity Management Service Agency (NEMSA) which assured  that it has decentralised its meter testing activities with the operationalisation of the Kaduna and Port Harcourt Meter Test Stations. NEMSA’s Managing Director, Peter Ewesor said the fear of cogestion was unfounded. “I don’t think the place will be congested because presently the six million meters that are going to be deployed are not going to be deployed in one year. They are staggered between this year and 2022. “We have plans to ensure that the meters they will be bringing, we have adequate resources to deal with them. We have three meter test stations; Oshodi is in Lagos. We have Meter Test Station in Kaduna. We have Meter Test Station in Port Harcourt. Definitely, all the MAPs and DisCos should go to the Meter Test Station close to their environment.”
