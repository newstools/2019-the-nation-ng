Hundreds of Kebbi youths on Monday took to the streets in the state capital, Birnin Kebbi to protest against the lingering electricity black out by Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO). The protest paralysed commercial and economic activities in the capital. The youths marched along major roads in Birnin Kebbi chanting “enough is enough ‘; ‘ Our businesses are suffering ‘ and ‘ Bring Back our light ‘ among others. They had a brief stopover at the main entrance of Government House before marching to the main KEDCO head office in Birnin Kebbi to register their anger. One of the protesting youths, Muhammad Abdullahi, a tailor from Nasarawa area, expressed utter anger over what he described as deliberate attempt by KEDCO to ruin their businesses and subject them to severe hardship in Kebbi. ”Yes we are protesting against Kaduna electricity company , power outage has now become regular even with what the Kebbi State Government is giving them to support supply. “We don’t have light and we don’t have water, our businesses are running down. “We are tired of paying for light we did not consume. We are tired of paying for services we are not getting,” he lamented. Another protesting youth, Ibrahim Abubakar, said they were at Government House to register their complaint against KEDCO. He appealed to the Governor to intervene before people completely lose their patience. He described the attitude of Kaduna Electricity Company as unfortunate and uncalled for despite the millions Kebbi State Government was paying to support constant supply of power to people in the state. When contacted, the Business Development Relation Officer of the company, Dogara Saidu, declined comment, saying he must secure permission from his office to speak. Governor Bagudu had approved the release of N154 million to Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) in April to guarantee uninterrupted power supply to Kebbi State.
