THE Lagos State Government in collaboration with safety experts yesterday clearly explained the causes of fire outbreaks and how to avoid them. The Director General and Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Safety Commission, Dr Lanre Mojola said dry weather is a major cause of fires,  but also identified other causes such as storage of petrol in homes and markets, careless disposal of cigarette stubs, adulterated fuel, power surges, petrol tank explosions, electricity sparks and illegal connection of electrical wires. He said people should note these causes of fires and ensure they are prevented. He spoke during the second Lagos Fire Safety conference organised by the Commission in collaboration with safety experts. The conference with the theme, “Fire safety development plan- A sustainable approach” had speakers from the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Nigeria Insurance Association (NIA), Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Federal Fire Service, Nigeria Emmergency Management Agency (NEMA), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Nigerian Red Cross.
