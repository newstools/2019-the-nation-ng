The Redeemer’s University, Ede in Osun State at the weekend graduated 379 students at its 11th convocation. Speaking at the event held on the university campus in Ede, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo advised youths to face the future with hope, saying they should not to allow the nation’s challenges to overwhelm them. Represented by the acting Chairman, Board of Trustees of the university, Pastor Idowu Iluyomade, the vice-president urged the graduating students to be focused and face challenges. He admonished them not to join the bandwagon of pessimists, “who complain daily about the nation’s challenges rather than face the challenges and succeed in life.” Osinbajo said the world itself is full of distractions “capable of luring those who are not focused away from attaining their goals,” adding that the serious minded ones will take advantage of a lot of opportunities that abound in the country.
