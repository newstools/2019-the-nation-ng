A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Mushin1 Constituency, Nureni Akinsanya, has assured Lagosians that the House will not let them down. Speaking at the Lawmaker’s Constituency Stakeholders meeting, he said the 9th Lagos Assembly would be unrelenting in partnering with the Executive on moving the state forward. According to Akinsanya, a smooth relationship was necessary between the two arms to develop the state. He said that was one of the reasons why the 2019 Constituency of Stakeholders meeting was targeted at a cleaner environment. According to the lawmaker, this was part of the House’s contributions towards ensuring a cleaner, safe and sustainable environment. Akinsanya said one of the focal areas of the Sanwo –Olu administration is a cleaner environment as promised in its campaign promises. Akinsanya pointed that a clean environment is essential in a mega city like Lagos for it to continue to maintain its leadership position in the country. He therefore tasked his constituents in Mushin Local Government to key into the clean environment agenda of the state government.
