Investors showed improved appetite for Nigerian equities in the immediate past week as attractive valuations, reduced political risk and improved macroeconomic direction spurred a broad-based bargain-hunting for quoted shares. Benchmark indices for the Nigerian equities market showed average gain of 2.33 per cent at the weekend, equivalent to net capital gains of N307.7 billion for the week. However, the listing of additional shares by Stanbic IBTC Holdings lifted the total increase in market value of quoted equities to N316 billion at the weekend. The sustained rally coincided with the Wednesday September 11, 2019’s decision of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal affirming the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Total market value of quoted equities rebounded with net gain of N52 billion on Wednesday, rose further by N141 billion on Thursday and capped the rally with a net gain of N172 billion on Friday. Many analysts had said investors might have interpreted the decision of the presidential election tribunal as a sign of stability that gives clearer direction of the macroeconomic direction, notwithstanding the discontent in the opposition camp and possible appeal to the Supreme Court. The rally, the highest in recent weeks, moderated the negative average year-to-date return to -11.62 per cent. On a quarterly basis, average return so far for the third quarter improved, though still negative, to -7.30 per cent. Meanwhile, the benchmark turned positive for August with a month-to-date return of 0.92 per cent.

Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also rallied from its opening value of N13.207 trillion for the week to close weekend at N13.523 trillion. With 39 advancers to 19 decliners, most sectoral indices also closed positive underlining the broad bargain-hunting that drove the overall market performance.

Analysts meanwhile remained cautious about the outlook for the Nigerian equities market, although improved macroeconomic direction is expected to impact the market positively. “Our view continues to favour cautious trading owing to the fact the gains recorded this week were not broad-based. Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive while price deterioration has resulted in expected dividend yields on some stocks rising significantly to levels on par with yields on Treasury bills. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments,” Cordros Securities stated. Most analysts believed the delivery of the presidential election judgement would spur government activities in the period ahead and provide additional impetus for market performance. Managing Director, APT Securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Kasimu Garba Kurfi, said the decision of the presidential election tribunal would provide a clearer direction for the market. “We are expecting positive response, especially in view of the early presentation of the underlying assets for the 2020 national budget,” Kurfi said.
