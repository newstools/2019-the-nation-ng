The Abia State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has paraded two persons arrested for allegedly dealing in illegal petroleum products. The suspects, Osondu Nweke and Ogbonna Uchendu from Anambra and Abia states, were reportedly arrested at Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State by operatives of the anti-vandal unit of the command. NSCDC state Commandant Mr. Nnamdi Nwannukwu, while parading the suspects before reporters, said Osondu was arrested in a Mack truck with 33,000 litres of dark viscous liquid suspected to be a petroleum product. He said Uchendu was also nabbed in an 18-seater bus loaded with two 800-litre GeePee tanks and a 120-litre drum of a similar product. Nwannukwu said the suspects would be arraigned after investigation.
