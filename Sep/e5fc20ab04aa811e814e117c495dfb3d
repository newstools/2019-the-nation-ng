Popular Celestial pastor and founder of Genesis Model Parish of the Celestial Church of Christ, Israel Ogundipe, is trending with the story of how London-based woman of God, acclaimed philanthropist and General Overseer of Love of Christ Church in Clapham, London, Rev. Esther Ajayi, rescued him out of financial crisis. The Cele pastor is said to have confessed that Rev. Ajayi bailed out his ministry when it was facing financial crisis, especially at the beginning when things were tough for him. As such, Genesis, as he is fondly called, is said to have declared that he will forever be grateful to his ‘spiritual mother’, as he now calls Rev.  Ajayi. “Mama Esther Ajayi was the one who gave me a whooping N60million to acquire the land for our permanent site at Idimu part of Lagos State. As I am talking, I am in the United States of America with her touring with her and spreading the Gospel of Christ. This is not the first time. She takes me everywhere with her: UK, Europe, Asia just name it. I have gone places and met so many great and influential people through her; that has helped my destiny”, Genesis is said to have added.
