THE spouse of murdered Navy Commander Oluyemisi Ogundana has relocated to Jaji to ensure thorough a investigation on the matter, The Nation learnt yesterday. Sources said Tunde Ogundana, a lawyer, had not come back since the news of her disappearance reached him. Identified simply as Mr. Ogundana, the man was said to have told family friends he would be in Kaduna State until autopsy was conducted. “We planned to visit the family but were told that her husband was still in Kaduna. He has been there since and said he would not be back until after autopsy. “It is true that they were very close. The woman was a peaceful person. She was the type that would apologise to you even if you were the one that offended her. “She was a Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) member, a strong one at that. She was also telling me to follow her to church,” a family friend told The Nation yesterday. Some of her colleagues told our correspondent they were pained such cruelty was done to her, noting that she did not deserve to be killed like that. “I wished you knew her. She was an amazing soul. I used to wonder why she joined the military because she was too calm and simple. If it was a loud person or someone that was known to be troublesome, maybe, I would not feel so bad. “Yemisi was a good person. She did not deserve such wickedness, not her,” said another source. It was gathered that Mrs. Ogundana who was the Commandant, Command Secondary School at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji was billed to stop by at her Lagos home before proceeding to Sapele where she was redeployed to. The Nigerian military was yet to make any comment on the incident at press time.
