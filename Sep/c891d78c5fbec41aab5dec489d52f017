The Kalasewe of Apoi in Ilaje local government area of Ondo State, Prof. Sunday Amuseghan,  has pleaded with the Federal Government to release the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, from detention. The monarch said Sowore, who is a worthy son of Apoi, should be released unconditionally because his arrest and detention portends grave danger for democracy. The publisher of Sahara Reporters and convener of Global Coalition for Security and Democracy in Nigeria was arrested by the operatives of the Department of State Services over a planned protest tagged: RevolutionaryNow. He was accused of a plot to forcefully change the government. In a statement, the Kalasuwe said the arrest was a violation of Sowore’s fundamental human right, adding that , he did not commit treasonable offence because the protest has not been held. Kalasuwe, who faulted the rationale behind the arrest, said it was unfortunate that Nigerians usually forgot past events. He said Nigeria’s problems emanated from the military’s dictatorship and the tendency to gag the press and prevent freedom of speech and expression. The monarch said the planned protest would have presented to Nigerians and opportunity to express their feelings to President Muhammadu Buhari. Amuseghan said Nigerians were entitled to express their feelings, provided the protest was peaceful and violent-free. He said: “Not everybody can have access to the presidency in Abuja. This is democracy, not militarism, where people are cowed and jailed over issues relating to their welfare. “Sowore is an activist, and he was part of the struggle for this democracy. Therefore, he is entitled to express his feelings and that of Nigerians in a democratic setting”.
