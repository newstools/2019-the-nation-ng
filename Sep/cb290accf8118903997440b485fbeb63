A former staff of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Mr. Micheal Oshodin, has been arrested for duping employment seekers into the University of Benin. Oshodin, aged 59, said he worked and retired at Stores and Supply Department of UBTH. He was paraded at the Edo State Police Command on Friday for duping over 25 persons by collecting huge sums from them with a promise to securing employment for them. Oshodin, however, said he was contacted by a staff of UNIBEN, one Christy Ikeke Oni in the Department of Theatre Art to look for persons seeking to be employed in the institution. He said the problem started when the Christy suddenly died two months ago after he had given her all the money he collected from his victims. According to him, “She died two years ago. That was why this problem came up. The people have been begging me to help them find job and I decided to help them when opportunity came. I gave Christy all the money I collected from them. “I was walking inside UNIBEN when one of the victim saw me and raised alarm. I gave the deceased UNIBEN staff N1.2m. I already told them I will pay them back but I need little time.”
