Apart from her ravishing beauty, Rashida Bello, First Lady of Kogi state, is generous to a fault. The Jattu, Edo State- born’s ideology is: “We rise by lifting others”. This principle has been a guide for her all the years. Those not close to her are of the opinion that her philanthropic works are tied to the fact that she is a First Lady and her husband just won the All Progressive Congress (APC) re-election ticket. But mischief makers and wailers are quick to forget that she is someone who had lived all her life for others to be better. This led to birth of her Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), Rashida Bello Foundation. The NGO is focused on capacity building, skill acquisition, health care support, women and child rights advocacy, moral and ethical support, societal reformation, educational support and career enhancement. Recently, she advocated against forced and early marriage as well as supported a young artiste who drew her portrait on Instagram with N1 million. Out of her magnanimous nature, most especially for the aged ones, she commissioned a newly and tastefully furnished building to an aged woman named, Hauwawu from Eba-Adavi L.G.A of Kogi state. The graduate of Accountant from the University of Abuja was said to have been moved to tears, seeing the dilapidated state of the old woman’s house when she was on a door to door campaign for President Buhari’s re-election campaign.
