The President of Fatima Charity Foundation (FCF) Chief Bintu Fatima Tinubu has distributed exercise books to pupils in three schools. The schools are Lagos Island East Montessori Nursery and Primary School, Lagos Island, Ladipo Primary School, Sari-Iganmu and Ikosi Primary School, Ikosi-Isheri. Chief Tinubu, who is the Iyalode of Lagos, said the gesture was to complement the effort of the state government in education. “We decided that there is a lot to be done by the Lagos State government and they cannot do it alone. We decided to help the children to make their study easier,” she said. The Iyalode of Lagos said the Chairman of Lagos Island East Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Comrade Kamal Salau-Bashua did a great job by building a modern school capable of competing with private schools. Nigeria, she said, will gain more if all school-age children are enrolled in school. She urged the youth to shun cultism and other criminal activities. “Be determined to succeed and work towards achieving that success. You don’t need the government to get yourself to succeed, it’s what you do to yourself – your determination, energy, focus, that will make the world a better place for you,” she said. Comrade Salau-Bashua hailed Chief Tinubu for coming to the aid of the schools. He described private sector partnership with government as perfect, urging other non-governmental organisations to emulate the foundation. “We don’t expect our youths to be on the streets while their peers are in the classrooms. They should seize the opportunity of learning under a condusive atmosphere we are creating and make a good future for themselves,” he said.
