To boost its after-sales support capacity, Panasonic Middle East & Africa Division and Panaserv Nigeria Limited, promoters of the Panasonic brand of electronics, have organised a special training in Lagos and Enugu for its key technical staff members, channel partners and freelance technicians and engineers on air conditioners installation and repairs. The training, which took place this week, was facilitated by delegates and engineers from Panasonic Japan, Malaysia Factory & UAE as major resource persons, in conjunction with the best of the company’s core technical staff members at all Panaserv service centres in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and Enugu. On the reason for the training, one of the two chief trainers from Panasonic, Mr. Premsankar Vijayan, said delivering the skill enhancement for technical partners was an activity ingrained in the culture of the organisation, noting that the company would continue to empower more technicians with requisite skills. Vijayan explained: “These training sessions offer participants the opportunity to update their skills in residential air conditioner installation and the use of ultra-modern tools for accurate diagnoses and repairs of air conditioners. This is why among the equipment being deployed for practical demonstrations here includes the latest models of gas leakage detectors, digital temperature thermometers, and vacuum machines, automated gas refilling machines, portable welding machines, clamp meters and several others.” Vijayan further explained that the training would deepen the pool of well-trained technicians that would not only assist the company in offering after-sale services to its customers but also help to bridge the technical skills gap in Nigeria.
