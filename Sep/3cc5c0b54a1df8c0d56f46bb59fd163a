The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has equipped local steel producers for the global market. It said it is spearheading the harmonisation of standards within Africa and the West African sub-region, urging Nigerian steel producers to not only take advantage of the biggest market in Africa, but also the world over. Its Director-General, Osita Aboloma, at an emergency meeting with steel producers, said the meeting was basically to prepare operators of the organised steel sector on the need to adhere to quality for their goods to be acceptable within Nigeria and at the global market. “If you adhere to standards in Nigeria, your goods will be accepted anywhere in the world because of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), Nigeria has signed. Almost all the African countries that have subscribed to the agreement will use the harmonised standards to achieve seamless trade activities and for breaking technical barriers to trade,” he said. According to him, the steel sector is one of the most formidable sectors where the nation has the competitive and comparative advantage to earn lots of foreign exchange, while also creating wealth and job opportunities. Speaking on the raids the agency embarked on to ensure sanity in the steel sector, he said they were part of its conformity assessment activities to make sure goods are produced to meet global best practices.
