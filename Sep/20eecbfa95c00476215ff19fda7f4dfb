The Senate Committee on Finance is set to invite the Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed and the chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr Babatunde Fowler anytime soon. The Senate committee chairman, Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Lagos West), said the invitation is to enable Ahmed and Fowler shed light on the proposed increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 5 percent to 7.2 percent, as recently announced by the federal government. Adeola, in a statement on Thursday by his media adviser, Kayode Odunaro, said that the proposed increase in VAT has generated mixed reactions among the general populace on its possible effects on living standards and the economy. “We are glad that the Minister of Finance indicated that the VAT Act will have to be amended for the increase to take effect. But we are concerned about the current economic situation of the country as it affects the generality of the people”, the lawmaker stated. Senator Adeola further stated that the interaction with the two key officials of the federal government will form part of the basis for possible amendment to the VAT Act and to assuage any sentiments against the proposed increase if eventually the Act is amended.
