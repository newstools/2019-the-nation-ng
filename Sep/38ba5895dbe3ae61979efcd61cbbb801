Vice-President Professor Yemi Osinbajo will on Friday deliver a keynote address at the 2019 edition of the Presidential Policy Dialogue organised by the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). The event, which will hold at Eko Hotel and Suites on Victoria Island, Lagos, will be chaired by LCCI President Babatunde Runwase. The dialogue was initiated by LCCI to create a platform for the organised private sector and the Federal Government to deliberate on the state of the nation, public policy initiatives of government and their effects on the economy. The forum brings together key government officials and major players in the organised private sector spanning across various sectors of the economy as well as members of the diplomatic corps. It would also explore collaboration possibilities between the private sector and the government. LCCI’s Director General Muda Yusuf said the initiative was in furtherance of its public policy advocacy. “The Chamber believes that through engagements, such as this, the government and the organised private sector can identify and address issues affecting the growth of our economy with a view to proffering long-lasting solutions to them,” he said. Muda added that the way out of the present economic and prevailing social crises for Nigeria was through collaborative engagements.
