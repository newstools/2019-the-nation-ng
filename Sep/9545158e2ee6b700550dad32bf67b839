To mark the global Beer Responsible Day, International Breweries Plc, Ilesha, Osun State, has begun a campaign on the importance of responsible drinking. This is in line with the United Nations Goal 12, which centres on Responsible Consumption and Production. The commemoration was an initiative of IB’s parent company AB InBev. Themed “Drink Smart Today, Celebrate Tomorrow – Let’s Champion Smart Drinking Together”, the celebration encouraged consumers, bar owners and the public to make personal commitments around responsible drinking. Consumers were educated on the dangers of drinking and driving, harmful effect of underage drinking and consumption of alcohol by pregnant women. They were also advised to pace their alcoholic drinks to not more than one drink per hour, eat food before or while drinking alcohol, alternate alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic beverages while drinking. IB Legal and Corporate Affairs Director, Otunba Michael Daramola, said advocating responsible drinking was part of the company’s  objectives. “Responsible drinking is one of the key pillars of our business. It is a message that is dear to us and we constantly make out time to communicate this message in our sphere of influence. The turnout of our employees was great and we visited a lot of bars in many communities where we operate to interact with consumers, traders and the general public on the best way to consume alcohol responsibly,” he said. This year’s theme was inline with efforts by the Beer Sectoral Group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) to reduce underage drinking. The Beer Sectoral Group to which International Breweries belongs has collaborated with the Collingwood Learning Incorporated and Thespian Theatre to launch an underage drinking intervention programme, tagged Smashed.
