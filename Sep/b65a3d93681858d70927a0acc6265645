The Chairman of Itire-Ikate Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Dr Ahmed Apatira yesterday warned members of cult groups to desist from the act or face the wrath of the law. Apatira spoke in the wake of a fracas between members of Aiye and Eiye cult groups at the weekend. 10 suspected members of the groups were arrested. The council boss urged youths in the area to shun any overture from members of cult groups. He said, “My advice to them is to desist from the devilish act, or be arrested. Anyone caught will be prosecuted and eventually jailed. So, instead of wasting your youth life and end up behind bars, why don’t you engage in something meaningful? We will not condone criminal activities in this council.” Apatira urged the youth to take advantage of various vocational training going on in the council. “Our vision is to create something out of nothing by using the power of imagination and creativity. The process of innovation will lead to wealth creation through those acquired skills. Those that have graduated are creating jobs for others. We want our youths to channel their energies to doing something meaningful. This is the time to give their lives proper direction. Whatever skill they learn will be useful to them forever,” he said.
