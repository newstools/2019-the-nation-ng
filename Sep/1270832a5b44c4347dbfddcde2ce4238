Residents of Aboru, Alabede and Ipaja areas of Lagos State have hailed the government for clearing drainage in the areas. They said the monthly cleaning would improve the people’s  living condition and prevent flood during the rainy season. Workers of the company handling the cleaning, Quality Sanctuary Ltd, were seen working on the project on Monday with enthusiasm. Mr. Ade Olojede, who lives at Aboru, said since Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu took over the mantle of leadership, he had resumed the regular cleaning of the drainage, which would make life more comfortable for the residents. He said: “We must commend the government under the leadership of Governor Sanwo-Olu for approving the cleaning and maintenance of our primary channels. The cleaning is a welcome development at this critical period.” Another resident, Samson Okey, a trader, said: “The condition of the canal in the past was terrible. But with the coming of Governor Sanwo-Olu , things have improved, as the Ministry of the Environment has mobilised a contractor to the site and work is progressing. We praise the governor for his thoughtfulness and commitment to his campaign promises.” Mr. Okey hailed the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Lekan Shodehinde, an engineer, for a thorough job. He said: “We must single out for commendation the duo of the permanent secretary of the ministry and the Director, EFAD, Henri Johnson, an engineer, for the wonderful job being done. They have brought their years of experience to bear on the environment. They must be praised by us.” Mr. Femi Oguntade, a resident of Jakande Estate, was also full of praises for the government for clearing the drainage. A social media influencer and journalist, Comrade Edafe Oghenebrume, showered encomiums on the government for a job well done in the area.
