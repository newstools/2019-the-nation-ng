LEICESTER City’s boss Brenda Rodgers has hailed Nigerian midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and his teammates after their hard fought win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Rodgers saw his Leicester City team fight back from a goal down to claim the entire three points at the King Power Stadium, thanks to goals from Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison. With the win, it means that Leicester have suffered just one defeat in their last nine Premier League home games (W6 D2), after losing four in a row directly before that. Reacting to the win, Rodgers rued Ndidi’s disallowed goal, but praised his wards for a good show in the second half. “It was a wonderful performance. I thought the players were outstanding. We started the game with a great tempo, which sets the emotion in the stadium. “It was just a case of preparing the players mentally for the second half. We had to adapt the system at half-time. The players deserve huge credit. The quality we showed was top-class against an outstanding team. “Some of the offside decisions – it’s fine margins. Whatever the decision, you have to adapt and keep your focus on the game. The players did that very well,” he told the media.
