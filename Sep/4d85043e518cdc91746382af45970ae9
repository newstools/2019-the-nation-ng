Vice President Yemi Osinbajo must not be “disgraced out of office” except he has committed serious constitutional infractions, Founder of Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has stated.
Bakare however declared he does not believe the Vice President has done anything to violate his oath of office. He spoke with reporters on Sunday during which he referred to his recent encounter with a UK-based pastor. The pastor, according to him, sent him a message bemoaning the nation’s economic woes. He said: “The pastor expressed the disillusion of a Nigerian whose major concern was not the politics of Abuja but the economics of his/her bank account, especially following the proposed implementation of the federal government’s cashless policy”. Bakare said he reportedly told the pastor: “Every man will care about what bothers him most or bites him hardest. “My concern presently is that come rain, come shine, the VP, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo must not be disgraced and humiliated out of office except he has truly and flagrantly violated his oath of office which I find difficult to believe. “I fear for those who rejoice at the “fall” of others. Those who sow such seed are unmindful of the consequential definite law of harvest. I truly grieve for my brother and pray for God’s goodness, mercy and grace to surround him at this moment. “May the present overwhelming challenges, trials, afflictions and or guilt by association be resolved in such a manner that God’s name will be praised and glorified in him at the end whether or not he remains as VP till the end of this term.”
