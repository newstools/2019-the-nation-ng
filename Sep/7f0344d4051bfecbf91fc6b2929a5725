Residents of Ekpan community, Uvwie council area of Delta state have been thrown into panic, following a clash between Igbo traders and suspected youths of the area over payment of development levy, popularly known as “deve”. The incident reportedly occurred around the Udumoto area of Ekpan along the NNPC Housing Complex road. The Nation learnt that trouble started when the Igbo traders declined to pay the youths a certain sum of money they had demanded from truck drivers who were offloading goods owned by the traders. The Igbo traders who had earlier agreed to pay the illegal fee later refused to pay after the youths increased the fee and turned down the amount offered by the traders. This according to both parties. The traders, it was gathered, challenged the youths, pursuing them with cutlasses and other objects. But the youths had promised a reprisal attack by mobilizing back to the area. Sources stated that the traders had also brought in other members from Warri and Uvwie to the scenario. Although it was not clear how many sustained injuries, witnesses alleged that both parties had their share of wounds during the fracas. However, men of the Nigeria Police have been deployed to the area to prevent further conflict between the groups.
