The board of MTN Nigeria on Thursday rejected xenophobic attacks against Nigerians and other nationals in South Africa. Its Chairman, Ernest Ndukwe, in a statement, said the board also rejected reprisal attacks in Nigeria too. The statement read: “The board of MTN Nigeria wishes to add its unequivocal condemnation of the xenophobia and violence against Nigerians and other nationalities in South Africa over the recent days, as well as the violent response to it in Nigeria. Violence cannot and must never be acceptable and we must reject it in the strongest terms possible. “We offer our profound sympathies to all those affected and urge all stakeholders and communities in Nigeria, South Africa and other countries, to act with restraint, and to work collaboratively to address these issues.” Ndukwe said  the future as a continent will be built on enhanced connections and greater integration economically, culturally and politically. “It is in all of our interests to work together,” Ndukwe said.
