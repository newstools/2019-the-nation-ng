The Taraba State National and State House of Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal, sitting in Abuja has upheld the election of Senator Emmanuel Bwacha representing Taraba South Senatorial District on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). A three-man panel of the tribunal, led by Justice E. I. Oritsejafor, in a unanimous judgment on Saturday, dismissed the petition by Bauka Ishaya Gamgum of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Oritsejafor, in the lead judgment, held that the petitioners failed to prove their claim of over-voting and substantial non-compliance. Earlier, the tribunal upheld the preliminary objection of the 2nd and 3rd. respondents – PDP and Bwacha – on the grounds that the petitioners did not pay the required filing fees as at the point of presenting the petition before the tribunal’s secretary on March 14, 2019.
