Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has restated his administration’s commitment to make quality education accessible. Wike spoke on Monday while inaugurating the reconstructed and remodelled Sea-Bed Model Primary School in Port Harcourt. The school is one of the 253 upgraded and expanded in the last four years. The opening is part of activities to mark Wike’s 100 days in office. Wike promised to uplift the standard of education through critical interventions. He said: “We shall continue to engage in human capital development; and the best way to do that is to fund educational development. “We are awarding contracts for the construction of 69 primary and basic education schools. These projects will be handled by the people who will be empowered while executing the projects. “The government will continue to develop education to securing the state’s future.” The governor reiterated that fees and levies for primary and secondary schools remain abolished saying: “We shall sanction any school administrator or principal who collects … fee. We have provided funding for all schools…”
