PATIENCE Okon-George may be heading for her fourth IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar, but the quartermiler is looking beyond the podium as she is aiming to pick the ticket to Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. Okon-George, whose personal best this year has been 51.6secs but she is aiming to meet the set standard of 51.3second for her eventual qualification for 2020 Olympic Games. She told NationSport from her base in Calabar yesterday that she was ready to rub shoulders with the world best at the iconic and technologically advanced Khalifa International Stadium in Doha. “I am going there to give my best as usual. Although it is not too good that we are not in camp just few days to the competition; unlike other countries that are already in camp in readiness for the championship. I am sure that our performance in Rabat, Morocco would spur us on in Doha. My aim is to pick my Olympic Games ticket. As long as I am aiming for the podium, there is no doubt that my focus will be on meeting the 51.3seconds standard in the 400m for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,” she said.
