Former captain Carles Puyol has rejected Barça’s offer to become the club’s new sporting director. He explained that several personal projects prevent him from dedicating himself exclusively to Barça. “Good afternoon everyone, in recent weeks, different news about my possible incorporation to Barcelona as Sporting Director has been published. “That is why I feel obliged to communicate to the whole family I knew that, after weighing a lot.” “I have decided not to accept the Club offer. It has not been an easy decision, since I have always said that I would like to return to what I consider my home, but several personal projects in which I am immersed” “I would be prevented at this time from giving you the exclusive dedication that the position deserves. “I would like to thank the club for the trust placed in me by offering me this position of so much responsibility.”
