A consultant to the World Bank, Prof. Abel Ogunwale, has urged government to take steps to control the flow of chemical pesticides to save agribusiness from financial losses. Ogunwale said farmers who use pesticides or fertiliser on their crops risk reduced yield or their produce being damaged or destroyed. Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to control pests, they are among the range of measures farmers take to protect their crops. Ogunwale said the use of substandard, fake and counterfeit pesticides has serious implications for farmers, saying such agro-chemicals not only fail to take care of pests, but also inflict damage on crops and the environment. They also result in losses to farmers because of lower yields. Aside from revenue loss, Ogunwale said substandard pesticides have negative consequences for end users as well. According to Ogunwale, fertile lands require special care to ensure high productivity, resistance to pests and diseases, and maintenance of the soil biodiversity. He urged the government to step up efforts to properly regulate the sale and distribution of farming inputs used for soil fertility and pest control.
