Chairman, Ezeagu Local Government Council in Enugu State, Chukwudi Fred Ezinwa has urged Federal Government to partner state and local councils in the development of the nation’s tourism potentials. Ezinnwa who spoke at a strategic stakeholders meeting recently said that local tourism operators should be encouraged to key into such projects in order to harness the benefits accrued to host communities. According to Ezinwa, “we are under-utilising the rich resources which is God-given gift to the nation. He advised that monitoring and supervision should be incorporated into the systemn to achieve proper growth of the sector across states. Hon. Chima Obieze said: “We already have a blue print on how to work and improve heneke lake and waterfall so that the site will become more attractive to tourists. We also have plans to improve on some other tourist’s site in Ezeagu local government area. Hopefully, in the nearest future there will be a whole lot of improvement in terms of tourism development. The host communities are friendly, as they always serve as tourists guide to visitors.” Former Director-General, Centre for Black Arts and African Civilisation (CBAAC), Sir. Ferdinand Anikwe, said that cultural tourism is one of the most viable aspects of tourism in Enugu State that has been exploited. He noted that, unfortunately, past governments were unable to perfect it in terms of revenue generation. “Enugu State remains one of the most potential tourism destinations in Africa.  But tourism destination must have certain background that will make them thrive. In terms of security Enugu has remained one of the safest havens and the best way of demonstrating is to encourage holidaying which is inseparable from tourism,” he added. Anikwe added that there are variants of tourism such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism, tourism based on man-made heritage sites, nature and others.
