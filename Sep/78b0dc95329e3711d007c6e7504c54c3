Senator Dino Melaye has registered his displeasure with results of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship primary in Kogi. He described the results of the contest in which he participated as “totally unacceptable.” The Kogi West Senator took to his Twitter page to express dissatisfaction with the conduct and the outcome of the exercise. He said: “It is ridiculous to declare a final result of PDP Governorship primary election in Kogi State when my votes sorted out yesterday in 8 out of 10 ballot boxes are missing. “Only to declare votes in 2 out of 10 ballot boxes as my votes. Totally unacceptable.” Senator Dino Melaye lost the Governorship election ticket to Engr. Musa Wada, who emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flag bearer for the November 16 governorship election. Musa Wada, a younger brother of the immediate past Governor Idris Wada, who also contested for the ticket, scored 748 votes to clinch the party ticket. Senator Dino Melaye polled 70 votes to emerge fourth.
