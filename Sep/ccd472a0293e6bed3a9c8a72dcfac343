Akwa Ibom Governor Udom Emmanuel has restated his commitment to resolving the lingering issue associated with the United Evangelical Church founded as Qua Iboe Church. Emmanuel also said he would intervene with a section, which would want the church to maintain its old name, Qua Iboe Church. This is coming on the heels of some misunderstanding especially at the 112 Ikot Ekpene Road, Uyo, branch of the church, which is the Local Assembly the Governor regularly worships and is a registered member. Reacting over the weekend to insinuations by some elements who think that as a key member of the local assembly, he may have certain interests, Emmanuel dismissed the insinuations as outright lies and evil propaganda. The Governor, a Deacon, who has been making progress in bringing peace and harmony between the two contending parties, urged agents of blackmail to direct their miss-applied talents elsewhere. “It is very wrong for certain elements to make unfounded allegations concerning my role in the local assembly on Ikot Ekpene,” said the Governor who had, last Thursday held a peace meeting with the two parties. “At a peace meeting I had with the leadership of the church on Thursday September 26, I had outlined the processes and plans for peace to return to the both the local and the national leadership of the church. “The parties were very satisfied with the plans outlined and went back very happy. “Very soon, we hope to see the full restoration of peace and understanding between the two groups. “I think it is sad and unfortunate for some people to exploit the matter and make unfounded allegations.”
