The Osun State governor, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, has advised university managements, other stakeholders to ensure there is no disruption in the academic calendar year. Speaking at the Osun State University 8th Convocation ceremony yesterday in Osogbo, Oyetola, who is the  visitor to the university,  called for the overhauling of the nation’s education sector, particularly the tertiary education. He said the university education system has the capacity to rescue the country from her present socio-economic predicaments. Assuring that his government would continue to support and invest in education and use the sector as a template and bedrock to impact on the lives of the people and advance the economy of the state, he said that the state government has so far demonstrated its commitment to rebuilding and repositioning education in the state. The governor, who harped on merit in the award of academic excellence and accolade, admonished the rank and file in the education sector on the need for them to pursue the lofty ideals of education that emphasise learning and character. His words: “As you are all aware, the certificates that you will receive from this university are awarded to you on the basis of character and learning. In the order of importance, character comes before learning. It is character that opened the door to knowledge and kept it open until you completed your courses and earned a degree.” Congratulating the graduates, the governor tasked them to pursue things that could help to effect change and bring about positive impacts on the nation’s economy.  He said: “I congratulate the graduands here today for the successful completion of their programmes and graduation.”
