As part of commitment to tackle the issue of underdevelopment bedeviling the Northern region, Chairman of Northern States Governorsâ€™ Forum and Governor of Platueau State, Simon Lalong has commissioned N793 Mall in Kaduna. The mall was built by northern conglomerate, the New Nigerian Development Company (NNDC). Commissioning the three-storey mall on Muhammadu Buhari Way, Lalong, accompanied by other northern Governors, expressed optimism that such investments would better the lives of the people. He however commended the Board and Management of the company for the initiative. Chairman Board of NNDC, Tanimu Yakubu, said the company which was initially known as the Northern Regional Production and Development Board, (NRPDB) was established in 1949 to spearhead the economic and social development of the then Northern region. He disclosed that the decision to develop the ultra -modern shopping Mall; a three-story edifice with state-of-the-art facilities, was part of a 5-Year Strategic Plan of the company and was solely financed 100 per cent at the total cost of N793m by the NNDC.
