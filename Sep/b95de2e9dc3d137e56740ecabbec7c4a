A former Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), Prof Abiodun Adeloye, has warned that African Swine Fever (ASF) and other  trans- boundary animal diseases (TADs) pose health risks. He urged the government to be vigilant in the inspection of cross border trade of animal products. Pests and animal diseases cause yearly loss of more than 40 per cent in the global food supply, causing an impact in the agricultural sector, compromising seriously food security, according to intechopen.com. With herdsmen travelling with cattle across the country, Adeloye said  diseases could move through animals and cause  economic harm. Adeloye called for an end to illegal  movement of animals into the country following the closure of the nation’s borders  as the  impact goes far beyond animal health and welfare, as it causes severe production and economic losses and threatens food security.
