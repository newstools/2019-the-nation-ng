The Police Service Commission (PSC) has said it will meet this week to decide on the recruitment of 10,000 Nigerians into the Constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). The process, which has reportedly reached the final stage, was suspended last week in a statement by the commission. In another statement on Sunday in Abuja, the PSC spokesman Ikechukwu Ani assured applicants that the recruitment will be concluded soon. The statement added that the names of successful candidates would be released. It also stated that the dates for medical screening for successful candidates from the aptitude test held on August 3 would be announced after the meeting this week. Ani said: “Applicants are advised not to panic or be agitated as the exercise is under control and in progress. The commission wishes to state that the recruitment is on course and has not been abandoned.” The commission also said it will continue to carry the NPF and other stakeholders in the Police sector along in the recruitment process to ensure that the exercise retains its merit, transparency and goes according to the laws, rules and regulations guiding the public service.
