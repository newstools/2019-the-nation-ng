Lagos State government   is to boost the entertainment industry by creating a one-stop shop for film makers in the state. It said as part of its effort to boost the film and entertainment industry, film makers would also enjoy support from conceptualisation of ideas to the final production. The Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs. Shuli Adebolu, gave the assurance at the graduation of the pioneer MultiChoice Talent Factory Scholars drawn from across West Africa, held at the Lagos Business School, Ajah, at the weekend. Mrs. Adebolu explained that the state was blessed with beautiful locations for film production and efforts were on to ensure the state has a one-stop centre that would ensure quality and timely  production of films that meet domestic and international standards, which would grow the industry and also attract foreign investors. She reiterated the commitment of the administration to the tourism and entertainment sector by ensuring that the state becomes a preferred destination for tourists and an entertainment hub on the continent. Mrs. Adebolu said: “Lagos is the second largest in the amount of films produced on the continent globally. The state is, therefore, set to open her doors by creating an enabling environment, regulations and solid foundations that would make the sector a flourishing one that could successfully rival the likes of Hollywood and Bollywood entertainment industries.” Commending MultiChoice for its Talent Factory initiative, she restated the readiness of Lagos State government to collaborate with the private sector and key stakeholders for the development of the industry to create jobs and make it a source of revenue for the state.
