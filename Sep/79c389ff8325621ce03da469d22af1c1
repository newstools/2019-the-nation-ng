Lagos State Government has condemned Tuesday’s attacks on Shoprite outlets in Lekki by some unidentified persons. It said the attacks purportedly in retaliation of the xenophobic incidents against Nigerians in South Africa were needless since the Federal government was already in talks with South African authorities to address the situations. In a statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, the government said the attacks were “against the Nigerian spirit of accommodation and benevolence that the country in general and Lagos State in particular is noted for”. The statement explained: “The Federal Government is in dialogue with South African Authorities to stop this obnoxious act. “We appeal to our compatriots to eschew violence and any unlawful acts. “The Lagos State Government wishes to reiterate its commitment to providing a conducive atmosphere where businesses are conducted without hindrances. “The security agencies have been directed to ensure that law and order prevail in all parts of the State, even as Lagosians are advised to go about their activities without any fear.”
