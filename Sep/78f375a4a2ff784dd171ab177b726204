UNILEVER edged Nestle to emerge the 2019 trophy holders in the grand finale of the Remita Corporate Champions Cup (RC3). The match played at the Yaba College of Technology (Yabatech) on Sunday night, had a near-capacity crowd and was as tactical as it was exciting. It took seven penalty kicks before Unilever could put out the dream of former champions, Friesland Campina to lift the new Koenig Trophy for the first time after a goalless draw in regulation time. Unilever defeated FrieslandCampina and IHS Towers en route the final, while Nestle beat First City Monument Bank (FCMB) and Union Bank to make the final of the RC3. The event was graced by dignitaries and senior executives, including the Managing Director of SystenSpecs, John Obaro; Managing Director of Wema Bank, Ademola Adebise; Executive Director of SystenSpecs, Deremi Atanda; former Super Eagles’ goalkeeper and tournament ambassador, Peter Rufai; Chief Operating Officer of Media Vision Limited, Jimmy Shogbesan, Ola Ehinmoro, HR Director, Ghana & Nigeria, Unilever; Sola Akinsoye, Country HR Manager, Nestle and an array of Ex-Super Eagles and Falcons Internationals. Reacting to the quality of football on display throughout the course of the competition and the commitment of his organisation to promoting worthy CSR causes around the nation, John Obaro said: “We are committed to the promotion of a productive workforce capable of accelerating advancement in Nigerian, African and global economies as a whole. “Through RC3, for five seasons we have reinforced our commitment to provide a fun-filled platform for workforce across various brands in diverse industries in Nigeria to relax and bond in a way that ensures work-life balance, without official duties coming in the way”
