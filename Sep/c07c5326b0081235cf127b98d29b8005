Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has assured the people of the state of more people oriented programmes following the Election Petitions Tribunal dismissal of the case against his election. In a statement made available to News Agency of Nigeria in Lafia on Tuesday, Sule said “the time has come for us to come together and move our dear state forward”. “The task to lift Nasarawa State to the next level is a task for all sons and daughters of Nasarawa State and all men of goodwill. “In the last two days, the overwhelming victory that the people of Nasarawa State gave me at the March 9 gubernatorial election was again reaffirmed by the Election Petitions Tribunal. “Let me use this opportunity to thank the Almighty Allah who saw us through the campaigns, the elections and the victory without loss of lives. “It is because God’s holy presence and guidance has never departed and will never depart Nasarawa State that all the 10 aspirants who contested with me on the platform of the APC still stood by me through the campaigns and our victory at the polls. “Today I pay homage to my family, our great party, the APC and honour the eminently qualified citizens who contested with me in the APC. Without your support, it would have been more difficult to win the elections in the very first place. “To you, my dear and great people of Nasarawa State, I say thank you for the love, faith, belief and trust you have shown in me. “To my fellow brothers and sisters on the opposite end of the political divide, I am extending my hand of fellowship once more to you to join us in building of a Nasarawa State.” The governor called for all stakeholders to put all differences aside and join in making the state the pride of local and foreign investors.
