Regarded as one of the oldest monarch in Nigeria, The Olubadan of Ibadanland, HRH Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso 1, is still standing tall and waxing strong as he celebrated his 91st birthday on the 26th of August, amidst pomp. During the birthday celebration, the nonagenarian received a huge surprise. A close source present at the low key birthday celebration said: ” We were seated at the palace in celebration mood, when we received the 21 controversial kings earlier elevated to kingship by the former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi. “The unexpected visitors, arrived the palace in unison, and wowed everyone in the palace, when they all went flat down on the ground in front of Olubadan in utmost obeisance and recognition of his paramount ruler-ship of the ancient city. The homage was paid at Popo Yemoja, Ibadan palace without their beaded crowns especially on such an auspicious occasion.” It was gathered that the estranged High Chiefs had vowed to retain their beaded crowns as kings, claiming that their promotion from High chiefs to beaded crown-wearing Obas was backed by relevant and extant laws The Olubadan, on his part, vehemently insisted that they must be stripped of their crowns, before they can be recognized again as members of the revered Olubadan Advisory Council. The surprise visitation of the High Chiefs to the monarch was a clear indication that the High Chiefs has finally bowed to the wishes of the Olubadan.
