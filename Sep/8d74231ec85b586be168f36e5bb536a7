She spoke during her maiden meeting with management and staff. She said the pensioners, who have served the country, deserved to be treated with dignity. She urged the management and staff of the directorate to ensure that pensioners received their entitlements promptly. She commended them for their hard work and dedication during the last Parastatals Pensioners Verification in the Southeast. She assured the workers that she would be guided by the core values of passion, transparency, and accountability. She said her mission is to build on the legacy left by her predecessor. She welcomed new staff members and urged them to  learn  pension administration and  policies guiding PTAD’s operations. Ejikeme assured them of her commitment to staff welfare and urged them to continue to be punctual to work. She said: “There are proper staff placements and promotions. It is going to be a continuous thing and we will make sure that hard work is rewarded at every level. “PTAD as a highly technology driven, first class organisation must continue to remain topnotch. I seek your support, loyalty, dedication, passion, innovation and big bright ideas that will take the Directorate further on the next level with regards pension administration.” She commended the Federal Government’s reforms in the pension industry, noting that the CPS would ensure that pension settlements were guaranteed.
