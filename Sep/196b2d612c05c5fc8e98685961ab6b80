No fewer than 28 members of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shiites have been arrested in Bauchi after a violent procession in the early hours of Tuesday. In a video obtained by The Nation, several Shiites members were seen around the central market in Bauchi, near the Emir of Bauchi Palace chanting as they carry on with their procession defying police orders. The procession was said to have occurred about 10am on Tuesday at the Central Market roundabout and Tashan Babiye area of Bauchi, the state capital. The Police Public Relation Officer, PPRO, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Abubakar Datti Kamal, confirmed arrest of the 28 Shiites. He disclosed to the Nation at the Police Headquarters in Bauchi that minimum force was applied in the arrest of the El-zakzaky loyalists. Abubakar said the Shiites embarked on a procession despite warnings from the police command not to. He said that traditional rulers in the state serve as intermediaries with the Shiites members to stop the planned procession but to no avail. But the PPRO could not confirm the number of victims injured in the clash. There was tension in the state as the Police clashed with the members of the group. Teargas was reportedly fired to disperse the protesters causing people to scamper to safety.
