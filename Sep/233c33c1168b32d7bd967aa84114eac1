The Chairman of the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) Chief Elias Mbam has confirmed that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has contributed 59.7 percent, representing more than half of revenues to the Federation Account in the last three months. A statement from the FIRS said Mbam spoke on Thursday when he led a delegation of Commissioners on a visit to FIRS Headquarters. According to Mbam: “The FIRS has been the major contributor to the federation account. The average contribution from the FIRS in the last three months is about 59.7 percent. “In other words, more than half of the revenue shared to the three tiers of government comes from the FIRS.” Mbam said they were at the FIRS “to familiarise ourselves with your activities, to know areas of collaboration, your challenges, which we will also help to pass to the Federal Government. “We are all working for the same government and our work is collaborative,” he added. The Executive Chairman of FIRS, Tunde Fowler noted that FIRS would continue do its best to generate revenue to fund the three tiers of government. “We have always told ourselves that the job we do is for the love of the country. We will continue to deliver quality services in tax administration in Nigeria.” He reiterated that the FIRS will keep “deploying technologies to make it easy for taxpayers to pay their taxes conveniently, even from the comfort of their homes or offices, download tax receipts and do other transaction with FIRS without visiting the tax office. “We know the need for increased revenues to the government and we will continue do our best to fund the three tiers of government,” Fowler said.
