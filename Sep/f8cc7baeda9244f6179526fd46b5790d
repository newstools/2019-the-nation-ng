A Biotechnology company, BioMérieux, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to help improve Nigeria’s public healthcare system. The NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, signed on behalf of the Federal Government while BioMérieux’s Vice President, Africa Cluster, Mr. Sinde Chekete, signed on behalf of the company at a ceremony in Abuja. Chekete said the collaboration with NCDC would focus on diagnosing bacteria and recommending the proper anti-biotics for treatment of patients. It would also help to improve the use of anti-biotics in the country. “The MoU is about improving public health and tackling the particular issue we have with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is a public health issue today because we are seeing more and more pathogens and bacteria in particular being resistant to most of the anti-biotics that we have in Africa in general and in Nigeria in particular. “The issue we have with this problem is that anti-biotics as everybody knows has been the most beautiful innovation in healthcare for quite some time. Today, we are being less effective in terms of the use of those anti-biotics, especially the first tier anti-biotics and the fact that some of them are being resistant lead us to use the second generation for common bacteria which are obviously more expensive. “The purpose of this MoU is to collaborate with NCDC and BioMerieux where we have the expertise and knowledge and the solutions to make sure that we identify properly the bacteria and we propose to labs and physicians the adequate anti-biotic treatments adapted to this resistance level in order to reduce the level of resistance and also to improve the use of anti-biotics,” Chekete said.
