Last week, the 2019 African Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) nomination list was released and a particular film, The Delivery Boy scooped 12 nominations across directing, acting and production categories. The film on the backstory of terrorism was written and directed by Adekunle ‘Nodash’ Adejuyigbe and produced by Something Unusual Studios. Adejuyigbe, the face behind the film, is a multiple award-winning filmmaker with years of experience producing TV Commercials, Feature Films, Documentaries and TV shows. He worked  for a TV network as Producer, Writer and Director of TV shows and Documentaries, later became the Creative Director and Head of Production of the TV network before he left to start his film production company- Something Unusual Studios. Adejuyigbe has made a mark in the Nigerian film industry; he has worked with reputable brands across Africa. In 2015, the Berlin Film Festival selected him as one of the 21 Cinematographers from around the world to look out for. His film, ‘The Delivery Boy’, which has screened in four continents to brilliant reviews at various national and international film festivals, won the best Nigerian Film Award at Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF) 2018 and more recently scooped 12 nominations at AMAA. Nodash who is the MD/CEO of Something Unusual Studios is also the Team Lead of ‘The Elite Film Team’ (TEFT). TEFT is recognised as a production powerhouse and its members have participated in there is hardly any major film shot in Nigeria without a TEFT member on it and it seem to have become a pattern that when Nodash and The Elite Film Team are on a project the project will most likely win awards. Little wonder ‘Delivery Boy’ was nominated at AMAA in categories like Directing, Production Design, Soundtrack, Visual Effects, Cinematography, Editing and a host of others.
