Two newly renovated public schools were at the weekend inaugurated in the Agboyi-Ketu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State. The two schools, Irepodun Primary School and Alapere Primary School, had 14 new blocks of class rooms, well-equipped computer rooms, lavatories, kee klamps for food vendors and water points a s well as the installation of interlocking pavers. Speaking at the official inauguration of the projects, the Commissioner for Local Government and Community affairs, Hon. Yetunde Arobieke, said that the project would improve the quality of education in the schools and put smiles in the faces of the students and teachers as well as parents. She lauded the LCDA Chairman, Mayor Dele Oshinowo, for the projects, describing them as legacies to be remembered and which would also speak volumes about him long after his tenure in office. Mayor Oshinowo, in his address on the occasion, said the gesture was in fulfillment of his administration’s commitment to promoting the well-being of children through the provision of quality and affordable education. He said it was part of some of the legacy projects initiated by his administration, which had become its trademark in laying a sustainable foundation for the development of the LCDA. The LCDA chairman said: “Our administration is committed to using the tax payers’ money of this LCDA to better the lives of the citizenry. This gesture is a pointer to the use of education as a tool for development in the society. “We cannot afford to see our leaders of tomorrow acquiring knowledge in overcrowded and stressful classes.” He noted that a lot of projects had been executed by the LCDA while more were ongoing. Oshinowo said that his administration remained open to both public and private partnerships, adding that such support would enable the LCDA to do more.
