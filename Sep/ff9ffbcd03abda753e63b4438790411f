The pioneer Director-General (DG), National Pension Commission (PenCom), Mohammad Ahmed, has called on operators to come up with financial products that will meet the needs of Nigerians in the informal sector. Ahmed, who spoke at the National Association of Insurance and Pension Correspondents’ (NAIPCO) Fourth National Conference in Lagos, expressed concern that notwithstanding the existence of the Micro Insurance and Pension Scheme,  majority of Nigerians who are in the informal sector, a critical segment in the country do not have access to financial services. He, therefore, urged that operators must understand the dynamics of the informal sector, saying they must be creative, innovative and proactive to penetrate the informal sector. He said regulators must come up with light schemes, saying:  “You must understand the business and ensure that information is made available to the operators and consumers as well.’’ He added: “We don’t just issue regulations, we should issue them to protect and promote the business. We are there to support the industry with regulations that can make the sector grow. If there is no business, there is nothing to regulate, thus regulations should be supportive.”
