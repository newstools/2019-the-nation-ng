A Non-Governmental Organisation, Global Society for Anti-Corruption (GSAC) has appealed to Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha to consider  granting amnesty to one Paul Egboluche who is on death row in Enugu Maximum Correctional facility. All convicted persons in the Southeast are taken to Enugu to serve their sentences. The South East/South-South Regional Director of the organisation, Mrs Amaka Nweke said Egboluche has been on death sentence since January 27, 2014 when he was convicted. Nweke said Egboluche, a native of Akokwa in Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State was convicted alongside his father, Celestine Egboluche. “Through our intervention, former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha granted state pardon to the senior Egboluche who at the time was the oldest prison inmate in Nigeria,” she said. She said the senior was 100 years of age at the time of his amnesty. Nweke said Egboluche is the only surviving child of his father. “The long incarceration of the centenarian worsened his health condition due to lack of proper care. Currently, the sick old man is in admission in an Enugu-based hospital. We believe that his release will facilitate the psychological recovery and healing of his sick father,” she said.
