The family, students and staff of an Ondo-based private secondary school have petitioned the police and Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) on the death of the school’s founder, Mrs. Comfort Onobhume, at a private hospital in Ibadan, Oyo State capital. The circumstances surrounding her death were currently generating controversies. Already, the medical director and staff of the private hospital have been accused of negligence, resulting in the death of  the 60-year-old Onobhume on August 13, when the medical team reportedly carried out operations on her. The school’s founder was said to have had infertility issues before she met Dr  O. Fakunle, who managed her pregnancy from gestation to delivery stage. Two separate petitions by her family, students and college staff, dated September 16, were submitted to the Inspector General of Police (lGP), Mohammed Adamu, and the Registrar of MDCN, Dr Fakunle and other medical staff of the hospital.
