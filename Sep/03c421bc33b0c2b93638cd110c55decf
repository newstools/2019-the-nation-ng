Elonu, who led her national team to their 2019 FIBA Afrobasket for Women in Senegal, nailed 23 points to help the club also known as Uni Girona Club de Basquet start 2019/20 season with a trophy, the second DIA League Super Cup in its history. “I am very happy and happy. It has been a tough game. I feel very grateful to be able to start the season winning a title at home,” the power forward said. Coach of the Catalan team, Eric Surís commended the players and fans for standing behind the team to ensure they begin the season with a trophy. “With the pavilion full, everything is easier. We are very happy and satisfied. We have made a good preseason. We are very happy to lift this Super Cup and start with a title. But this has only just begun. We were just at the end, but we have managed to manage the last minutes. In the end anyone could win. The Avenue, as always, has fought the 40 minutes,” he said.
Spar Citylift Girona grabbed a 20-12 comfortable lead early in the game but Avenida replied with a massive 27-19 surge. In the third quarter Girona once again pulled the lead back with a 24-19 run and managed to keep the victory.
