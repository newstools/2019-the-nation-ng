The National Youth Service Corps has pledged to increase the monthly allowance of corps members once the Federal Government starts the payment of the new minimum wage. The NYSC Director-General, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim said this during a visit to the Lagos State orientation camp in Iyana-Ipaja. In a statement by the NYSC’s Director, Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, the DG said the scheme was making efforts to ensure adequate welfare for all corps members. He admonished them not embark on unauthorised journey that could endanger their lives. The NYSC chief explained that embarking in an unauthorised journey was capable of earning the corps members sanction from the scheme. He also vowed to deal with violators of the NYSC bye-laws in line with scheme’s rules. “Don’t debase yourselves, study the bye-law including NYSC Act and be law-abiding. Don’t participate in politics, avoid religious and tribal differences,” he said. Ibrahim also admonished the corps members to imbibe good morals and serve as responsible role models in their host communities. He warned them to avoid rumour peddling through the social media but rather serve as agents of change and national unity.
