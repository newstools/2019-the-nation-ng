The lyrics by late reggae legend Bob Marley that “when the rain falls, it doesn’t fall on one man’s house top” best described current development as the xenophobic attack in South Africa is on verge of truncating a friendly match between South Africa and Zambia. The match fixed for Saturday which should have served as the first in charge for new Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is on the verge of being cancelled as there are pressures on Zambia to jettison the arrangement since the attacks also extended to Gauteng which has high concentration of other Africans including Zambians. Although many reports indicate that Nigerians are mostly targeted but some other reports insist that it is not just Nigerians but also other African countries. South Africa based News24 reported that protesters and looters have targeted foreigners in different parts of Gauteng over the past few days. Zambia football Association is reportedly under intense pressure to call off the match billed for Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka Bafana Bafana Coach Molefi Ntseki and his squad are currently camping in Johannesburg and were scheduled to depart for Zambia on Thursday even as local media are said to be monitoring reaction from both SAFA and ZAFA ahead of scheduled Thursday’s departure of Bafana Bafana for Lusaka. Some other reports indicate that a number of African countries are not happy with the reported attacks in the Rainbow Nation and may not be eager to play should the match against Zambia fail prompting the need for a replacement team to face Bafana Bafana who made it to the quarterfinals of the last Nations cup before bowing out after losing 2-1 to Super Eagles of Nigeria at the Cairo Stadium. Samuel Chukwueze had shot Eagles into the lead in the 27th minute of the encounter but Zungu equalised for Bafana Bafana in the 71st minute but it was Troost Ekong’s 89th minute goal that finally put the match out of the reach of the South Africans who interestingly sent hosts packing in the round of 16 thanks to a lone goal by Thembinkosi Lorch in the 86th minute.
