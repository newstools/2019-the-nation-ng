A FORMER chairman of the Bayelsa State Butchers Association (BSBA) Mr. Chibuzor Nwachukwu has been killed in cold blood in Yenagoa, the state capital. His killers, suspected to be cultists, were said to have shot him in the head, killing him instantly. It was learnt that the assassins laid ambush for Nwachukwu in front of his residence on Ogilo Street, an area notorious for cult activities in the state. He was reportedly returning home from the Swali Market at about 8pm on Tuesday when he ran into his killers. The 42-year-old Nwachukwu, hailed from Nkanu community in Enugu State and was married with four children. A source, who spoke in confidence, said it was a case of assassination, adding that the killers escaped with their victim’s shirt and his android phone. He said, “He was already at the door of his apartment when some boys, who were hiding in the area shot him. They aimed at his head. He was killed in an execution-like style, raising suspicion that it wasn’t a robbery attack. “We don’t know the motive behind the killing. He was a former chairman of the butchers association and he left the office after some controversies. It has been long he left his office. So, we won’t say it was the dispute that led to his killing”. The Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident and said policemen visited the crime as part of ongoing investigations to unmask the identities of his killers. Butswat said: “On 25 September 2019, at about 20:00 hours, unknown gunmen shot and killed one Chibuzor Nwachukwu ‘m’ 42 years, at Ogilo Street, Yenagoa.”
