The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, has endorsed the administration of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki. He urged the governor to remain focused on his quest for sustainable development in the state. The monarch, who spoke when he visited the Government House in Benin, said the governor deserved support to continue in his transformative work. He said: “I am here to associate myself with you for all the good you are doing, and to let you know that we are watching. You have combined your experiences from the private sector with the public sector to take the state to greater heights. You are one of the greatest financial engineers the country has produced as your success is there for all to see in the private sector. “I am sure you are applying the same principles in the public sector because the people need you to put up a good legacy that posterity will always remember you for…” Obaseki thanked the Ooni and his entourage for the visit, saying the ruler remained one of the nation’s progressive traditional leaders. According to him, there was a symbiotic relationship between the political and traditional institutions. Governor Obaseki thanked the monarch for his role in peacekeeping, saying: “You have been a bridge-builder and transverse the length and breadth of this country, getting people to believe in this country.” Earlier, Obaseki and the Ooni joined other dignitaries to celebrate the Esama of Benin, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion’s 85th birthday.
