Following incessant cult clashes in Ekete and Ovwian communities of Udu council area of Delta state, a dusk-to-dawn curfew has been imposed on the flash points by the council chairman, Mr. Jite Brown. In a statement signed by the council secretary, Elohor Awinoron, the curfew which took effect from Wednesday, lasts from 9pm to 6am. According to the statement, the decision was reached after deliberations with Divisional Police Officers and other security chiefs in the council. Suspected rival cult groups have recently turned some areas in the communities to hideouts for their criminal operations.
Residents have been living in fear due to the killings, robberies and other assaults meted on victims.
Areas affected by the curfew are Ovwian town, Ekete Inland, Ekete Waterside, Owhase town, Express, Mofor and Orhuwhorun Junctions. The council chairman stated that the movement of commercial vehicles, including tricycles and motorbikes, commonly referred to as Keke NAPEP and Okada, are also restricted. He said anyone found operating within the time of curfew will be impounded and the owner prosecuted. Brown further emphasized that security men have been put on red alert to enforce the curfew, urging people in the respective areas to adhere to the directive.
