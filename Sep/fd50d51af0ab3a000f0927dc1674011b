Wilfred Ndidi produced a Man-of-the-Match performance yesterday  as Leicester City produced a clinical performance to trash 10-man Newcastle 5-0 at the King Power Stadium. The win puts Leicester in the third position with 14 points, two points behind Man City who sits in second place and seven points behind leaders, Liverpool who they face on Saturday. The Nigeria international hit the scoresheet with the fifth goal in the final minute of the game, converting from Ben Chilwell’s cross. It was Ndidi’s second goal of the season having already scored in the Foxes 1-1 draw against Chelsea earlier this season. Earlier goals from Ricardo Pereira followed by a brace by  Jamie Vardy as well as the own goal by  Paul Dummett  helped Leicester to its biggest ever Premier League win. Meanwhile, other Nigeria Internationals in action yesterday  included William Troost-Ekong who played the entire match but  got a yellow card in  Udinese’s  1-0 win over Bologna. Anthony Nwakaeme and John Mikel Obi started for Trabzonspor with the former Super Eagles captain getting a yellow card  while  Nwakaeme scoring the last goal in the 4-1 thrashing of Besiktas. In Greece, Super Eagles prospect Chuba Akpom started from the bench in PAOK Thessaloniki FC 2-2 clash with AEK Athens. Anderson Esiti was on the bench and didn’t play any part.
