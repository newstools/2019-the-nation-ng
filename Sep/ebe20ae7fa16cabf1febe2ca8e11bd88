Record label executive Yusuf Abdou Ramy, also known as Doro Bom, has unveiled his strategy to take music talents to the next level under Doro Musik Gang. As part of it’s plans, the label has signed ex-YBNL artiste, Opeyemi Babatunde Rahim, popularly known as Lyta. The singer had made a passionate cry for help after falling out with his ex-record label. Clearing the air on the singer’s new deal, Ramy said they saw an opportunity in the singer. “Lyta was already making waves before he got signed to the label. Of course, he does not have any contract binding him to anybody or any label; and we at the label saw an opportunity to sign a young and futuristic act with the mindset of progressing in the industry,” he said. Speaking more about his antecedents and his record label, the showbiz executive, who was born to a Nigerian mother and Cameroonian father, expressed commitment to connecting African talents to the world. He said: “I schooled partly in Nigeria and Cameroon before completing a degree in Business at the University of Buea in 2010. With Doro Musik Gang, I want to capitalise on the growing entertainment market across Africa through the production and promotion of high-quality entertainment. We are a multimedia entertainment company which will supply profitable, positive, audio and visual entertainment to a diverse, international consumer group. Doro Musik Gang is committed to wholesome entertainment across board, and firmly believes that quality, entertainment can be realised without compromising commercial appeal.” Doro Musik Gang launched out in August 2018 with songs from its act, Bobby Jazx, such as Kowope, Key and Show Dem featuring Zlatan, among others. The label has helped Lyta to release the hit song, Monalisa with a remix featuring Davido.
