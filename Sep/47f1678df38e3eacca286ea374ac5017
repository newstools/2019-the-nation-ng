The Assistant Controller General (ACG), Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), Mr. Tunde Ladipo, has said prisons have become reformative, rehabilitative and correctional centres to inmates. He spoke at the weekend at a send-off organised for him by officers and workers of the NCS at the state headquarters in Alagbon, Ikoyi, Lagos. Ladipo said many inmates had become self-reliant and better citizens in the society after serving their jail terms. The NCS boss hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for the change he had brought to the correctional services, saying it would be in line with international standard, which means inmates will not only come to prison to be punished, but also to be educated and trained in skills so that they will be useful and not be a burden on the society. “Efforts are being made by the NCS to train inmates in vocational skills so that they will become better persons and be self-reliant in the society. “Some of them are allowed to write external exams to gain admission to tertiary institutions,” Ladipo said. He said during his tenure, there was infrastructural development at prisons and the state headquarters, adding that he built a synergy between sister agencies, non governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Lagos State Government. Ladipo is now the ACG Supply at the national headquarters in Abuja.
