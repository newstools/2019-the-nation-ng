Two Nigerian firms, GatesAir Limited and Pinnacle Communications have signed an agreement to continue the expansion of digital TV build-out in the West African nations, which is expected to reach more than 50 million homes and 170 million residents. Addressing journalists at the weekend during Pinnacle Communications’ delegate inspection of the GatesAir’s Quincy’s manufacturing facility, the CEO of GatesAir Limited, Bruce Swail, said half of the products GatesAir produces are for international customers. He emphasized that broadcasting technology created and built in Quincy has a huge transformative impact across the globe, which has also received accolades from many users. According to Swail, GatesAir has over the years produced wireless and over-the-air content delivery solutions for radio and TV broadcasters, saying his firm and Pinnacle Communications agreement will facilitate the expansion of new digital TV services and the Digital Switch-Over initiative. Also speaking at the inspection tour, the chairman and CEO of Pinnacle Communications, Sir Lucky Omoluwa, traced the relationship between the two firms to 1998, when TV and FM radio stations were launched across Nigeria. He said GatesAir has made quality its watchword, saying no site settings carried out on all the transmitters delivered to them at the time, by the GatesAirs and all worked perfectly. Also lending his voice to the development, the Managing Director of GatesAir for Europe, Middle East and Africa Region, Andy McClelland, assured the delegation that the business pact existing between his firm and Pinnacle Communications will continue for many years to come. According to McClelland,  state-of-the-art digital and terrestrial television platforms being rolled out in the heart of Africa can also curry envy even from European countries. Quincy Mayor Kyle Moore, while responding, told the group that he was proud to see GateAir’s partnerships around the globe. Moore said with 97 years history of GatesAir operation in the world, the firm has the ability to deliver on very large programmes with utmost integrity.
