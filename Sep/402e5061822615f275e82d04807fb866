The International Associations of Athletics Federation (IAAF) has put together N2.6billion ($ 7,530,000) as prize money for the 2019 World Athletics Championships holding in Doha, Qatar from September 27 to October 6. In a statement issued by IAAF and made available to NationSport, athletes from Nigeria and other participating countries will be aiming to share from the purse, while athletes who set new records in individual events will get N35 million (US$100,000) offered by TDK and Qatar National Bank (QNB). TDK’s involvement with the IAAF World Championships goes beyond the world record programme, as the Japanese electronics company has been the main bib sponsor for men’s events for all 16 previous editions and will maintain that involvement in Doha. QNB, which joined the IAAF as partner last year, will offer the same generous sponsorship package for women’s events at the IAAF World Championships. Prize money for individual events are Gold- US$ 60,000; Silver- US$ 30,000; Bronze- US$ 20,000; fourth place- US$ 15,000; fifth place- US$ 10,000; sixth place- US$ 6000; seventh place- US$ 5000 and eighth place- US$ 4000. In relays (per team): Gold- US$ 80,000; Silver- US$ 40,000; Bronze- US$ 20,000; fourth place- US$ 16,000; fifth place- US$ 12,000; sixth place- US$ 8000; seventh place- US$ 6000 and eighth place- US$ 4000.
