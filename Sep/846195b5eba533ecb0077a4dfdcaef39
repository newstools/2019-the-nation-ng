The 123 indigenes of Jigawa State arrested last Friday in a truck in Agege with 48 motorcycles by the state Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Task Force), were on Saturday released by the Lagos State Police Command. They were handed over to the police for profiling after arrest, but spokesman Bala Ikhana said after profiling of the men, nothing incriminating was found on them and they were released. He said the suspicion and subsequent interception of the truck arose from the manner they came in, in large number packed in a truck, adding that most of them were living in Lagos and went to celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir in their towns and villages. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, said the interception was a proactive step to protect the state against external attack. The task force, headed by Mr. Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, had said the men were arrested following a tip-off by the public, who raised security concern about the manner in which the occupants of the truck conducted themselves.
