The Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA) has shut down 20 health facilities in Lagos State. The facilities were closed in August for non-compliance with regulatory standards. The Executive Secretary of HEFAMAA, Dr. Abiola Idowu disclosed this after an inspection by the agency, stressing that the state government remains committed to putting a halt to the ugly trend of having unqualified personnel in health facilities. Idowu said the state would continue to insist that the environment for the dispensation of medical care should be suitable and hygienic for the promotion and maintenance of good health. She urged members of the public to continue to cooperate and support the government in the fight against quackery and illegal operation of facilities by reporting those behind such acts to relevant government agencies. The HEFAMAA boss also revealed that the agency has witnessed an improved service delivery since the introduction of e-hefama, a technological-based platform to ease registration of facilities and conduct other functions and responsibilities of HEFAMAA.
