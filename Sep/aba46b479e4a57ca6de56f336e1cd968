Forget her pedigree as the daughter of a Yoruba aristocrat and the wife of former Kwara Governor and immediate past President of the 8th Senate. Toyin Saraki is one woman that will continue to remain relevant in our society. She has made a covenant with her creator to assist her quest in combating societal issues like; covering maternal, newborn and child health, gender-based discrimination and violence. The stylish mother of 4 is also an advocate in improving education, socio-economic empowerment and community livelihoods in Africa. The Founder-President of Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA), has never for once gotten tired of rendering humanitarian assistance to her immediate society, most especially, when she was first lady in Kwara and wife of the 8th Senate President. She has galvanised global partnership and championed causes that attracted global attention. On September 6, she celebrated her 55th birthday. The law graduate from the London School of Oriental and African Studies, United Kingdom, is not relenting in keeping up with her passion by making Nigeria and Africa a better place, championing causes that will place Nigeria and Africa on the world map as a more developed continent, free from maternal and infant mortality, domestic violence and child’s right. In the cause of her birthday celebration, she also used the opportunity to facilitate a partnership deal with Lifebuoy soap. A partnership she regarded as the biggest birthday gift. The partnership will enhance distribution of clean and hygiene water for the consumption of rural communities and children. She said: “I am delighted today, on my birthday, as Founder-President of Well Being Africa, to welcome lifebuoy soap to Nigeria in our exciting new partnership to deliver water, sanitation & hygiene to 2 million children, their families & communities in the next 12 months”.
