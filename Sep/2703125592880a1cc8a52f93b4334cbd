The Chairman, Imo State House of Assembly Committee on Public Safety, Intelligence and Securities, Frank Ugboma, has cautioned the former Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha against utterances and actions that could lead to anarchy in the state. Ugboma, who represents Aguata Constituency, condemned the alleged beating of the Chairman, Imo Committee on Recovery of Government Property, Mr Jasper Ndubuaku,  by thugs while on official assignment in Okorocha’s residencein Owerri, the state capital. He told reporters in Lagos that the physical attack on Ndubuaku was wrong because he was carrying out official assignment for the state. Ugboma said: “In 2011 when Okorocha took over from Chief Ikedi Ohakim as Imo governor, he made Dr Placid Ekwueme, his recovery committee chairman and no one attacked him even when he attacked and took away things from people in the road. Ekwueme went to peoples’ homes   to recover alleged stolen property and nobody stopped him. “Why is Okorocha bitter and angry now? Okorocha’s reaction is an affront on a sitting governor and his statement an insult on all of us. It is also a disservice to his office as a lawmaker of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and as a former governor of the state.” He advised Okorocha to seek redress, if he feels aggrieved, instead of making utterances that may lead to anarchy in the state.  Ugboma added: “Any action or statement that may incite people must be taken and treated seriously as treason of sorts considering the state of security in Nigeria.”
