President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the death of a man he called loyal and honest member of staff, Buhari Nalado Sandamu.

In a statement yesterday in Abuja by his Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the President said: “I have lost a good and honest caretaker.” President Buhari prayed for the repose of the soul of the former house keeper, who was popularly called “Commander”. “I have lost a prudent and a wonderful custodian who did so well taking care of my country home in Daura (Katsina State). May Allah bless his soul and give strength to the bereaved family to bear this irreparable loss, Ameen,” President Buhari added. The President also sent a delegation to the family of the bereaved in Sandamu Local Government Area of Katsina State, comprising the SSA, Domestic and Household Matters, Sarki Abba; Garba Shehu and State Chief of Protocol, Ambassador Lawal Kazaure. The President’s Housekeeper Saleh Yuguda was also on the delegation that visited the family of the bereaved. “Commander” died at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Kano, on Monday.
