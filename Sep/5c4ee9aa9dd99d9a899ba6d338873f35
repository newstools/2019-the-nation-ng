It was happiness all the way last Thursday when members of Saint Joseph Secondary School, Idi Mangoro, Agege Lagos (SJSS) 2001 set visited their alma mater to donate musical instruments. They were warmly received by the Principal, Mr. A.A. Iseyemi , who ensured all members of the staff and pupils were on the assembly ground to witness the donation – two big marker boards,  a Yamaha Keyboard with a keyboard stand, and a guitar. The 01 set was represented by Akintan Akinyemi (Chairman); Florence Makinde (Vice Chairman) and Segun Avresivu (Project Coordinator). While addressing the current pupils, the Chairman reminisced on school days by getting the pupils to sing the school Anthem with him.  He admonished them to inculcate the spirit of social responsibility by giving back to their alma mater no matter how small because little drops can make a mighty ocean. He advised the students to take their academics serious to guarantee a secured future. Speaking on the gesture, Isiyemi thanked 2001 set for its yearly contribution to the school. He prayed for their unity to grow stronger and for God’s blessings on them. Head Girl of the School, Onome Isibawo, appreciated the Alumni for deeming it fit to contribute to the school’s growth and development through the donation.
