A Federal High Court in Abuja has struck out a suit challenging the composition of the Federal Government and appointments made in military and paramilitary agencies of the Federal Government. Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment on Monday, held that the plaintiff lacked the locus standi (the legal right to approach the court) to file the suit. Justice Ekwo held that not only was the subject of the suit outside the objectives for which the plaintiff – Incorporated of Kingdom Human Rights Foundation International (KHRFI) – was registered, the group, on whose behalf it claimed to have filed the suit – Igbo Youths Democrats – was not a registered body with the power to sue and be suit. The plaintiff had, in the suit, filed in 2017 and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/81/2017, argued among others that the exclusion of Nigerians of Igbo extraction from the appointments made in most of the agencies of the Federal Government, particularly the military and paramilitary agencies was discriminatory against the Igbo of Nigeria and a breach of the Federal Character principle contained in the Constitution.
