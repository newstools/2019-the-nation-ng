THE Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has charged the National Under- 23 team coach Imama Amapakabo to the West Africa Football Union (WAFU) tournament holding in Senegal from October 28 to November 13 to restore confidence back to Nigerian team after his disappointing outing in Lome, Togo where the CHAN Eagles were humiliated 4 – 1 in the 1st leg Africa Nations Championship. According to a source at the NFF’s Technical Department , the WAFU tournament will determine whether the coach will remain in the employment of the Glass house or not as the competition which has no age limit will be used in to select the best and most experience players against Togo in the return leg of CHAN. “Frankly that scoreline was embarrassing and the coach has admitted that he made some technical blunders. This WAFU tournament is a very good opportunity to do the needful because Nigeria can’t afford not to be in Cameroon for the CHAN championship. NFF will not give any coach ultimatum for any competition but the coach should know that his job will be on line. The home-based Eagles will face Togo again on Saturday in the knock out stage of the WAFU competition before moving into the group stage of the tournament. The Nigeria representative will depart for Senegal today ahead of the match against Togo.
