There are many who believe that women are not corrupt. They see them as angels who can be trusted with anything, especially money. These people will tell you that it is safer to keep money with a woman than a man. This myth has been exploded with what is happening in the society these days. The public has seen how some women in top positions are being accused of embezzling billions of naira. They dip their hands into public till at will and when they are caught, they beg for soft landing. Are women that virtuous or is it just a matter of imagination? Some of them are so cunning in their ways. They use the names of minions to perfect their scheme.  This is what former Benue State Customary Court of Appeal President Justice Margaret Igbeta allegedly did. She was said to have hidden N840 million in her maid’s name. Unknown to the maid, she was a wealthy woman living as a pauper in her madam’s home. With a cool N840 million in the bank, her ladyship retired into a life of bliss until the bubble burst. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has brought an application for interim forfeiture of the money before the Federal High Court in Abuja until the judge gives an account of how she came about the cash. How did she make the money? Was it as a judge or as a lawyer while in practice? Nigerians will like to know as her case comes up in court.
