Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) Chief Security Officer (CSO) Mr Paul Ogidi has urged students of the university to seek the help of the Security Unit when they are faced with security challenges. Speaking with CAMPUSLIFE, Ogidi said the unit noticed that many students do not report security incidents to the unit, which ensures security of lives and property of students. According to Ogidi, students should be free to walk down to the security unit and discuss any matter affecting them. He urged students to see the security unit as the only place they could report cases of robbery, threats to life, oppression, victimisation, and fight, among others. “They should see the security officers as their friends and always walk up to them anytime. The students should not be afraid of coming to report issues to us,”Ogidi said. He continued: “We are here not because of anyone else but the entire students and we urge them all to always get in touch with us.” Ogidi provided some hotlines across the Oye and Ikole axis of the university with which students could reach out to the Security Unit.
