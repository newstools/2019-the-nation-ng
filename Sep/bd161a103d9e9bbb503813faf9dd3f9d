SINGER and song writer, Shola Allyson, who became popular with her hit song, Eji Owuro (Morning Dew), has revealed that she was afraid to sing in her local dialect, Yoruba. Allyson who said it was exactly what she wanted to do, however noted that at the time she started singing, her genre of music was not yet widely accepted in the music industry where foreign music and local hip hop dominated. The songbird, who has since become a household name, on her Instagram page recently, wrote that she had a clear vision of what she wanted to do but there were fears of acceptance because her songs were “sweet, strange and usually deep”. She wrote: “I remember this time… Everything. The struggles. The travails. The eventual breakthrough. The gratitude, but laced with dissatisfaction, restlessness. I had pictures in my head and heart that I didn’t have words to describe. The scanty description I had was misunderstood.The songs I sang were sweet, but strange. The words I used were unusually deep. “The way I rejected my existing reality was daring! The reality of my childhood; how I grew up. The reality of what my life was and what I was supposed to be. The reality of what it was looking like.The reality of what someone who sings in pure ‘local language’ should be. The expected ‘razzness’ that comes with toeing that path. But in my heart and my head, I was always thinking, ‘I’ll sing in Yoruba, sing pure songs, be real omolúàbí and I’ll cut across all classes, my world would be greatly blessed by me!’ She also said, friends and family saw her as been insane. “I tried to share that with ‘trusted’ ones, but they considered me insane and unrealistic. So I kept it to myself but letting the picture I see guide me.Here I am. It has looked like it already. And it is still unfolding! The story is still being written! Kò tíì tán!” Eji Owuro was the soundtrack album for a film of the same name in 2003 After Eji Owuro. She released other albums like Gbe Je F’ori and Im’oore, among others.
