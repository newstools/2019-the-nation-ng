FOLLOWING his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari when he named new heads of some federal government agencies, Senator Basheer Garba Mohammed, has resumed as the new Federal Commissioner at the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons. He is one of the new appointees replacing their predecessors, who were appointed as ministers by the President. Mohammed replaces Sadiya Umar Farouq, the current Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, reads partly, “Senator Basheer Garba Mohammed has been appointed Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons. He replaces Sadiya Umar Farouk.” Speaking to members of staff on his resumption, the new Federal Commissioner, who was a senator representing Kano central senatorial district in the National Assembly, noted that the job of the commission is of national importance and as such, those saddled with the assignments must live up to expectations at all times. While calling for a general staff meeting tomorrow, he urged the departmental heads to be prepared to furnish him with reports on the current situation of things in their various units, the challenges they face and their suggestions on how best to move the commission forward.
