One of the largest landmark entertainment studios, Warner Bros. Studios, will host Del-York Creative Academy(DCA) in Burbank, California. The two-day event organised by the Business Resource Group BE@Warner Bros. will take place in Burbank, California. Selected students from the 2019 class of the Del-York Creative Academy and alumni will participate in the two-day workshops focused around the entertainment industry. Projects from DCA students will be screened on the lot, followed by a panel discussion featuring DCA, University of Southern California (USC) Warner Bros. and other partners from various studios. Also, DCA alumni and special guests will be taken on the full Warner Bros. Studio tour experience for a peek behind the curtain into the operations of one of the world’s largest and most successful studios. The Del-York Creative Academy is Africa’s foremost capacity building institution for film, media, animation & technology. It is pioneering the growth of the African Creative Industry through intensive hands-on training programs while bridging the gap between creatives in the United States and Africa. The academy has successfully flown in 85 lecturers from Hollywood to Africa and trained 1,800 students in over a decade of existence. DCA President and founder, Linus Idahosa, said: “Jack Warner, the esteemed head of Warner Bros. for many years was once quoted as saying, “If I am right 51% of the time, I am ahead of the game. “I believe this visit will give voice to the potential that lies within Africa’s Creative economy. The knowledge exchanged here will also prove itself profitable in the years to come when Africa not only becomes the largest market for media consumers in the world but creates the largest and most effective outsourcing workforce.”
