 As the unending debate over whether or not former Super Eagles  ace Vincent Enyeama should return, Goalkeeper trainer Aloy Agu has told the out of contract safe hand that the ball is squarely in his court. A lot of water according to him has passed under the bridge since the 37 year old quit the Eagles with a lot of competition in all departments especially in goalkeeping. Enyeama he further recalled made the decision to quit, to have more time for his family and returning will depend on his current form on one hand and his ability to compete on the other. “He made a decision that he needed a break, wanting to relax with his family, and if he decides to come back, it is a good one; after all, it is no crime playing for one’s fatherland. But, there is the need to look at performance, because football is all about performance, and that is what Enyeama must show. “The questions we should be asking are how his performance is? Is he back in club football? If you look at the team now, we are having competition in the goalkeeping department and Enyeama must prove he has that x-factor which is performance to come to the negotiation table”, “he told Sports Extra. Enyeama who was capped 101 times has been out of action for close to two years and his attempt to return to club action after leaving Lille, hit the rocks as he failed to seal a contract after trials with French Ligue 1 side Dijon. The former Lille safe hand, who began his soccer career with Ibom Stars made 506 appearances for the seven clubs he played for both home and abroad including Enyimba where he clinched the CAF Champions league back to back. Some soccer fans have however advised him to stay away from the current Eagles as that is the only way the younger ones can rise to the occasion and take the bull by the horns.
