Global financial crisis induced by cybercrimes is imminent unless this is checked, president, Fintech Association of Nigeria President, Dr. Segun Aina, has predicted. Aina who also doubles as the Chairman, Global Banking Education Standards Board, warned that most regulators and operators might not be prepared for the financial downturn. He stated this at the 2019 Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) Lagos State Branch, Bankers & Stakeholders nite in Lagos, stressing that governments of different countries might also not be able to provide bailouts to banks like they did previously in 2008. According to him, banks’ losses to fraud in Nigeria jumped to N15.15bn in 2018, an increase of 539 per cent compared to N2.37bn in 2017, maintaining that internet & technology based sources of fraud accounted for 59 per cent of fraud cases and 43 per cent of actual loss. Citing the NDIC report that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, he said, this rose upward from $3 trillion in 2015. “Global spending on security awareness training for employees is predicted to reach $10 billion by 2027, up from around $1 billion in 2014. Training employees how to recognise and defend against cyber-attacks is the most under spent sector of the cyber security industry.” He noted that the UN E-Government Survey 2018 showed Denmark coming first place while Nigeria ranked 143 out of the193 member countries surveyed. Earlier, the president and Chairman of Council, CIBN, Uche Olowu, said the golden era of digital banking has gained so much significance that according to the 2018 report from Global Market Insight, the Digital Banking Market would cross the $9 trillion mark by 2024. “As we all may already know, the Central Bank of Nigeria as part of its National Financial Inclusion Strategy aims to significantly increase financial inclusion rates from 58.4 per cent recorded in 2016 to 80 per cent in 2020. Banks who choose to operate under the current banking model would hinder the advancement of this policy. On the other hand, banks who choose to stay ahead of the curve can leverage on digital banking to further facilitate the efforts of the apex bank.”
