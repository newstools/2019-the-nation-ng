One of the governorship aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr. Victor Adoji reported to have stepped down for former Governor Idris Wada has stated he is still in the race. He denied stepping down for Wada or anybody for that matter. Spokesman of his campaign organisation,  Abdulahi Usman Adeiza said Adoji was still in the race and was not prepared to step down for anybody. Vice Chairman, Kogi East Elders Council (KEEC) and former minister of State for Health, Arch. Gabriel Aduku, had announced in Lokoja that Adoji, along with four other asparants, have agreed to step down for Capt Wada. Aduku explained that the decision to prevail on the other aspirants to collapse their structure into Wada’s was in the overall interest of the party and the state. But a statement from the Adoji Campaign organisation signed by Adeiza said: “We debunk the devilish and wicked news making round the social media of the decision of Dr. Adoji stepping down for other candidates ahead of the Kogi PDP gubernatorial primaries which will kick start any moment. “This news is of course coming from other opponents who already are afraid of his personality and momentum and have brought up this fake news to confuse our convinced supporters. “We are gaining grounds, moving from Local Government to Local Government and our delegates are in love with us. We are very prepared for the Primaries and shall come out victorious at the end.” He appealed to his supporters to “stay undistracted as we see the hand of God.”
