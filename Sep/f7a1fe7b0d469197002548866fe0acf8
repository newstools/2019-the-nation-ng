THREE suspected members of a notorious kidnap gang have been arrested in Abia State, the police said. Two of the suspects were arrested by mobile policemen on stop and search operation along the busy Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway, the third by regular police through intelligence. Also recovered from the suspects were a mobile phone and an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card later discovered to belong to a kidnapped victim, a woman, who was still in their custody when they were arrested. Two of the suspects were nabbed while ransom negotiations were going on with the kidnapped womanâ€™s husband, said to be a banker. Police sources told our reporter that the mobile policemen flagged down a commercial bus in which the suspects were travelling, and upon interrogation, determined that the two men were members of a notorious kidnap gang. The kidnap was later released by police, while the suspected third member of the gang was picked up. The three suspects were said to have made confessional statements of being behind a series of kidnappings in Aba and other parts of the state. The state police boss Mr Etim Okon confirmed the three suspects were in custody and would be arraigned once investigations were over.
