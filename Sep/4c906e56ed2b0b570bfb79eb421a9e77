The Senate Committee on the Diaspora and Non-Governmental Organisations is set to invite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seek an end to the xenophobic attacks against Nigeria in South Africa. The Committee said it has become very urgent to take decisive action in putting an end to brazen and fatal attacks on Nigerians in all parts of the world. In a statement by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ajibola Basiru, representing Osun Central Senatorial District, warned that if the Nigerian and South African governments do not take prompt and urgent steps to end the incessant bloodshed it could snowball into conflagration with dire consequences for the two countries. The lawmaker harped on the need for the Federal Government to take decisive actions to ease the tension of Nigerians at home and relieve the suffering of those in South Africa in the hands of local miscreants and hoodlums parading themselves as patriots to annihilate Nigerians. However, he warned Nigerians against reprisal attacks on South Africans nationals and investments in Nigeria.
