NIGERIA and South Africa are the two nations that account for almost half of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) but are proving to be a damper on the region’s economic expansion. The two which vie with each other to be the continent’s biggest economy, have both release second-quarter growth data. While the figures will probably show South Africa dodged a recession and Nigeria’s growth quickened, according to two separate Bloomberg surveys, both are expected to show they expanded at a limp pace. The publication of the data comes as political and business leaders from at least 28 African countries prepare to meet in Cape Town on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum on Africa. The discussions will focus on how Africa, which has some of the world’s fastest-growing economies in Ghana and Ethiopia, can expand its potential. “It is obviously going to be a major drag on the continent’s growth if the two largest economies are not performing,” said Ronak Gopaldas, a director at the Cape Town-based consultancy Signal Risk. The data is expected to show the South African economy grew an annualised 2.5 per cent from Q1, and Nigeria’s expanded by the same margin year-on-year. While the slowing global expansion is contributing to South Africa and Nigeria’s tepid growth, the two nations’ economic woes are largely of their own doing continent, due to the weakness of their domestic economies and policies focused on supporting national rather than regional development. The WEF is a discussion meeting rather than a decision-making one, like the African Union. The outlined topics, such as innovation, digitisation, sustainable development and leadership, are more relevant for the more developed countries on the continent, such as South Africa.”
