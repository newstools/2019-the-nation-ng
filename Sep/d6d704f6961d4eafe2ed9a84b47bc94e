He alleged that the teacher sexually harassed his pupil by sending her love messages, pornographic pictures and videos. The accused was alleged to have requested for his pupil’s nude pictures and videos through WhatsApp application. Ayorinde alleged that the defendant was fond of making sexual advances to the teenage girl.

The prosecutor added: “The defendant started sending love messages and nude pictures, thinking he was chatting with the girl, but her mother was reading his messages.” Ayorinde said it was when the accused asked for the girl’s naked pictures and videos that the mother reported the matter to the police and the defendant was arrested. Magistrate Osunsanmi granted the defendant N200,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned till October 16.
