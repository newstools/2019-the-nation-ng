FORMER Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, on Saturday identified the impact of climate change as one of the factors responsible for increasing conflicts in Nigeria. He explained that the changes have created situations that have led to competition for scarce resources. The elder statesman therefore called “for the need to adopt sustainable practices in the way available resources can be used for the common good of all.” He also warned against hate speech, calling on Nigerians to rather raise the bar of peace in the interest of the nation, warning that Nigerians cannot bequeath chaos, disunity, a state of insecurity and hopelessness to the future generation of Nigerians. He spoke at the second Abdulsalami Abubakar Annual Peace Lecture, held in Minna on Saturday. According to him, the level of hate speeches and conflict bedevilling the nation is alarming, so the need for all Nigerians to walk the long road to peace should be emphasised. “As we commemorate the International Day of Peace, we must raise the bar of peace and always walk the long road to peace in all our endeavours. “We cannot bequeath chaos, disunity and a state of insecurity and hopelessness to the future generation of Nigerians,” he said. Abdulsalami, who implored the youths to avoid vices that disrupt sustainable peace and development, advised them to embrace the virtues of tolerance, fairness and respect for human dignity.
