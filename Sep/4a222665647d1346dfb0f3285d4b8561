Award-winning Nigerian poet, essayist, translator and author of short stories, Tade Ipadeola, has been selected to participate in the International Writing Program (IWP) Fall Residency at the University of Iowa, courtesy of the United States (U.S) Department of State. From September 1 to November 16, Ipadeola, the 2013 winner of the Nigeria Prize for Literature, will join 28 other accomplished writers from across the globe in the world’s oldest and largest multinational writing residency. For the 11 weeks, Ipadeola and the other participants will give readings and lectures that share their work and cultures, collaborate with artists from other genres and art forms and travel to interact with audiences and literary communities across the U.S. Besides, the residency will provide the writers a one-of-a-kind inter-cultural opportunity to have productive relationships with colleagues and translators. It would also enable them to take part in the vibrant social and academic life of the University of Iowa as well as the larger American literary scene. U.S Consulate’s Public Affairs Officer, Russell Brooks, congratulated Ipadeola on his acceptance into the residency programme. He noted that the goal of the IWP Fall Residency is to provide outstanding writers with a platform for cultural exchange and collaboration. “The International Writing Program Fall Residency is a unique experience for rising stars and established writers who have achieved literary distinction and have shown interest in contributing to the creative writing culture in their home countries. “This programme will enable Ipadeola to present his works and Nigeria’s literary culture to a wider audience. He will in turn learn more about U.S. society, culture and the American people,” Brooks said.” Ipadeola has three published works, including The Sahara Testament, a poetry collection, which won the Nigeria Prize for Literature in 2013 and has been translated into Dutch, French, Spanish and Xhosa.
