Benue State police command has confirmed that four suspects have been arrested in connection with 10 bodies found buried in shallow graves in a forested community in the state. On Wednesday, police detectives led a suspect to a thick forest in Agbatse village, Ushonho Local Government Area of the state, and exhumed 10 bodies from shallow graves. The suspect, a man of about 30 years, told the police that he killed about 30 people mostly okada riders, and buried them secretly. The suspect said he was acting on the directives of a juju man who prepared a charm for him and said  if he killed a certain number of people he will have supernatural powers like those of wanted criminal gang leader Terwase Akwaza aka Gana. Police spokesperson Kate Anene confirmed the incident and said four suspects  have been arrested in connection with the crime and would be paraded shortly.
