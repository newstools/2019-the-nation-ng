THE Chief Executive Officer, MainOne, Ms. Funke Opeke, has stressed the need to empower the next generation with technology skills. She said technology and internet are two veritable job creators in modern economy. Opeke spoke during  the graduation of 100 youths the firm sponsored in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) training in partnership with EdoJobs. She said: “It gives us immense pleasure to celebrate future nation builders in Edo State, as we know that technology and internet access create jobs and opportunities, either through access to work and skills, or the ability to use the technology to boost commercial activity. “We envision the fibre infrastructure in Edo State bridging the digital divide, with our goal of enabling quality internet access through our ‘Reseller Program’ for as many small businesses that require such services in the state. “We look forward to making Benin City one of the best-connected cities and ultimately Edo State one of the best connected in Nigeria.” Also speaking on the occasion, the Managing Director, Edo State ICT Agency, Mr. Lambert Ugorji, appreciated Governor Godwin Obaseki’s vision to futuristically transform the state. He said: “It is my pleasure to say that Benin City is the only city across Nigeria that has the most fibre spread across the city. The next stage for us is to get youth empowerment, to get people placed in jobs where they can use the skills they have acquired. I am privileged to say; this is just the beginning” The 30-day intensive training implemented through Coven Works, climaxed in a collaborative ‘Grand Graduation Ceremony’ held at the Edo Production Centre, with the graduates demonstrating projects completed using their newly acquired skills. EdoJobs is a Skills Development Programme initiated by the Edo government to transform the wellbeing of the society and its economy by creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities for its citizens.
