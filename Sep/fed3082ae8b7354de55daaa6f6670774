EVERTON manager Marco Silva has a decision to make this weekend, with Alex Iwobi having produced a lively performance in the Carabao Cup against Sheffield Tuesday. The Nigerian started in the number 10 role for the Toffees and appeared comfortable playing in behind Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whom he assisted on the second goal. Iwobi has largely operated as a winger so far, as he did for previous club Arsenal, but the 23-year-old may just have strengthened his case to play centrally. It could mean Silva drops usual starter Gylfi Sigurdsson to the bench, with the Iceland international having struggled to hit top form so far this season. The Icelander hasn’t been his usual dynamic self since the start of 2019/20 and may now lose his starting place. Sigurdsson is one of Everton’s best players but right now he isn’t justifying his continued selection. He has been struggling to impact games and both he and the team may actually benefit from a change in personnel. With Iwobi fresh off the back of a great performance, now could be the ideal time for Silva to make the change. That said, it’s Manchester City up next for Everton meaning it would be a very bold move from the Portuguese.
