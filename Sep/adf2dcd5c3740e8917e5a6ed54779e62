GatesAir has signed an agreement with a Nigerian company to continue the digital TV build-out in the West African nation. The firm, which produces wireless, over-the-air content delivery solutions for radio and TV broadcasters and Pinnacle Communications’ agreement, will allow the expansion of new digital TV services and the digital switchover initiative. The expansion is expected to reach more than 50 million homes and 170 million residents. The licensed signal distributor for Nigeria, Pinnacle Communications, brought a delegation to the GatesAir’s Quincy’s manufacturing facility recently to see the next-generation product designs and readiness to complete Greenfield build-outs. Sir Lucky Omoluwa, chairman and CEO of Pinnacle Communications, highlighted his company’s long relationship with GatesAir, especially the quality. “Sometime in 2016, we had 12 weeks to deliver a station,” Omoluwa said. “All the transmitters were from here. We didn’t do any site testing. We just plugged them in, and they’re still on.” GatesAir CEO Bruce Swail said half of the products GatesAir produces are for international customers, “The broadcasting technology created and built here in Quincy has a huge transformative impact across the globe, and as a result, a lot of people around the world are grateful to Quincy.” Andy McClelland, GatesAir’s Managing Director for the Europe/Middle East/Africa Region, said GatesAir has been on the digital path with Pinnacle for a short time, but will be on it for years to come.
