DIRECTOR General, Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Council in Ekiti State in the last presidential poll, Dr. Olusegun Osinkolu, has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to take the opposition for granted in the forthcoming local government elections in the state. Osinkolu urged the APC leadership to embrace internal democracy and shun imposition of candidates to brighten the electoral chances of the party. The party chieftain, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday, said the APC must allow its candidates to be elected through credible and transparent means. He warned that imposing candidates on the party might cause disaffection that could give the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) an edge in the December 7 council elections. The APC will, on September 28, conduct its primaries to elect the 16 chairmanship and 177 councillorship candidates that will fly the partyâ€™s flag in the council elections. Osinkolu hailed Governor Kayode Fayemi for stating clearly that he had no preferred candidates for the polls.
