The Association of Registered Insurance Agents of Nigeria (ARIAN) has embarked on an insurance walk to sensitise Nigerians on the need to secure their lives and property with insurance. Its President, Ademola Ifagbayi who spoke during the ARIAN Insurance Walk 2019 with the theme: Project S3, Secure Child Education/Secure the Future/Save Nigeria, held in Lagos, said the purpose of the walk was to create awareness on insurance in the country, saying that insurance is very important but many people are yet to embrace it. He urged Nigerians to plan for their future, children and business by having insurance cover. He said: “Whether you like it or not, risk is natural and there is nothing you can do. This year, we are focusing on children education plan. Education is the best legacy that any responsible parent must give to their children because it has become very expensive and many  children are returning back to school. “Many children attend private schools, whether primary or secondary including private universities. This is the time parents will be running around to look for how to pay school fees. But with an insurance policy, a parent can plan for their children’s future by making a regular savings on a monthly basis, quarterly basis, even on annual basis depending on  their capacity. If you want your children to be better than you tomorrow, you must give them education. It is also good for you to have insurance for your business whether you are an artisan, or you are working in an organisation. “I want you all to know that this insurance policy makes provisions in two ways because I know that plenty people will say why do I need to take insurance because I already have accounts with the banks. Taking an insurance policy is different from having a bank account,” he added.
