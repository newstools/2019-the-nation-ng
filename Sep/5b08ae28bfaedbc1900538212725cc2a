GOVERNMENT at all levels have been advised to invest hugely in agriculture in order attract youths. An Anambra industrialist, Chief Walter Chigbo, gave the advice in a chat with newsmen in Awgbu, Orumba North Local Government Area of the state. Chigbo, owner of Nkeonyemetalu Farms and Agro Ventures in the state, said the merits derivable from agriculture are so numerous that youths in the country cannot afford to miss. He said apart from the economic factor, farming offers the opportunity to be closer to nature, as well as guarantee steady fresh and non-preservative foods for consumption. He identified lack of funds, access roads, electricity and other basic incentives as factors hindering many youths from engaging in any form of agriculture. “There are lots of people who are desirous of starting their own farms but are faced with so many hindrances including funds, scarcity of lands, power, access roads, among others,” he said.
