A retired Army General armed with a pistol and a machete, on Thursday afternoon, threatened employees of Ikeja Electric (IE), who visited his residence on Fatai Animashaun Street, Magodo, in the course of their routine duty. According to the Head of Corporate Communications, Ikeja Electric, Felix Ofulue, said: “The victims who are members of the Revenue Protection Team of IE were in Magodo Estate to re-certify and seal prepaid meters. “The objective of the task is to prevent the tampering of meters and ultimately, energy theft. “However, the irate customer who apparently misconstrued the intention of the team from IE, accosted members of the team, with his pistol and machete and in clear terms, threatened their lives. “Despite the pleas and explanations by the team that they were on their routine duty, the customer was hell bent on maiming any of them that dared enter his residence.” This ugly experience depicts an unfortunate situation where people who should know and are expected to uphold the Law are the ones that are perpetrating and advocating mindless violence and lawlessness in our society, Ofulue added.
