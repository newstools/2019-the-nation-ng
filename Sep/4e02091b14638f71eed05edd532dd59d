To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me. In de box, – cuz ain’t nobody checkin me. Love you for Life”, she tweeted. However, the singer’s sudden decision to quit music is not welcomed by her fanbase worldwide. Fans reactions were: @domcorona tweeted, “Nicki stop this. This ain’t funny, I’m not prepared for this”. @bbonquiqui wrote, ” Dear God, if you hear God, make this tweet disappear when you see it. Take away this thought from her when it interferes. We love her too much, to retire”. @violetisgreen tweeted, “I really hope Nicki can do both tho. I am so happy for her starting a family”. The ‘MEGATRON’ Rapstress had reportedly gotten a marriage license with boyfriend, Michael Petty last month, and gone ahead to change her Twitter handle to “Mrs Petty’. The both had since shared photos of each other across social media. At the Queen Radio show last month, Nicki had revealed her excitement in anticipation to her marriage. “We filed for a marriage license, and I had to travel, so when I came back it had expired, we were given 90 days, so we had to renew it again”. “Before the 90 days is over, yes, I’ll be married. I’m very happy about that, because my baby makes me happy. I have to work on my album, so I don’t want to do the big wedding now. I’ll be married before my album comes out, but will have my big wedding after my album comes out”.
