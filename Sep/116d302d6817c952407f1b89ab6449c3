Nigeria’s national basketball team, D’Tigers, defeated Cote d’Ivoire 83-66 to move a step closer to claiming the sole Africa Olympic ticket at the FIBA World Cup in China yesterday. In the 17 -32 classification match played yesterday, the Nigerian team led by veteran Ike Diogu out-scored their opponent in two quarters, one ended in favour of the Ivorians, while the last quarter ended in a draw. The four quarter scores were 24-18, 13-17, 28-11, 20-20 for a total score of 83-66 in favour of Nigeria. After extending their lead by 17 points at the end of the third quarter, the Nigerian team did enough to protect their lead in the fourth quarter to emerge victorious in a game between two leading West African teams. In the final phase of the World Cup qualifiers, Nigeria defeated Côte d’Ivoire in Lagos 84-73 before suffering an away 72-46 defeat in Abidjan to hand the Ivorians a World Cup qualification lifeline. But the D’Tigers moved a step further to confirm their supremacy over their African brothers with the 17 points win.  Vincent Nnamdi, who came up from the bench led the Nigerian team with 15 points, Al Farouq Aminu and Ekpe Udoh had 13 points apiece, while Stan Okoye and Ben Uzoh contributed 10 point each. Diogu, Ike Ireogbu and Josh Okogie also added single digit scores to put a gloss on the scoreline, while Coach Alex Nwora decided to rest his son, Jordan. The Nigerians now has two win from four games – a 50 per cent record. They will take on host – China in their next classification match early tomorrow in Guangzhou. The man of the match, Al-Farouq said that with the new goal being a qualification for the Olympics, the team came out to get the job done. “That is our goal now obviously. We got knocked out of the contention to get a medal so we had to change our vision and continue to make sure that we keep Nigerian basketball, playing every year and compete. So, we want to ensure that we do the best to qualify for the Olympics.”
