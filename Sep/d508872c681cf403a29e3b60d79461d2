A 25-year-old man, Peter Odeh, on Thursday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly breaking into his employer’s warehouse and stealing 33 cartons of beer worth N100, 000. Odeh is facing a two-count charge of breaking and entry and stealing. The Prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Sept. 8 at 12:45 a.m. at No. 39, Alhaji Amoo St. in Ojota, near Lagos. Ihiegie said that Odeh unlawfully entered the warehouse of his employer, Mr Ifeanyichukwu Chime, with intent to commit felony. “After entering the warehouse, the defendant stole 33 cartons of trophy beer, valued at N100, 000 from his employer who deals in sale of drinks.” The prosecutor said that the offences were punishable under Section 287(7) and Section 310(1) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287(7) stipulates a seven-year jail term for offenders while Section 310 stipulates three years imprisonment for offenders. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Magistrate, Mrs Ejiro Kubeinje, granted the defendant bail in the sum on N50, 000 and two sureties in like sum. The case was adjourned until Oct. 8 for mention.  (NAN)
