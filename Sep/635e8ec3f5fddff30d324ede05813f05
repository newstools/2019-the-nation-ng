One person died on Monday night after a car plunged into a river on the NLNG/Nkpogu road, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. There were just two occupants. A middle-aged woman drowned, while the driver was found by the shore unconscious. Local divers and the police retrieved the vehicle from the river yesterday morning. A resident, who pleaded for anonymity, said: “This incident happened on Monday night between 10 and 11pm during the rain. We thought it was a minor accident until the fishermen started shouting that there was a car with human beings inside it this morning (yesterday). “We brought the driver out alive but unconscious before the police arrived. Before we knew what was happening, everywhere was filled with people and they brought a crane to retrieve the car from the river with the help of some local divers.” The driver was said to be receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. Efforts to reach police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni were unsuccessful. One person also died on Monday after a concrete slab caved in at a construction site at the Anwai Campus of the Delta State University, Asaba. There was confusion, putting a halt to academic activities. Anti-riot policemen were called in to restore order and dissuade aggrieved students from protesting. Commissioner for Higher Education Prof. Patrick Muoboghare, who visited the scene, lamented the disaster. The victim’s family has been contacted while the injured was rushed to the hospital. Muoboghare said someone stepped on a wet concrete slab, leading to the collapse of the section on a worker scooping sand. His words: “The workers were setting up a concrete slab. It had not dried before one worker mistakenly stepped on it while carrying a load. You know when you are setting blocks, it must be allowed to age. The concrete must be dry. This has nothing to do with the integrity of the building, as the building is intact.”
