THE Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has suggested that soldiers must be reoriented to prevent the kind of killings and rape committed by soldiers at checkpoints in Taraba, Ondo States and elsewhere. His statement, which was made at a military conference in Abuja last week, seemed to imply that the Army’s junior cadre was more in need of this reorientation. That is not true. All cadres do, without exception. If discipline had not broken down, if soldiers were properly trained and the right professional values inculcated in them, if officers did not indulge troops and sometimes lie to protect them, the killings complained about would hardly occur. Hear Gen. Buratai: “However, recent occurrences have shown that there is a need for more reorientation on civil-military relations and inter-service cooperation at the junior cadre levels. Unfortunately, incidents such as the recent one at Ibi in Taraba State, which generated intense comments, are not healthy for the smooth cooperation and operation of our security forces. I hereby charge commanders at all levels to continue to educate personnel on the need to adhere to the rules of engagement at all times.” Maybe, for starters, the general should ask himself how he and his troops handled the December 2015 Zaria Shiite killings. Was it professional? Could such horrifying killings be committed by any of the world’s best militaries? So who really needs reorientation now? Senior or junior cadre, or both? Gen Buratai then adds that “The army will not condone any form of indiscipline or actions that will tarnish its good image.” He should be honest enough to find out what kind of image the Army he leads already has. He will find that that image is painfully and shamefully sullied by rank indiscipline. If he and his army do not know what to do to arrest the damage, they should ask those who know and stop scratching the rot on the surface.
