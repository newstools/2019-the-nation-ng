The Lagos State Government has announced plans to invest massively on critical infrastructural facilities to make Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the State and indeed the country at large competitive at the global market. The Governor, Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo Olu at the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME) 3rd edition of business roundtable in Lagos, said his administration is willing and ready to invest heavily in critical infrastructure that would accelerate economic growth of the country’s economy, while also empowering the private sector and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) who are real engines of economic growth. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner of Commerce and Industry, Lagos, Mrs. Lola Akande, said the theme of the event tagged, ‘Impact of technology on micro, small and medium businesses in Nigeria’ provides stakeholders the unique opportunity to address one of the major strategies germane to the success of any aspiring and growing business. He reiterated its support for the organised private sector and MSMEs in the provision of critical infrastructure such as power, water, inter modal transportation, waste management among many other initiatives. “All these are geared towards making life more convenient for our people and enhancing the productive capacities of our entrepreneurs,” he said. The Chairman, NASME, Lagos State Chapter, Solomon Aderoju, said based on the fact that MSMEs are the game changers for economic growth and development in any country, it is therefore critical to discuss the impact, importance and role played by technology on MSMEs. In his remarks, the former Managing Director, Ntel, Ernest Akinola, said the current impact of technology on the MSME sector is exponential, adding that technology is displacing the traditional business in Nigeria.
