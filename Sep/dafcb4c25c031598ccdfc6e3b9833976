THE Ondo State secretariat of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has denied posting its members to religious organisations, especially churches. Its spokesman Bankole Simeone made the clarification on Sunday in Akure, the state capital. He said the NYSC secretariat in the state was responding to the trending “fake story” on the social media to clear its name. The spokesman stressed that the secretariat would not go against the established policy of the scheme. Simeone said: “The NYSC in Ondo State has observed with dismay the fake news trending on the social media about a purported allegation that the secretariat has posted some corps members to religious organisations, especially churches. “Ordinarily, one would have ignored the report as a figment of the writer’s imagination. But as a responsible corporate citizen, we do not treat any matter regarding or relating to our esteemed and patriotic corps members with levity. “The story is not only untrue but mischievous, misleading and contains fallacies capable of tarnishing the good image the secretariat is enjoying in the public eye. “Ondo State cannot work at crossroads with the directives or policies of the National Youth Service Corps scheme where it is clearly stated that no corps member should be posted to religious organisations. “We have never done so and we do not intend to compromise on this very sensitive posting policy. “I wish to state categorically that apart from the four key areas, which the policy is clear and unambiguous about, other areas we serve because of their voluntary nature of assignment are non-governmental and cultural organisations.” Simeone added that any posting done in error or contrary to the established policy would be reversed immediately it is brought to the notice of the management. He advised the public to disregard the purported allegations in the social media report.
