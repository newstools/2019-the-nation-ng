Operators in the Non-Metallic Mineral Producers Sub-Sector of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have raised alarm that foreigners have taking over the mining activities in the sector. The National Chairman of the sector, Mr. Mallison Ukatu, raised the alarm over the weekend during a courtesy call by the Commerce and Industry Correspondents Association of Nigeria in Lagos over the weekend. Ukatu frowned that the sector has been invaded due to lack of policy to protect the sector, adding that the future of the sector is at the mercy of these foreign nationals that access cheap funds from their countries of origin. “Foreigners are partially taking over our manning sector; they have almost taking over our mining and supply activities. They have taking over the supply chain and logistics because of the cheap funds they get from their countries and also the encouraging policies they have. What I wish to see is when made in Nigeria goods are being manufactured by Nigerians and not made in Nigeria goods manufactured by the Chinese,” Ukatu stressed. He said; “As the new National Chairman of Non-Metallic Mineral Producers Sub-Sector of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, I am calling on the Federal Government to put in place the proper policy that will drive the sector. There are lots of illegal miners in the sector thereby causing hazards to the nation as a whole, as well as affecting our activities in the sector. “We need policies that will make the sector competitive enough so that we would also have what to bring to the table especially now that the country has signed the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), otherwise Nigeria will lose out. Again, there have been a long battle between tax authorities and manufacturers in the country over multiple taxation of our businesses and if the issue of multiple taxation is not urgently addressed by government, more manufacturing companies are likely to exit the economy.”
