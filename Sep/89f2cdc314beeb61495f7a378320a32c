FAST-RISING artiste, Ojelade Olanrewaju Oluwafe, known as Lbee in music circles, has opined that African musicians should stick to doing strictly Afro music. Stating his reasons, the artiste, who is currently promoting his recently released single Santorini, said Afro music is African heritage and Africans should be proud of it. Lbee also noted that the Afro genre is gotten from Africa. ‘Every African artiste should strictly do afro music. I am an Afro singer, and I love Afro Music. I have the roots of an African boy, so I do afro music well,” he said. “I say that because they are Africans, who should be proud of their heritage. The genre Afro is gotten from Africa. Nigeria is just a major part that created Afro beat, but that does not necessarily mean the whole of Africa can’t keep on with the genre.” Speaking on where he draws inspiration, the YOS records signee said:  “I basically draw inspiration from the things around me, my environment”. He,however, hinted on dropping an Extended Play before the year runs out. “I am really looking forward to dropping a body of work, an EP very soon. That album would have a message to pass across, it’ll be something different. I just want my voice to be heard first. My album will have a single message from the beginning to the end it’ll be passing across. This could help to correct a lot of societal issues we are having now in the country. I’ll make sure the album will not be boring” Lbee’s single Santorini has been enjoying massive airplay both on radio and television.
