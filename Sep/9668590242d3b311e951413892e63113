THE General Manager, Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) Mrs. Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola has restated the resolution of the state government to enforce total compliance with the Greening Provision across the state. Mrs Bilikiss said anyone who fails to comply with the green law would be charged the sum of N250,000. Addressing the media while the agency during enforcement operations at Ikeja, Oniru in Victoria Island, Lekki Phase 1 and Ikoyi environs, the General Manager declared that the pronounced disregard towards greening requirement by private establishments and other property owners across the state is negating government’s efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. “Our resolve to enforce the law against recalcitrant corporate institutions and property owners, who have refused to comply with the state’s provision on beautification of setbacks, is in line with government’s quest to improve the green cover in the state,” she added. “It is disturbing that owners of petrol filling stations, particularly the new entrants, have imbibed the act of concretising their entire surroundings, neglecting the provision of the law which specifically states that a certain percentage of their space must be reserved for greening.”
