PSG of France striker, Neymar; Liverpool’s Firmino, Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus and Bayern’s Philippe Coutinho are among the 23-man squad released by Brazil for next month’s international friendly against Nigeria’s Super Eagles. Brazil will play against Senegal and Nigeria on October 10 and 13 in Singapore. Brazil coach Tite released the list of the 23-man squad yesterday at the Brazilian soccer confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. Tite has also called up striker Gabriel Barbosa for the first time in three years for friendlies holding in Singapore. After flopping at Inter Milan and Benfica, the 23-year-old striker is now the top scorer in the Brazilian championship with 16 goals while playing on loan for leader Flamengo. He was also the competition’s top scorer in 2018 when playing for Santos. “Gabriel has matured. His performance this year speaks for itself,” Tite said. Inter Milan reportedly paid 25 million euros ($27.5 million) for the Brazilian known as Gabigol in 2016, but he has scored only once for the Italian club and is spending a third straight season out on loan. Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson is expected to be the starter in both matches, with Liverpool’s Alisson out with a calf injury. Goalkeepers: Ederson (Manchester City), Weverton (Palmeiras), Santos (Athletico Paranaense). Defenders: Daniel Alves (São Paulo), Danilo (Juventus), Alex Sandro (Juventus), Renan Lodi (Atletico Madrid), Thiago Silva (Paris Saint-Germain), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain), Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Rodrigo Caio (Flamengo)
