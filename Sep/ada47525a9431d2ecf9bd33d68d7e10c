The Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED), which is the umbrella body of the electricity distribution companies (DisCos), has said that the power firms pay all applicable taxes. In a statement by its Executive Director, Research and Advocacy, Barrister Sunday Oduntan, the association debunked the comments credited to Dr. Andrew Nevin, Chief Economist of PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PwC) on Wednesday. The statement reads in part: “Dr. Nevin, at a power sector round table organised by Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited was quoted to have declared that no Distribution Company (DisCo) in Nigeria has paid any tax to the Federal Government since 2013 when they were privatized, because they have been “on a loss-making track” since then. “While acknowledging Dr. Nevin’s effort to highlight the challenges of the sector in his presentation, thus, fostering dialogue that is critical for the resolution of same, we hereby, unequivocally, state that this claim relating to Discos not paying FG taxes is misleading, incorrect and not supported by the facts. “As responsible corporate citizens, all of our member DisCos take their tax obligations to the federal and state governments, as applicable, seriously. As a result, the DisCos diligently pay all necessary taxes that apply to their operations. “These taxes include the minimum Company Income Tax (CIT), Withholding Tax (WHT) and Value Added Tax (VAT). “We will like to encourage all parties interested in the growth and success of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry to constantly diligently verify their information, to avoid creating more challenges than that which already exists in the sector.”
