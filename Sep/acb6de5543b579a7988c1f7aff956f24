Former World champions Brazil are expected to line up a strong squad against Nigeria in the eagerly awaited international friendly fixed for October 13 at the imposing Singapore National Stadium in  Kallang. Though details are sketchy, match organisers  and  NFF/FIFA licensed match  Jairo Pachon of Eurodata Marketing Sportivo E Culturale  (otherwise  known as Eurodata Sports)  informed  NationSport that both sides  would bring their best players for the prestigeous match. “We just closed the deal with Brazil which is historic for Nigeria; and Brazil would bring all their best players for the match,” Pachon stated. Incidentally, the Samba Boys are expected to tackle 2019 AFCON runner up Senegal three days before taking on the Super Eagles in a double header against two strong African sides. “We chose two of the best African teams because they are high level opponents,” Brazil Football Confederation official Juninho Paulista told the country’s association website. “It was a wish of the technical commission. So we went after these opponents.” The October 13th friendly match in Singapore would be the second between both countries  at full international since Brazil hammered Nigeria  3-0 at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja in 2003.
