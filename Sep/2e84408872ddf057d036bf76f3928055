Former National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) President Iyalode Alaba Lawson has said networking is the bedrock of any economy. She spoke at the ongoing Lagos Fashion Exhibition at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island. Mrs Lawson, who was the chairperson at the event, said when people interact, they would make progress, noting that Nigerians are not lazy. She said: ”When we interact with each other, we will make progress. We will learn from each other.” She said in an exhibition, people should be ready to learn, for knowledge is power anywhere, including fashion. She added that the exhibition, which ends today would go a long way in improving the economy. Cote D’Iviore Ambassador to Nigeria Mrs Toure Maman also harped on interaction among people, noting that apart from the fact that it would promote business, it is also good for neighbourliness, especially in the West African sub-region.  She also noted that many women were at the fair, saying this suggests that more women were into the sector. Atlantic Exhibition Limited Managing Director Ayo Olugbade said the exhibition was aimed at providing an enabling platform for networking among businessmen and women, and not just for sales. More importantly, he said, it is to promote entrepreneurship in the fashion industry. He said he expected his colleagues in the industry to make good deals during the three-day event. He thanked his partners in the exhibition, citing Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) for special mention.
