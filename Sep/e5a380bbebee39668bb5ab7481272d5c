SUPER Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen will be aiming to start his Champions League campaign on a bright note as Lille visit Ajax at the Johan Cruyff Arena tonight. Other Nigerians playing today include Paul Onuachu and Stephen Odey (Genk) and Peter Olayinka (Slavia Prague). Osimhen has been in a superb goal-scoring form for his French club after netting against Angers in the Ligue 1,to become the first player to score five goals in his first five French top-flight outings. However, his attention will be shifted to Tuesday’s clash against an Ajax side that made the last four of the UEFA Champions League last season, with the aim to continue his goal-scoring form. A trip to the Johan Cruyff Arena is a daunting way for Lille to make their Champions League return, having not featured in the competition proper since 2012-13. However, it is certainly a step up from their last European foray – defeat to Qabala of Azerbaijan in the third qualifying round of the 2016-17 Europa League – and also they have had to cope with the loss of a star player in Nicolas Pepe.
