Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has revealed that the delay in constituting his cabinet is as a result of his desire to carry along all the different parties and groups that contributed to his second term mandate. The governor explained that the process of nominating Commissioners in his second term is taking a lot longer time, due to the emergence of different forces that supported him during the 2019 election. Speaking during a foreign Hausa Radio programme, monitored in Kano, Ganduje, promised to unveil the names of the prospective Commissioners soon. “Some of my former commissioners will be re-nominated while others will not. However, those that are not returning, as commissioners will still be accommodated in the government.” he said. To this end, it was learnt that, political considerations appeared to have made it difficult for the governor to form a cabinet. In 2015, Ganduje ran for election as a candidate of the Kwankwasiyya group within the APC. It was therefore easy for the group to agree on their nominees for commissioners even before Ganduje took the oath of office. However in 2019, running as the head of his own Gandujiyya faction, Ganduje needed the support of other political blocs in order to defeat the Kwankwasiyya candidate after the group decamped to the opposition PDP. Among the frontline politicians, who threw their weight behind Ganduje’s ambition, include a serving Senator and former governor, Ibrahim Shekarau, former deputy governor, Prof Hafiz Abubakar and a host of some notable Kwankwasiyya and PDP members, who decamped in protest against the alleged high-handedness of the group leader, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso.
