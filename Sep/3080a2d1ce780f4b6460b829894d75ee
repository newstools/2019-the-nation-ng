Lagos State government has been tasked on increased budgetary allocation to the health sector as well as full and timely release of allocated budget to the sector. This was said by the Executive Director, Child Health Advocacy Initiative (CHAI), Elizabeth Alonge during an Advocacy Visit  by NGOs in Partnership for Advocacy in Child and Family Health at Scale ( PACFaH@Scale) Project in Lagos State to the Office of the Commissioner for Health, Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi Alonge who spoke on behalf of PACFaH@Scale Project in Lagos State, commended the State for achieving a feat in maternal and child health in  Nigeria as a state with the highest percentage (29%) of women using modern planning and the lowest percentage of children under 5 years (1.7%) in the country, among others. Her words “ Lagos State government is also exemplary in working closely with NGOs in the health sector and in making public statement about the continuing health challenges in the state. However in 2018, Lagos State allocated N92.5 Billion (9% of the total budget to the health sector) but released only N27.4 Billion which was 29.6% of the allocated sum” said Alonge. The group therefore requested for the following: Increased partnership funding for family planning and routine immunization; re introduction of health volunteer’ scheme; Increased budgetary allocation to the health sector, among others. Responding, the Commissioner for Health, Lagos State, Prof. Akin Abayomi reiterated Governor Babajide Sanwoolu’s  commitment to the  health  sector. He said, “our Governor has made health issue his primary concern, he understands clearly that Primary Health Care System is the backbone of Lagos Health Scheme”. Professor Abayomi pointed out that despite the feat achieved by the state in the health sector, a whole lot still needs to be done in the area of adequate health delivery to the vulnerable in the state
