OLUJONWO Obasanjo, son of former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday told an Ikeja High Court that he had not been able to serve divorce papers on his estranged wife, Temitope. Olujonwo and Temitope, daughter of a frontline lotto magnate, Sir Kessington Adebutu alias “Baba Ijebu” were absent when the matter came up in court before Justice Bisi Akinlade. Olujonwo’s counsel, Olayinka Kujembola, told the court that they have made series of attempts to serve Temitope in Abeokuta to no avail. Kujembola said the court sheriff who visited her Ikoyi, Lagos residence complained of tight security  around the place, making it impossible to serve her. The trial judge expressed her displeasure that the petitioner has not been able to serve his wife,  Temitope. Justice Akinlade noted that the divorce suit has been popular in the media since it started about five months ago, adding that efforts should have been made to serve Temitope in Ogun where she works and resides. The judge declined to grant the applicant’s request for an order of substituted service in Lagos. “The respondent stays in Ogun State. Why do you want me to grant an order for substituted service for Lagos where she does not stay?. Justice Akinlade  opted to adjourn the case the second time to enable the bailiff serve Temitope directly. She adjourned the case until October 2 for hearing of pending applications. During the last proceedings held May 23, Olujonwo’s counsel, Ms Omo Omofoma had told the court that several attempts were made to serve Temitope by Olujonwo to no avail. Olujonwo and Temitope had a grand wedding  between May 11 and 13, 2017 but which crashed few months after. Prior to their wedding, Olujonwo’s mother, Mrs Taiwo Obasanjo had filed a suit at Ikeja High Court seeking the postponement of the wedding. The then trial judge, Justice Lateefa Okunnu dismissed the suit on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear it in view  of the fact that Olujonwo was then 33, and an adult.
