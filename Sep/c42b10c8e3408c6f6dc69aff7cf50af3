THE two best African players – Aruna Quadri of Nigeria and Egypt’s Omar Assar will come up against each other in the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) Champions League tomorrow in Dusseldorf, Germany. Assar, who plies his trade with Borussia Dusseldorf will host Quadri in Germany as Dusseldorf, former champion, battles Sporting of Portugal. Though Quadri’s Sporting bowed to the German team last season, his present form is a threat to European players. Drawn in Group D alongside Sporting of Portugal, STK Starr of Croatia and GV Hennebont of France, Omar Assar has admitted that the tie against Sporting remains the biggest threat to their ambition in Europe this year. “It is going to be a tough season with new strong player joining the team. This is also the Olympic Games season and everyone is focusing on qualifying. We are very lucky to have myself and Timo Boll already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in singles and team and I am sure other players in the team will be aiming to secure their places at the Games. According to ETTU, Borussia Dusseldorf is clear favourite in Group D, having retained the services of the five players – Germany’s Timo Boll, Sweden’s Kristian Karlsson, India’s Sharat Kamal Achanta, Aaasa and Sweden’s Anton Kallberg that did the team proud last season, while German Richardo Walther returns to the Dusseldorf’s side.
