Amarava Rice Mill based in Kano is poised to double its rice production capacity this month. Amarava, the first end-to-end made-in-Nigeria rice mill,  was  inaugurated in the fall of 2017 by President Muhammadu Buhari. The mill is to boost its production capacity by over 100 percent, to the tune of 500 metric tonnes daily even as it is heavily investing in the expansion of its mills. The  Chairman, Fullmark Group (parent company of Amarava Agro Processors Limited), Sriram Venkateswaran, in an interview,  said the drive to boost capacity was geared towards promoting government diversification effort,to  reduce independence on the importation of rice and improve food security. “Currently, we produce 250 metric tonnes of rice per day, and with the coming expansion of our millers, we are set to double this capacity. This serves as positive reinforcement for our local rice farmers because they will increase hectares used for rice cultivation. Not only that, we are engaging more farmers who will be directly involved in the cultivation process thereby boosting the agricultural productivity of the Nigerian economy”, he noted. He noted that the expansion of the millers beyond its current capacity is bound to generate more jobs both directly and indirectly across the country, assuring that Nigeria is on the journey to attain its true status of the ‘food basket of Africa’. Venkateswaran urged the government at all levels, particularly the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to continue in its support for the agricultural revolution underway, by committing more funding for agricultural investors and instituting enabling policies for local farming.
