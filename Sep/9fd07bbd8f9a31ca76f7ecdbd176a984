The Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu has been urged to probe the alleged extra-judicial killing of one Chinedu Obi at Sango Police Station in Ogun State. A statement by the Conference for the Actualisation of Human Rights said lawyers of late Obi’s family described comments by the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Abimbola Opeyemi, as “far from the truth”. The rights group gave the police a seven-day ultimatum to start investigating the matter. The statement signed by the group’s national coordinator and secretary, Omemiroro Ogedegbe Esq. and Comrade Ozobo Austin, respectively, said the deceased had travelled to Otta on July 19 in a bid to advance his music career. The group said Obi died following a confrontation with policemen at the station. Until his death, Chinedu Obi, from Utagba Ogbe, Ndokwa West council area of Delta State, was a final year student of the Department of Physics, University of Port Harcourt, Choba in Rivers State.
