As skeletal rehabilitation work on the Iwo Osogbo road has begun, the Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, Telu I, has praised Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola for fulfilling his campaign promises to the people of Osun West. In a statement by him, Oba Akanbi, who hoped that full work would start after the rainy season, said he was not disappointed by the governor’s disposition to the people of Iwo and its environ. Describing the governor as a God-fearing politician and a unique administrator, the Oluwo said through the road, the people of Osun State, particularly those from Osun West, will be able to improve “our bilateral economic interaction with neighbouring states.” He said the people of Iwo and adjoining communities appreciated the governor’s understanding of the socio-economic importance of the road and the contribution of the people of the area to the economy of Osun State by the time the road is put back in good shape. He assured the governor of continued support of his subjects to his administration, saying: “Collectively we have resolved to ensure success of your government.” The monarch advised the people to pay their tax regularly to enable the government play its statutory roles. He said: “The governor is a man of God for opening the major road to Osun West Senatorial District as pledged during his campaign at my palace. I pray for more divine strength for our governor to fulfil other promises to the good people of the state.”
