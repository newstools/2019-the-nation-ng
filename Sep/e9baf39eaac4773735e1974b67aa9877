MALLAM Abdulrazzaq Ibrahim Salman, the President of Abibakr As-Sidiq Philanthropic Home, an Islamic charitable organisation in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, has condemned the drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in Khurais and Abqaiq. He described the actions as acts of terrorism. In a statement on Sunday, the Islamic cleric, who is also the Director of the Nigerian office of the World Muslim Congress and a member of the Executive Council of the congress, said the attacks lacked any moral justification. He said they have no basis in the holy Qur’an and the teachings of the holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW), called the Sunnah. “I call on the global community to stand strongly with Saudi Arabia government and the people of Saudi as such attacks on civilians and economic facilities are capable of causing additional unimaginable humanitarian crisis across the world,” Malam Abdulrazzaq said. The popular cleric urged Muslims across the world to pray for Saudi Arabia at its critical moment as “any attack on Saudi Arabia is an attack on the entire Muslim World. The security and stability of the Kingdom is key to the fulfilment of Islamic rights and obligations”.
