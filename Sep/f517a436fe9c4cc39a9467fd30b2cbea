EMBATTLED Super Falcons’ coach, Thomas Dennerby may have kissed his job goodbye contrary to his claim that he was still under contract with his employers, Nigeria Football Federation ( NFF). The NationSport  scooped  the Swede tactician resigned before he abandoned the Super Falcons midstream into their decisive Tokyo 2020 Olympic  qualifier against Cote d’Ivoire to be played over two  legs on September 30 in Abidjan with the reverse fixture in Lagos on  October 6. “Dennerby officially resigned and nobody forced him to leave,” a competent source at the NFF told NationSport.  “We can’t leave the Super Falcons without a coach and somebody must be in charge for now. “Coach Chris Danjuma was drafted in as a stop gap; any further decision to be taken must be after the African Olympic Games qualifier against Cote d’Ivoire home and away matches.” The Minister of Youth and sports, Sunday  Dare only last week stepped into the matter but his widely planned parley with Dennerby on Saturday did not hold as expected with words rife that the Minister  wants to get a clearer picture of the imbroglio between the two feuding  parties. Though Dennerby initial two-year contract will run out in June in 2020; the NFF may have commenced the process of recruiting a substantive head coach for the senior female national team. Our correspondent gathered that the federation’s technical department is in receipt of at least five applications for the  job and the names being mentioned include that of current caretaker coach Christopher Danjuma, Rivers Angels’ coach Edwin Okon as well as immediate past assistant to  Dennerby and former Nigerian international , Maureen Mmadu amongst others.
