THE Construction Manager, Alaro City, Bailey Ligtas, said the firm has adopted innovative infrastructure building systems that serve as benchmark for new cities in the country. Speaking with reporters after a tour of the city in Lekki Free Zone (LFZ), Lagos, he said the road was designed by leading engineering firm, Over Arup & Partners, the first of four major access points from the Lekki-Epe Expressway, just metres from the gate of Alaro City. “Alaro City is also developing an independent power plant solution by connecting to a nearby gas pipeline. Water supply for the first phase is also at an advanced stage,” he said. Its CEO, Odunayo Ojo, said the city has already sold out phase one of its residential “buy-and-build” plots, with phase two well underway, adding that several individuals, regional and multinational companies are building commercial and industrial facilities in the city. “Alaro City lies in the growth path of Lagos and aims to serve as a model for what a modern mixed-use city looks like. We have partnered with renowned experts in various fields to ensure that our culture of high standards is sustained.” Launched in January,  the city is planned as a 2,000-hectare new city located in the Northwest Quadrant of the LFZ. The city will include industrial and logistics locations, complemented by offices, homes, schools, healthcare facilities, hotels, entertainment and parks and open spaces. The project is a joint venture between the Lagos State government and Rendeavour, the largest new city builder in Africa. In building Alaro City, Rendeavour provided solutions to urban planning and city-building problems unique to Lagos.
