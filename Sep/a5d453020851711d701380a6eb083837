The state of insecurity in the country was clearly illustrated in Benue State when a stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on his way to a security meeting was abducted by gunmen before he got to the venue. Mr Ben Akile, a chieftain of the PDP, was travelling from Zaki Biam to Katsina Ala in Benue North-East senatorial district when the vehicle he was riding in was stopped by gun-wielding men who seized him and took him away. Akile was on his way to attend a zonal meeting of the party where attendees were scheduled to discuss the insecurity in the middle belt and proffer solution to it. MrÂ  Gabriel Suswam, a former governor of the state, was billed to be at the meeting. An eyewitness Paul Unande told The Nation that Akile was travelling alongside other top party leaders in a vehicle belonging to state party legal adviser Mr. Tela Mue when the gunmen stopped them. It was learnt that the abductors shot at them from the bush, robbed them of cash and other valuables before taking Akile to an unknown destination. At press time the gunmen were yet to contact the family of the victim.
