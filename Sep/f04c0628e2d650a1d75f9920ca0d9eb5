A Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday remanded a man, Ayobiojo Hammed, who was allegedly caught peddling marijuana at the Lagos Command of the National Drug Laws Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Justice Sule Hassan kept Hammed, of 7, Moshalashi Street, Empire, Surulere, Lagos, in prison custody, following his plea of guilty to a one-count charge of unlawfully distributing 630 grammes of the narcotic drug. He adjourned till October 11 for review of the facts of the case and sentencing. Earlier, NDLEA prosecutor Fingere Dinneys alleged that Hammed was arrested on March 26, 2019, while distributing 630 grammes of the substance to some construction workers on the NDLEA’s premises, No. 4, Shaw Road, Ikoyi, Lagos. The court heard that the defendant’s offence infringed Section 20(1)(a) of the NDLEA Act, 2004 and was punishable under Section 20(2)(a) of the same Act. Following Hammed’s plea, his counsel, C. W. Ezeonyeziaku, who stood in for Mrs. Susan Agu, did not oppose the prosecution’s remand application. The charge against the defendant marked FHC/L/198c/19, reads: “That you Ayobiojo Hammed, Male, Adult, of 7, Moshalashi Street, Empire Surulere, Lagos on or about 26th March, 2019, at 4, Shaw Road, Ikoyi, Lagos without lawful authority distributed 630 grammes of Cannabis Sativa otherwise known as Marijuana, a narcotic drug similar to Cocaine, LSD and Heroin and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 20(1)(a) and punishable under Section 20(2)(a) of the NDLEA Act 2004”.
