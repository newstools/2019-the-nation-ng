 Ousted Champions league campaigners Enyimba say there is no time to lament over their ouster revealing that they have decided to re-channel effort and focus to the Confederation cup play-offs. The Peoples Elephants were edged out no thanks to a lone goal aggregate by Sudanese side Ah Hilal. The two time CAF Champions league winners further apologised for keeping their followers in the dark while the battle of Omdurman was on Sunday, blaming poor network. “We sincerely apologise, once again, for the inability to provide full updates of yesterday’s match against Al Hilal on our media channels. It was the result of severe network challenges encountered in Omdurman. The team has returned to Nigeria and will now focus on the CAFCC” Meanwhile draw for the 16 teams who progressed into the group stage of the CAF Champions league will hold on the Wednesday October 9 in Cairo Egypt.  Many say the group stage promises to be full of fireworks considering the pedigree of most of the teams that scaled through. After an eight-year absence, JS Kabylie of Algeria, winners in 1981 and 1990, are back to the group stage, joined by rivals, USM Alger, losing finalists in 2015. Five-time champions, TP Mazembe from DR Congo who enjoyed a cruise control over Fosa Juniors of Madagascar thanks to a 3-1 victory sealed a third successive group stage berth. And they have company in perennial rivals and 1973 winners, AS Vita, who also made it three in a row at the last 16. Eight time winners Al Ahly of Egypt are hitting the group stage for the fifth season on the row.
