To bring financial empowerment to the fore, a pension fund administrator, AXA Mansard Pensions Limited, has charged Nigerians on the need to plan for retirement to avoid old age poverty. In a statement, the firm’s Chief Executive Officer, Dapo Akisanya, emphasised the importance of retirement planning. According to him, old age is one of the neglected themes of our society. He said though everyone was aware of it and knew it would happen, many still shy away from it. He said: “Regardless of how we shy away from it though, we will all get old. Therefore, there is no need to avoid the topic or bury one’s head in the sand. Older people are more vulnerable, and also face a higher probability of living in poverty. “The world is experiencing improved life expectancy and an ageing population, which means the proportion of older people continues to rise. Nigeria is not excluded from this trend. More people are having fewer children and, in many countries, living longer. ‘’According to the United Nations (2015), the speed of population ageing in many developing countries today is significantly faster than occurred in developed countries in the past. As such, today’s developing countries must adjust faster to ageing populations and often at much lower levels of national income compared to the experience of countries that developed much earlier. “Many times, with old age comes a decline in capacity for work and, therefore, income-earning ability. This is coupled with potentially higher expenditure on health care and other essential services, increasing the likelihood of older people becoming and remaining poor. Older people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of economic change, and those without savings, assets, or the capacity to generate income, are among the least able to withstand economic shocks.” He stressed that the means of reducing old-age poverty and avoiding the difficulties faced by multi-generational households is through a pension plan.
