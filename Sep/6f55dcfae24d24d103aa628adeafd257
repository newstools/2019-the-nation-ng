Years after losing their only child, Mrs Funmilola Abiloye had a set of triplets. One died at birth, but feeding the two survivors is a burden she and her husband Michael think they cannot bear. Mrs Abiloye, a housewife and sickle cell patient, and her husband, an artisan, live in Ikotun in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State. She said, “How can I survive this economic predicament, as I and my husband find it difficult to afford two meals a day. I was in state of confusion, when findings revealed that I’m going to deliver triplets. There is no hope of raising the babies, in view of the bad economy. Raising money for the hospital bills is a challenge. Chief Medical Director, Zion Hospital, Dr John Adanike said five doctors battled to save Mrs Abiloye and her remaining two babies who were delivered at their facility. One of the babies weighed 1.9kg, the other 1.5kg. Mrs Abiloye should follow up her post-natal treatment to guarantee her safety, Adanike said.
