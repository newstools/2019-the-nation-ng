In his reaction to the xenophobic attacks against Nigerians and other Africans in South Africa, Senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani has said, Nigeria must send a loud and clear message to South Africa that, Nigerian lives matter. Senator Sani who described the attacks as shocking, deeply disturbing and an affront on African unity, equally frowned at the nonchalance of the South African authorities. The Senator, in a statement made available to newsmen in Kaduna, condemned the inaction of the South African authorities, saying it betrayed the long-standing relationship between Nigeria and South Africa, strengthened by “the frontline role played by Nigeria in the apartheid struggle”. While carpeting the South African leaders for “inaction” and describing their lack-lustre disposition on the matter as highly condemnable, the Senator said, “the seeming nonchalance of the South African authorities has reinforced the perception in informed circles that there may indeed be complicity from the highest level”. The lawmaker noted that the message for South Africa must be loud and clear, that Nigerian lives matter. “Henceforth no country or people must be allowed to harrass, humiliate or intimidate our people. The principle of reciprocity must be applied in our dealings with other nations and their people.” The Senator warned. Senator Uba Sani, however, commended Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan for condemning in strong terms the xenophobic attacks, while applauding President Muhammadu Buhari for dispatching a special envoy to the South African President and directing the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister to summon the South African Ambassador to Nigeria”.
