Gonin Gora, a community in the outskirt of Kaduna metropolis has pleaded with Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s goverment to upgrade the Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in the community to a general hospital. This was as the community commended the Governor for the road construction works in the area. The community made the call during a press briefing at the Sarki’s (Village Head) Palace on Monday. The Village Head, Chief John Dodo Yusuf Sarki while commending Governor El-Rufai said, previous goverments in the state made several promises to the community, which were not fulfilled. The Village Head appealed that, upgrading the community’s Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) to a General Hospital, will enable the hospital take care of the health needs of the ever expanding community. According to him, “we are very happy today that, Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai has turned Gonin Gora to Small London. Anyone that came to our community in the recent past and comes back today will see that, development has come to Gonin Gora. “Goverments in the past have made series of promises to us without fulfilling them. But today, under the goverment of Malam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, we now have roads. “As part of measures to show our appreciation to the goverment, we have put in place measures to maintain the roads. For example, we have carried out enlightenment programme and told our people to preserve the road by avoiding dumping refuse in the drainage.” He said.
