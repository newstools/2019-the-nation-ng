Since the news broke on August 16 that a British court had given Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID) approval to seize Nigerian government’s assets worth $9.6 billion, President Muhammadu Buhari has not hidden his desire to get the matter investigated . The President wants Nigerians whose hands were soiled in the failed project to build a gas processing plant in Calabar, Cross River State’s capital, punished. In New York few days ago, he came hard on the project, dubbing it a scam. He is determined to know who played what role in Nigeria getting into the trap of P&ID, why the contract terms were not properly vetted, and why no one seemed to care about its execution. It has come to light, however, that members of the team constituted by the President to investigate the matter are divided over what approach should be adopted by the country to get over saga. While some members of the team share the President’s passion about investigating the matter, getting to the roots of it and punishing the culprits, others believe that investigation is not only time wasting but could lead the country to nowhere. The other group is, however, miffed by the proposal, wondering how anyone could be talking of a deal with “facilitators of a dubious contract.” They believe that Nigeria has a good case and should push on with the ongoing legal battle in the hope that the court will quash the judgment awarding $9.9 billion damages against the country. Although the team put together by the President appears to be forging ahead going by the go-ahead given Nigeria few days ago by a United Kingdom court to challenge the judgment, SENTRY can reveal authoritatively that all is not well with it. If the pro-arbitration option had their way, those rooting for thorough investigation would have been dropped from the team and   sent home from London where the team relocated to early in the week.
