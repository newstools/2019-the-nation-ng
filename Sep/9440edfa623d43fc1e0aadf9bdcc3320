Former President Goodluck Jonathan and a former Managing Director, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Timi Alaibe, were two of the biggest losers in the just-concluded primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State. The former President was the first to cast his vote at the primaries, but at the end of the election, Alaibe, widely believed to be Jonathan’s candidate, failed to clinch the party’s ticket. Alaibe was defeated by Douye Diri, the Senator representing Bayelsa Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, who was widely believed to have been backed by Governor Seriake Dickson. Political observers believe that Diri’s victory in the shadow election has further strengthened Governor Dickson’s grip on the party’s machinery in the state. In fact, Jonathan has been quiet since the emergence of Diri and has yet to congratulate the PDP candidate for the November 16 governorship election in the state. Alaibe, who was upbeat during the primary, showed a lot of strength but felt betrayed by delegates who had assured him of their votes in the poll that was characterised by vote buying. The former NDDC boss, who came second, has since issued a statement lamenting his defeat and unfulfilled dreams. He, however, vowed to continue pressing forward in his quest to govern the state.
