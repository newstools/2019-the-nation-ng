The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has vowed to stage a peaceful protest against President Mohammadu and his government at the United Nations General Assembly in the United States of America. It said the demonstration was to prove its resoluteness and determination for the actualisation of Biafra republic and Buhari’s tyrant style of leadership. The group, in statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said its members in the US had perfected arrangement necessary for the protest. It noted that it was aware Buhari departed Abuja for New York with three governors and seven ministers to attend the General Assembly. The statement partly reads: “IPOB family worldwide especially our great family members in the US are on ground waiting for Buhari to appear in the United Nations General Assembly this week, the General assembly is scheduled to start deliberation from 25th of September 2019 in the city of New York. “Our people in the US perfected every arrangement necessary to protest against Buhari and his government in Nigeria during the summit to prove our resoluteness and determination for the coming of Biafra and how tyrant Buhari has become. “The world must understand why Biafrans need outright freedom from unworkable system of Nigeria without much delay. “Buhari and his Fulani government in Nigeria have totally destroyed this country and we must let the world know what transpired between Biafra and Nigeria since 1945 till date. “IPOB is going to stage a powerful and unprecedented protest against him in US for the purpose of continued and incessant killing, arrest, destruction of properties and secret abduction of Biafrans both men, women and children every day and night in Biafraland. “The plans by Fulani government of Nigeria to stop IPOB from demanding their right for free state and independent nation of Biafra will not work. “The whole world must see IPOB right in front of UN headquarters in New York.”
