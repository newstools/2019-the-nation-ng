25-year-old Kehinde Muse has committed suicide after his 21-year-old lover dumped him. The incident occurred at 56, Modele Street Surulere, Lagos Mainland. His case brought to five, the number of suicide incidents reported to the police since July. It was gathered that his lover, Rasheedat Animashaun, had dumped him two weeks ago because of his alleged high libido. The Nation gathered that the young woman had complained Muse liked sex and she could not cope with it. Another issue, it was gathered, stemmed from the fact that the young man was not working and depended on the girl financially. “The guy was not going anything. It was the girl that was working as an office secretary. “She was the one taking care of him financially. He was even sent to learn how to repair air conditioners but he did not achieve much there. “So, two weeks ago, the girl said she was tired and dumped him. She complained that all he does was sit at home, eat free food and then have sex countless times,” a source said. Unable to accept their breakup, Muse was said to have sent a message to Animashaun threatening to commit suicide if she insisted on leaving him. She was said to have notified his parents about the message who ran to his room only to discover that Muse had drunk a poisonous substance suspected to be sniper. His parents were said to have rushed him to a hospital but he died on arrival. Confirming the incident, police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said: “Preliminary investigation revealed that the deceased person earlier sent a suicide text message to his ex –girlfriend, informing her that he will take his life since she decided to quit the relationship. “The said girlfriend promptly informed his family about the text message he sent to her and they rushed to his house, broke the door and found him unconscious. “He was rushed to the hospital but did not make it. His corpse has been deposited in the mortuary for autopsy.”
