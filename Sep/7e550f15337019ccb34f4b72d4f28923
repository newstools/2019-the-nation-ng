AS the polio immunisation for children between 0-59 months began last Saturday across 10 local governments in Sokoto State, it is observed that mobilisation and awareness advocacy have influenced compliance in communities, as against the previous exercise. Most of the local governments have designed work plans to ease and encourage compliance by the residents. This has made it easy for vaccinators to access homes, to enable children get immunised. In some cases, some of the children defied their parents’ attitude against immunisation and get vaccinated. Wurno Local Government targets 69,280 for the MOPV4 exercise. On the first day of the exercise at Wamakko town, in Wamakko Local Government, over 50 pupils of Marassatul Hadith Islamiyya were vaccinated out of a targeted 70,340 children expected to be covered in the exercise. Addressing reporters who monitored the exercise, the headmaster, Malam Abubakar Liman, said the efforts of stakeholders for creating awareness, mobilisation and persuading households with the support of the community and ward leaders had changed the attitude against compliance. Listing the progress so far made, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Local Government Area Facilitator, Mr. Dahiru Arkilla, said it had immunised 47,540 children from the start of the exercise, adding: “We embarked on a two-day Direct Observed Polio Vaccine Exercise before commencing on the house-to-house immunisation.”
