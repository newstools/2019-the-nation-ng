THE Minister of Communications,  Dr Ibrahim Pantami on Monday gave the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) September 26 to rectify all improperly registered subscriber identity module (SIM) cards in the country. Pantami, who received the Management Team of the Commission in his Office in Abuja, however, praised the Commission for its ability to reduce the number of improperly registered SIM cards from 9.2 million to 2.42 million within one week. He told the team led by its board Chairman Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye that it had become necessary to ensure that not a single SIM card is being used in the country without proper registration considering its security implications and the challenges facing the country. Pantami said: “Based on the report I received today from the NCC, within the period I issued a statement on improperly registered SIM and now, they were able to reduce the number significantly. “Within this period, they were able to rectify at least over 6. 775 million lines with incomplete registration of SIM cards.  So the total number of incomplete registration of SIM cards as it is today based on the repoert I recieved is 2.42 million.  So the reduction within this period is about 73. 2 per cent. “This is a significant achievement from 9.2 million we are back to 2.4 million.  Within this period, 6.775 million have been rectified and this highly commendable.”
