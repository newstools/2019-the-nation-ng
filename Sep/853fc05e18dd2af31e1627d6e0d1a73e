La Casera has joined the people of Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, to celebrate the 2019 Udiroko festival. The Udiroko festival is celebrated every August as a climax of the New Yam celebration. The 709 edition held between August 10 and 25. The La Casera team earlier visited the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe Aladesanmi III, to felicitate with him and the people. Kolanuts were broken and prayers said for the peace and prosperity of the community. The next stop for the train was the brand sponsored Ewi Cup Football Final, followed by the Udiroko Street Activation and Sampling Day, which held before the grand finale of the festival. The La Casera train also toured the beautiful city of Ado-Ekiti, leaving behind a trail of merriment, dance and invigorating apple goodness. Senior Brand Manager Ruth Ode said the brand will remain at the forefront of promoting culture and tradition in Nigeria, hence its continued participation in the Udiroko Festival and other cultural festivals in the country. Oba Aladesanmi in his address noted that the festival is devoid of the fetish practices associated with many traditional ceremonies. He said: “It is a fiesta organised to showcase the historical, cultural and traditional potentials of the people of Ado-Ekiti.” At the La Casera pavilion, the brand excited consumers and treated them to games such as Ayo, Ludo and drafts. Participants energised with refreshingly cold La Casera Apple, jostled to hold on their winning streaks for as long as possible, as they won various branded gift items and free cases of La Casera.
