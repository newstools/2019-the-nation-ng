Emir of Lafia Justice Sidi Bage (retd) has expressed dismay over the falling standard of education. He said all hands should be on deck to improve it. Bage, Chairman, Nasarawa State Council of Chiefs, spoke when the management of National Teachers’ Institute (NTI), Nasarawa branch, visited him yesterday. The emir, represented by Madakin Lafia, Alhaji Isiaka Dauda, underscored the roles of the institute in training and retraining of teachers for the development of the country. “I want to commend you for the visit and to urge you to continue to discharge your duties without fear or favour. “The activities of your institute, which involve training and retraining of teachers, will restore the lost glory of education,” he said. Bage urged the management of the institute to work towards tackling the challenges facing education. He assured them of his emirate council support to enable them carry out their activities effectively. The first class traditional ruler enjoined his subjects and other Nigerians to live in peace and tolerate one another irrespective of their affiliation. Mr. Abubakar Audu, the state coordinator of the institute, said the visit was to seek royal blessing and inform him of the activities of the institute in the state. “Our mission is to train and retrain teachers to ensure that quality teachers are produced,” he said. Audu said the institute would maintain standard in order to produce qualified teachers.
