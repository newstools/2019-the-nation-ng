Anssumane Fati has been officially included in Spain’s U-17 World Cup preliminary squad picked by David Gordo.
The list remains unofficial yet as the final version is expected to be presented in October. However, it’s highly likely that Ansu will travel to Brazil for his first major international event. At least, that’s one of the reasons for which the Spanish citizenship was obtained by the 16-year-old. Fati got his new passport last Friday. Currently, Barcelona are not delighted with the overall state of things as they see Ansu a valuable squad member. Now, everything points to the fact that the youngster will miss about seven games of the Catalans, including his would-be first El Clasico.
