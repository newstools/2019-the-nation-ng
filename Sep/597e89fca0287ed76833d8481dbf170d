I once read the story of a teacher who stood before a class full of students and showed them a hundred Dollar bill in mint condition. He asked if anyone wanted it and instantly, all hands were up, indicating that they wanted the money. He said “hold on a moment”, and he squeezed the money in his hand thereby making it pretty rough. He straightened out the bill and showed it to the students; it didn’t look as good as it did before. He asked them, “who wants this one hundred Dollar bill?” Once again, all the students indicated interest. “Just a minute” he said, as he dropped the money on the floor and stamped on it several times. The students watched wide-eyed, wondering what their teacher was up to. Finally, he picked up the money with the tip of his fingers as if trying to avoid dirtying his hands, and looked at the faces of his students. Then he asked again, “Now, who still wants this money?” For the third time, all hands were up. He smiled and said, “I squeezed the money and I stamped on it. It is no more as attractive as it used to be. Why do you still want it?” One of the students responded, “for as long as the money remains in one piece, its value doesn’t change irrespective of what you do to it”. The story above is very instructive. Some people have been through such difficult times that they no longer believe they are worth much.
