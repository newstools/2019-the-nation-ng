LOOKING for a creative outlook this season? Then you must know how to make use of your outfits and accessories to the fullest. One interesting thing about fashion items is that they have a way of bouncing back, when you repackage them nicely. Black dresses of various lengths and sizes are still one of the hottest items in your wardrobe. There are several features that make Victorian gowns unique. And one major reason why they standout is that they offer the wearer a freedom which no other dress can offer. They are always very comfortable to wear. Many women now grace social events, parties, wedding ceremonies, cocktails even church services wearing black dresses of different lengths. “This is the season of stylish black dresses and it is going to come in all sort of fabrics,” says Busola Isiaka, the petite woman behind Labussy Creations. The good thing about the black fabric is that it can be worn to any function, as office, informal or formal wears. There is nothing like a touch of the black dress to give you that sparkling effect. It is the queen of fabric at the moment. The LBD and gown are in a class of their own.  Whether as a top or gown, or as a spaghetti strap it’s now a must-have item among young and old fashionistas.
