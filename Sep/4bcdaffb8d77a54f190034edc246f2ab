Minister of State, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has congratulated the newly appointed Director General (DG) of Kogi All Progressives Congress (APC), Governorship Campaign Organisation, Sen. Smart Adeyemi, describing her appointment as well-deserved. Aliyu specifically tasked the DG to use his wealth of experience to galvanise the electorate to vote massively for the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Governor Yahaya Bello and his running mate, Comrade Edward Onoja in the November Kogi governorship race. She noted that with the political experience of Adeyemi, the coast is clear for APC’s victory, while calling on him to unite all aggrieved groups. The Minister, in a statement by her Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Austine Elemue, said Adeyemi will work assiduously towards the victory of APC in the state. “The Smart Adeyemi I know is a trustworthy character that can deliver in any assignment given to him. I sincerely believe that with his appointment as the Director General, of Kogi APC Governorship Campaign Organization, the camp of the enemy is in disarray. “However, I call on him to use his wealth of experience to galvanize all stakeholders of the party to ensure the victory of the party in the November governorship elections. I trust, we will not be disappointed in the choice of Adeyemi as the head of the campaign team”. She, however, called on other leaders of the party to team up with the campaign team to sell the candidacy of Governor Yahaya Bello and Comrade Edward Onoja.
