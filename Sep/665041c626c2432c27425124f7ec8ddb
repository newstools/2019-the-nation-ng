Barcelona’s 16-year-old forward Ansu Fati is eligible to join the Spanish national football team after he was given the country’s citizenship.
Having lived in Spain since 2009, Fati was born in Guinea-Bissau in 2002. Fati’s citizenship application was processed by the Spain’s Interior Ministry before the 2019 FIFA Under-17 World Cup squad deadline ends. The tournament will begin in Brazil on Oct. 26th. Fati, who became the youngest player in the Champions League, is expected to be called to the squad of the Spanish national team for the 2019 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. He also became the youngest scorer for Barcelona, making a great start in his career with two goals and one assist in four games so far.
