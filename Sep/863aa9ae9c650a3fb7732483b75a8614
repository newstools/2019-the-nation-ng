An APC Chieftain, Hon. Ayoola Lawal has commended the stance of the Federal government against the barbaric killings of Nigerians and other non-nationals in South Africa. In a statement made available to The Nation he said, “The barbaric killings of black non-nationals by South Africans seems to be becoming a norm and this cannot be tolerated further by any African nations again. “The recent attacks and killings of Nigerians and other African nationalities by the South Africans is highly condemnable and barbaric “I commend some of these popular African artistes, professional sportsmen and women for taking a stand against the recent spate of orchestrated attacks and killings in South Africa by condemning the violence”. He further called on the leadership of the African Union to urgently step up their game by sanctioning South Africa appropriately and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to book. He however berated the organizers of the World Economic Forum for still kicking off its event in spite of the killings and massacre of other Africans in South Africa.
