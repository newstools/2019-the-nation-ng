NO fewer than 150 physically challenged persons were empowered by one of the churches in Anambra State at the weekend as the beneficiaries cried for joy. It was during service at the Great Unchangeable Christ The King Church, Amenyi, Awka in Awka South local government area of Anambra State. In his sermon, entitled ‘Your hair will grow again’,  the founder of the Church, Prophet Onyedika Igali, told the congregation to be their brothers’ keepers by helping the poor and less privileged in the society. He said the decision of the church was not because it had money, but to follow the biblical injunction of rendering help to the helpless. Igali, said the church started the programme of feeding the down trodden since four years ago, which, according to him, had become an annual ritual. Some of the items distributed to the beneficiaries including the widows, the blind, the crippled, the deaf and dumb, among others, included cartons of noodles, rice, cooked food, wrappers, among other things. Most of them could not hold back tears of joy as they received their items from the man of God. 83-year-old Joseph Ilo and one of the blind men, Augustine Oku, who prayed for the progress of the church, told The Nation that they visit the church every September 1st for the gesture. Some of the widows, Oluchi Eze, 72-year-old Deborah Okoye, Ngozi Onwe, among others, said Igali had been a source of life to them in the past four years, adding that even before then, he had been good to the helpless.
