A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Fancy Jimoh Tiamiyu, has said that the appointment of Senator Smart Adeyemi, as the Director-General of the Kogi State APC Governorship Campaign Council, was a strategic. Tiamiyu described Adeyemi as a quintessential politician who has the experience and capacity to deliver. He said: “After the emergence of His Excellency, Governor Yahaya Bello, as the candidate of our great party, APC, and the nomination of the Chief of Staff to the governor, Edward Onoja, as his running mate, the appointment of Senator Smart Adeyemi, as the Director- General of the APC campaign council is another wise choice made to guarantee our party’s victory at the polls. We are satisfied with the decision of the party to have Senator Adeyemi as our campaign DG. We will give him all the needed support as he takes charge of the affairs and activities of the campaign council and gloriously leads the party to victory.” He added: “Senator Adeyemi’s experience as a veteran in the journalism profession, rising to hold the position of President, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) twice and a two-term senator, would certainly come handy in this very important assignment given to him by our party at this point in time. “That is why we are very much comfortable with his appointment as the campaign DG of the Bello-Onoja project, because we know he has got the vast experience, ability, connections and contacts to do a great job in rallying Kogi people to vote for the APC.”
