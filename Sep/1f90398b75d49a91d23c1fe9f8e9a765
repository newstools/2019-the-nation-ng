Lagos State Government on Tuesday presented a N10 million cheque to the relations of a Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) official, Folashade Arogundade, killed by a truck on May 25. Presenting the cheque to the husband, Mr. Tunde Babajide and her younger brother, Mr. Adekunle Arogundade, Special Adviser (SA) to the Governor on Transportation Mr. Oluwatoyin Fayinka said the donation was in fulfilment of the promises of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu when he paid a condolence visit to the bereaved family. He said although the state and especially LASTMA missed the services of the late officer, who was respected by her colleagues, the gift was to show the governor’s commitment to the welfare of civil servants. Fayinka urged the beneficiaries to utilise the money. The SA said a cheque of N5million was written to cater for the education of the deceased’s 18-month-old baby. He suggested that it should be deposited in an account to be jointly managed by the husband and a relation of the deceased. A cheque of N3million was handed over to the deceased’s relation, while N2million cheque was given to the husband. Permanent Secretary Ministry of Transportation Mr. Olawale Maroof Musa said the death of the LASTMA official was sad. He added that as part of his commitment to the welfare of civil servants, Governor Sanwo-Olu had led a high-powered delegation to the bereaved family to commiserate with them. Mr. Babajide thanked the governor for his magnanimity and LASTMA for the privilege his family has enjoyed. He prayed God to guide the governor aright in the task of building a safe and prosperous state. The deceased’s younger brother, Mr. Kunle Arogundade, who received a cheque of N3million on behalf of her family, thanked the governor for remembering the family in their period of grief. He prayed that such an unfortunate incident would not be recorded in the traffic agency again.
