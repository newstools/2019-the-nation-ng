 Ivorian football legend and former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba says his ultimate desire is to take the country’s football to back to its original place of pride. Ivory Coast according to him has a glorious football past and everything must be done to return the country to those days of glory. Drogba who revealed that Chelsea offered him a coaching role after his contract with the club ended said he turned down the offer because his passion was not in coaching but in leading the Ivorian football Federation with a view to taking the game in the country to the next level, noting that there are tested hands in the country who can effectively work with him to achieve the needed turn around. The former Shanghai Shenhua of China ace said “Chelsea offered me the chance to return to them as a coach. “But being a coach does not interest me. I am a leader, and my vision is bigger than just the simple role of being a coach “A coach has an impact on a club – but I want to have an impact on an entire nation. I could have stayed at Chelsea, but I think the real challenge is here. I want us to re-think football, with a nationwide vision, so we can develop the game here. The Ivory Coast has a glorious footballing past. “The funds are in place, together with talent and potential, but they are under-exploited. “There are some very competent people in the Ivory Coast who can work with me on this project, “he enthused. Drogba who made over 226 appearances for the Blues scoring 100 goals made 105 appearances for the Elephants of Cote d Ivoire scoring 65 goals.
