A group under the aegis of The Real Economy Sector Initiative (TRESI) has described as ineffective, the various interventions of the federal government in the area of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs). According to the body, the high attrition rate of small businesses due to the parlous state of the economy remains a serious cause of concern. At issue, according to the President of TRESI, Mrs Oyeyinka Banjo, who spoke on behalf of the group, during the inaugural conference held in njo, who stated this during the inaugural conference held in Lagos with the theme, ‘Addressing The Pain Points,’ is the fact that SME operators are hardly part of the decision making process when policy that affects the sector are being put forward. “A lot of the SME schemes are painfully inadequate and ineffective with a major factor being the absence of SME’s as key contributors in the process of design, development and implementation of these interventions,” she said, adding, that the SME Support and Advocacy Group seeks to promote the interests of entrepreneurs by influencing policies and actions that affect entrepreneurship, adding that it will engage the SME sector and stakeholders on those critical issues confronting SME’s. “We are to chart the path towards developing a highly productive, vibrant, robust and profitable segment in a consistent, predictable and sustainable manner.” According to Mr. Adegoke Afolami, Regional Manager, Bank of Industry (BOI), keeping proper books of business record is a vital aspect of BOI’s funding assistance to SMEs, stressing that BOI’s doors are open to assist SMEs who meet their funding criteria. “BOI is industrialisation focused and works to encourage production/ manufacturing. But we will take feedback to our office.”
