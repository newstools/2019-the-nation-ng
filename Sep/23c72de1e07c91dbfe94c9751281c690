One of the six workers of Action Against Hunger, an international humanitarian organisation, who was abducted by Boko Haram two months ago, has been killed. The insurgents uploaded a video online showing how the humanitarian worker was beheaded. Nigerian journalist Ahmad Salkida, via his verified Twitter handle, said the aid worker, a male was executed at a close range. Salkida said that he saw the video of the execution. Salkida added that ISWAP said it took the action because ‘the government deceived them’ following months of what is now known as secret negotiations between a team of intermediaries and unnamed officials. “#ISWAP has executed one of the six aid workers, working with the Action Against Hunger that was abducted two months ago in Borno,” Mr Salkida’s tweet reads. “One of the male aid workers was executed at close range in a short video clip seen by this reporter. The group said it took the action because “the government deceived them” following months of what is now known as secret negotiations between a team of intermediaries and unnamed officials. “ISWAP has also threatened to execute the other remaining staff of the International Non Governmental organization (ACF/AAH).
