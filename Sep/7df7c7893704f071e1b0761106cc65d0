Thieves have made away with a Toyota Camry with registration number Lagos LSR 355 AR, belonging to the Punch Abuja bureau chief, Adetayo Olalekan. The silver car was stolen from First Bank premises in Central District Business, Abuja on Thursday. Items taken away along with the vehicle include an iPad, hair clippers, house keys, four shirts, documents and N5,000 cash. Adetayo had parked in front of the Coomasie House branch to withdraw some money from the bank’s Automated Teller Machine when the car stolen. It was gathered that several cars belonging to customers had been stolen from the parking lot despite the presence of private security guards and policemen. A police officer attached to the bank disclosed that a car was similarly taken away by thieves a few days ago. Narrating his ordeal, Adetayo said: “I parked the car in front of the First Bank and I went to the ATM gallery to carry out a transaction but I observed that the machine was not functional, so I left. “But when I got to the park, my car was nowhere to be found. “I initially thought it was towed away by the Federal Road Safety Corps officials but checks at their car dump at Eagle Square indicate that they did not carry out a towing operation around the bank premises.” The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) police spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said the police were investigating the theft.
