Asisat Oshoala ended her three-match goal drought in the Spanish Primera Iberdrola this season with a brace in Barcelona’s 6-1 comeback thrashing of Atletico Madrid. Saturday’s encounter was the fourth for the three-time African Women’s Footballer of the Year in all competitions this season after her stunning pre-season form, netting eight goals in five games. After being denied by the woodwork this season, the Nigeria international scored in both halves to ensure Lluis Cortes’ ladies bounced back from a 1-1 draw at Rayo Vallecano in style. The 24-year-old broke her Primera Iberdrola duck this term with a calm finish as she scored the hosts’ fourth goal of the game on the brink of half time. Two minutes after the restart, the Super Falcons star grabbed her second of the match to make it 5-1 for Barcelona before being replaced by Claudia Pina in the 73rd minute. Her brace means she has now scored 21 goals in 19 matches in all competitions for Barcelona since she teamed up with the Spanish giants in January. The win helped Barcelona return to the summit of the log with seven points from three matches and they host Juventus in the Champions League Round of 32 reserve fixture on Wednesday.
