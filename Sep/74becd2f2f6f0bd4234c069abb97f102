According to reports, the victims are usually found strangled and gagged with a white handkerchief. Over the weekend, several women groups took to the streets of Port Harcourt to sensitise residents on alleged serial killers on the prowl in the city. The convener, Soibi Ibibo Jack said, “There is a serial killer on the loose in Rivers State. We want to go out and return home without fear. “We acknowledge the police for what they are doing, but we urge them to do more so that the killer is arrested, tried and made to face the full weight of the law.” Meanwhile, the Rivers State Police Command has advised young women to shun prostitution. The Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Administration, Chuks Enwonwu, while addressing protesters said, “In as much as societal values are disintegrating, we must go back to try to educate them (women) and discourage them from going into prostitution because that is how they fall victim to these crimes.”
