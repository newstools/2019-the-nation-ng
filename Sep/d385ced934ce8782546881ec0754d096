Mr Idris Wada, a Chief Prosecution witness, on Wednesday told a Dutse Grade I Area Court in Abuja that he lost four cows when an angry farmer attacked him. The police charged a farmer, Samson Aku, 67, who resides at Friendship street, SCC road in Bwari,with mischief by killing or maiming an animal. Being led in evidence by Prosecution Counsel, Mrs Idowu Ojo, Wada said that the four cows died from injuries they sustained when the defendant used his cutlass on them. He explained that the each of the dead cows, cost N180,000. ”I sold two surviving cows at a give away price of N70,000, so that I will loose our completely. “I received a call from my son that a farmer who’s farm was close to where he was herding had attacked six of my cows.   ”By the time I got there, four cows were dead and the remaining two were dying. I slaughter them immediately and called someone from the meat market to buy the meat,” he said.. During cross-examination, Mr Abubakar Suleiman, the defence counsel argued that his client was not responsible for the death of the cows since the witness and his son, slaughtered the cows themselves. He also said that the witness was not being truthful since his testimony was based on what his son told him on phone. Suleiman said that the witness, must at least, show the court an evidence that proved that the four cows that died were killed by the defendant. After listening to the testimonies, the presiding judge, Mr Suleiman Mohammed, adjourned further hearing in the matter until Sept. 16.  (NAN)
