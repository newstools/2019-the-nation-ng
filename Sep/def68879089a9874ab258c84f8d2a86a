Kogi Governor Yahaya Bello caused traffic gridlock at Gwagwalada, along the Abuja-Lokoja road on Wednesday when he sprayed money for about 10 minutes, Daily Trust has reported. The reported claimed Bello, who was caught in the ensuing gridlock, was heading to Lokoja in a long convoy. He reportedly slowed down at Madam Mercy Junction and brought out three bundles of N500 notes and threw them out at passers-by. After throwing the money, he was said to have wounded down the glass of the vehicle, flashing four fingers on both hands to indicate his confidence in being re-elected. Touts at the popular Wazobia Park hailed him, rushing to get their share of the windfall. Some pedestrians, petty traders and even Okada riders abandoned their motorcycles and scrambled for the money. Bello, who won the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is seeking a second term in the election slated for November 16.
