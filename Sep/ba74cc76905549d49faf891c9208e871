The Enugu State government has bought 360 patrol vehicles — 260 Sienna buses and 100 Hilux vans — to be distributed to security agencies, vigilance groups and forest guards. Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi on Wednesday said the 260 buses would be given to watch groups and forest guards; the Hilux vans would go to the Army, Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Ugwuanyi hinted that the government had placed order for patrol motorcycles and bicycles. He noted that the move would strengthen security in the state and ensure that the 478 autonomous communities were secured. The governor said the government was consulting with security experts to implement a laudable forest guard security outfit. “Being the first state in the country to have forest guards, we do not want to make mistakes. That is why we are consulting security experts at every stage,” he added. The governor said the security architecture of the state would be such that hunters would be empowered with mechanical mobility. He added that his administration would to set up a security trust fund to be managed by experts. The fund would be modelled after that of Lagos State, Ugwuanyi said.
