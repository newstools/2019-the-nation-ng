MOURNING Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr has revealed that his late mum fought opposing fans for her five sons while playing football, describing her as a football mum. Madam Elisabeth Rohr passed on on Thursday at the ripe age of 94. Rohr who shared her mother’s best moment after her demise yesterday stated that she followed his five sons wherever they played, while their father was the coach. He said the love the mother showed toward her sons was unquantifiable. “She was a football mum who followed her five sons wherever they played matches and my dad as a coach. One day she was fighting an opposition fan for insulting one of my brothers,” he added. The news of Rohr’s mother demise was confirmed via the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) twitter handle @Thenff on Thursday. It reads: We commiserate with @NGSuperEagles Head coach, Mr. Gernot Rohr who just lost his mother, Madam Elisabeth Rohr. She was 97. May her soul rest in peace. The news would come as a shock to the German tactician, who helped Nigeria to claim a bronze medal at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Rohr recently guided the senior national team to a pulsating 2-2 draw against Ukraine in Tuesday’s international friendly game at the Dnipro Arena.
