Gunmen disrupted the Kogi People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship primary that was ongoing at the Lokoja Confluence Stadium in the early hours of Wednesday. The disruption ended the exercise at about 1:45am. Votes in eight out of the 10 ballot balloxes had been counted and sorted before the  commotion ensued. Before the disruption, heavy windstorm and rain had threatened to bring the exercise to an end. Aspirants, delegates and others scampered for safety. The number of those that sustained injury was yet to be ascertained as at the time of filing this report. The chairman of the Electoral Committee  and Adamawa Governor Ahmadu Fintiri was among those who escaped unhurt.
