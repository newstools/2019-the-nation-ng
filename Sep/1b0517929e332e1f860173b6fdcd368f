Mustapha Salihu, claimed on Friday that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, was deceived by con men into believing that there was an INEC server used to transmit the results of the election. According to Salihu, it is clear that there was no such server recognised by law anywhere and so could not have been used for the election. He spoke to reporters in Abuja at the end of a meeting of stakeholders of the party from Adamawa State. He argued that those who told the former Vice President of the existence of a server succeeded in scamming him, stressing that even though his lawyers did a good job trying to present his case, they failed to establish a prima facie case. “Some people robbed them (PDP), took their money, telling them there was INEC server somewhere when that was not true,” he said. “Even though their lawyers did a good job trying to present their case, it was dismissed because there was no substance.” Salihu described the Presidential Election Petition tribunal’s verdict on Atiku’s suit as a victory for Nigeria and the Nigerian people and not for APC alone. He added: “We have now done away with the distractions and this government is going to deliver the dividends of democracy and the next level is assured. The outcome of the tribunal is something that was expected. “All the grounds canvassed by the opposition are frivolous because you cannot say that an army general who served as a commanding officer, Head of State, Minister and President of Federal Republic of Nigeria for four years does not have credentials.”
