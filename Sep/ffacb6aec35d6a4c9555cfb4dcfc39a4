Under its newly appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Monsurat Adeleke, the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency (LSACA) has promised to continue to extend HIV intervention outreaches to all communities in the state, including the hard-to-reach riverine areas. Addressing the media during one of its outreaches, the CEO said the current outreach is targeting 6,000 Lagosians for HIV testing services (HTS) at two different locations within Lagos Island Local Government Area, Amuwo-Odofin LGA and Ajeromi LGA. She said it is important to know one’s status because HIV is no longer a death sentence provided one adheres strictly to medications. “In lie with the agency vision of mitigating the effect on those infected and affected by the scourge, we have mounted effective campaign for the reduction of HIV prevalence in Lagos State through behavioural change communication. Similarly, in recognition of the global trend in HIV intervention, which is to eliminate new infections, discrimination and AIDS-related deaths, the agency has scaled up community outreach campaign of HIV testing services for early detection and treatment in order to achieve the virus eradication in Lagos State by 2030. Using the UN 90-90-90 initiative, which means 90 per cent of the people must know their HIV status, 90 per cent of those that know their status must have access to anti-retroviral treatment, 90 per cent of those on treatment must have suppressed their viral load and would not be able to infect others,” she said. Dr. Adeleke further clarified that access of HIV testing services will allow individuals to know their status early and take appropriate steps to prevent transmission to other people. It also affords an individual the opportunity to take necessary steps through lifestyle modifications and change in health-seeking behaviour.
