Former Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger has described Barcelona forward Lionel Messi as a complete player who though constantly desires to score but recognises when to allow others do the finishing. Wenger who has been out of job since quitting Arsenal last year after 22 years at the Emirates, was reacting to misunderstanding between Liverpool duo of Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah after their 3-0 defeat of Burnley last weekend. Salah was involved in a spat with team-mate Sadio Mane in the Reds’ 3-0 win at Burnley, with the Senegal forward furious at his Egyptian team-mate for failing to pass the ball to him to apply a simple tap-in late on. Mane was substituted moments later and could not hide his anger over the incident on the touchline as he departed the field. Wenger while describing the two feuding players as great players nonetheless criticised Salah for being too selfish in attack. The former AS Monaco handler said though the Egypt international has the abilities of Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, he unlike Messi, insists on doing the finishing at all times. ‘He [Salah] has similarities with Messi,’ Wenger told beIN Sports. ‘He must find the consistency of Messi. ‘I find he’s a good finisher but Messi has the complete thing, he gives the final ball as well. ‘Salah is a bit obsessed with finishing himself. ‘That’s a dimension he’ll get certainly, when he grows a little bit older, to find the moment when you have to give the ball and when you have to finish. ‘But I like him very much, he has huge potential. Mane as well,” he submitted Liverpool who have won all their premier league matches played so far in the new season will next host Newcastle in a tie they have been tipped to win to make it five wins in five matches.
