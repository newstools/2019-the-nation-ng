An Ikeja High Court on Thursday sentenced one Lawrence Maduagwu to 10 years imprisonment for defrauding a Chinese company of $179,000. Justice Mojisola Dada convicted Maduagwu of a two-count charge bordering on stealing and obtaining by false pretence brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The convict was arraigned on February 28, 2018, charged with stealing and obtaining by false pretence to the tune of $179,000.00. Maduagwu was introduced to the complainant, PMC Industry Limited, through its Nigerian representative, Ohio Ileogben, as a businessman who deals in calcium chloride chemicals. He, however, failed to pay for the 500 metric tonnes of calcium powder valued at the sum of $179,000, after taking delivery of the items and efforts to get him pay for the goods were unsuccessful. In the course of the trial, the prosecution counsel, S.O. Daji, called five witnesses and tendered several exhibits that were admitted in evidence by the court. The defendant, however, testified for himself and also called two other witnesses. During the sitting on June 19, 2019, parties adopted their final written addresses respectively. Delivering her judgement yesterday, Justice Dada convicted and sentenced the defendant to seven years imprisonment on count one and three years on count two. Both sentences are to run concurrently from the date of his remand, February 28, 2018 by the court. The Judge also ordered that the convict make full restitution of $179,000 which the EFCC must employ all legal means to ensure compliance.
