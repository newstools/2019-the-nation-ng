Sixty per cent of the participants in the Smart Electrical Engineering Training organised by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) have secured employment, its Executive Secretary, Simbi Kesiye Wabote, has said. Four of the 50 engineers secured international placements with BIC Electric and now work in Europe, while other participants got employment in Nigeria with AOS Orwell, Daystar Power Group, Eauxwell, Jubaili Bros and PNN amongst others, he added. The six-month classroom and on-the-job training was conducted at the Lagos Energy Academy (LEA) by AOS Orwell, an oil and gas servicing company for NCDMB. The second batch of 50 engineers would commence their training in September at the same location. The beneficiaries, like all other trainees of NCDMB, were selected from the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Joint Qualification System (NOGICJQS) and underwent qualifying tests and interviews. Wabote, at the certificate presentation held in Lagos, commended AOS Orwell for the success recorded with the Smart Electrical Engineering Training. He described it as a validation of the Boardâ€™s new model for human capacity building, which emphasises the delivery of training with a line of sight to employment opportunities. He stated that the Board had adopted a 60-20-20 model for human capital development, whereby 60 percent of the training expenditure and efforts gets devoted to programmes that guarantee jobs for the participants.
