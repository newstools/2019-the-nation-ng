Using our community policing strategies we were able to trace, track and arrest one person by name Salisu Idris at mijinbir town,where he went to take cover at the local government area,” he said. Responding to inquiries from reporters, the suspect confessed that he was hired on a promise of N200, 000 to carry out the act. Idris, a mobile phone seller, said he wanted to use the money to enroll into the Yusuf Maitama Sule University, Kano. “A friend of mine asked me to accompany him to the house. He asked me to come along with him that at the end of the operation he will give me N200, 000. We came around 2pm.
