President, Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Cooperative Multipurpose Society Mr. Asuni Olamiji has urged Nigerians to start preparing for their retirement right from the day of appointment. Addressing members of the society at its 2018 Annual General Meeting held at the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre said many retirees found themselves in tight corners when it becomes obvious that they were retiring from private or public service.According to him, this affected the conduct of cooperative societies to deliver on its core mandate to its members, noting that investment and loan disbursement were affected. “I am using this medium to appeal to members to subscribe for share capital which are meant for trading activities. Our savings are for granting loans and not for other purpose.”
