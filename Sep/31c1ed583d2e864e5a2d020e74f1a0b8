Tragedy on Wednesday struck in Kano when unidentified arsonists reportedly set ablaze a family of three, who were burnt to death. It was gathered that the arsonists locked up the gate of the house and set ablaze the building. An eyewitness said the incident occurred in the early hours at Gayawa quarters in Ungogo Local Government. The source told reporters that efforts by neighbours to rescue the family failed, as the fire raged throughout the night. Kano State Fire Service spokesman Sa’idu Ibrahim said they received a distress call at about 3:57am from Mr.  Mudassir Abdullahi, who alerted them to the inferno. “Upon arrival around 4:08am, we broke the door and found that three members of the family, the husband, 50-year-old Aminu Bala, his wife, 30-year-old Rukayya Aminu and their two-year-old daughter, Aisha Aminu, had suffered high degree of injuries. “Our men rushed them to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, Kano where a doctor certified them dead,” he said. Police spokesman DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident, said Commissioner Ahmed Iliyasu has ordered investigation.
