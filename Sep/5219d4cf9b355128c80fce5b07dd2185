Works and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola has alerted the public to a fake Facebook account opened in his name, and warned people against falling prey to the antics of the scammers behind it. Fashola, in a statement by Mr Hakeen Bello, his special adviser on Communications, said the fake account, which had his name and picture, was opened by dupes and scammers. The statement, made available to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), yesterday in Abuja, said “the minister has, on several occasions in the past, disclaimed such fake accounts,” and reiterated that Fashola’s verified Facebook account remained @BABATUNDEFASHOLA. It said the latest fake account set up in the former Lagos State governor’s name claimed that the Federal Government was giving out N700,000 to youths and young adults to enable them pay school fees, set up businesses and invest in businesses, among others. Part of the publication written in very poor English by the scammers, read: “All the Nigeria Citozings of All the and Local Government in Nigeria Are Beneficiary of the Federal Government Money Enpwoerment to Empower the Youth to Pay There School. “Adult to do Business Etc. Contact Number 08035339533). Good News…To All Nigeria Youth and Adult… Federal Government is Giving Out N700,000 Free Cash Transfer To All To Empower the Youth Further Their Educations, Open Good Business and Learn Good Works. “Call Mr Adebayo Kola, the Federal Government Cashier on 09035339533. All the Nigerian Citizens of All the States and Local Governments …” Bello said. Bello quoted the minister as describing the activities of the scammers as “unfortunate”, wondering why people still fall prey to the scammers “in spite of repeated warnings and disclaimers.” The statement said the warning became necessary following increasing activities of the scammers. It advised the public to always clarify with the appropriate agencies of government before engaging in any dealing with people purportedly working for them.
