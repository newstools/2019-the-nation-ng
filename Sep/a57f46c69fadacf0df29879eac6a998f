There was a big fight between Mercy and Tacha on Friday at the Big brother house, similar to what could be obtainable in a wrestling ring. The heated argument between the two has attracted several reactions from fans and followers of the show. Other housemates attempted to broker peace, but the angered Tacha and Mercy were hearing none of it, with Tacha yanking off Mercy’s hair which she was swinging in her face. The argument between the two has to do with Tacha’s alleged body odour and after the housemates argued, Tacha could be clearly seen applying body spray. There are already insinuations that the duo may be sanctioned for their actions. Wowww…I swear no know say the fight SERIOUS like this ooo, mercy and Tacha push themselves sha Frodd Omashola and mike are CLOWNS by d way #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/mHlTMBoNby — Okunola Seun (@draliconpoint) September 27, 2019
