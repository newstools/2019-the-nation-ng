A suspected ritual killer, Tunde Tayo has been apprehended by the Niger State Police Command after a shallow grave with a headless body was discovered close to his house. Tunde who lives in Ungwan Roka in Maitumbi, a suburb in Bosso Local Government Area of the state was alleged to have killed 25-year-old Abdullahi Sale. Tunde confessed to the crime when he was paraded on Saturday saying that he lured Sale to his uncompleted building in Ungwan Roka, where he carried out the crime. “I beheaded and removed Sale’s intestine for ritual purposes. I even buried him in a shallow grave near my house.” The father of five children said that he committed the crime due to the inconsistency for him to get money adding that his profession as a Welder did not bring him much income to maintain his family. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, disclosed that the suspect was apprehended by police operatives attached to the Maitumbi Division based on reports of passers-by and neighbours who sighted the newly dug grave close to his house. Abubakar said that when the Victim’s body was exhumed, it was discovered that the head had been removed adding that upon interrogation of everyone who had houses in the area, the Suspect owned up and confessed to the crime. He said that investigation is still ongoing and the suspect would be charged to court after the investigations.
