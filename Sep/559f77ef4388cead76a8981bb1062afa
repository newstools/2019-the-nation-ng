Experts have advocated the need for gender balance in the marketing communication industry. They spoke at the at the Women in Marketing and Communications Conference/Awards (WIMCA) themed ‘’Better the balance in the Brands and Marketing Communications Industry” held at Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos. The convener, Joshua Ajayi, said: “The theme is a reminder to us that the race is on for gender-balanced boardrooms, government, workforces, media coverage and income and wealth distribution among others. Interestingly, the industry, the nation, the continent and the world generally have in the few couple of years recorded history-defining achievements in gender balance, though, there is more to be done.” Wema Bank Managing Director Ademola Adebise, represented by the bank’s Chief Finance Officer, Tunde Mabawonku, said women in marketing and communications, were great contributors in the industry. He therefore urged them to support themselves, focused on their goals in the quest to ensure that many of them get to the top in their career and to the boardroom. Also, MultiChoice Chief Executive Officer John Ugbe explained that his organisation has more women who have risen to the top in their career. He urged other organisations to deploy creative ways in addressing female-related challenges. Also,  the Group Chief, Sustainability and Governance, Dangote Industries Limited, Dr  Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien, who spoke on ‘Better the balance in the workplace: equity or equality?’said  women in business were dedicated and that for them to find the way to the top, they should “define and understand the problem, align with a global movement”. She advised women to network, support each other and learn to compete favourably with men. The event was chaired by SO&U Group Managing DirectorUdeme Ufot. The highlight of the event was the presentation of awards to outstanding women in marketing communications.
