FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo has said the economic development of the nation depended on the constructive contribution of the engineering sector. Obasanjo, who spoke during a programme organised by the Nigeria Academy of Engineering in Lagos, said without engineering there, cannot be any meaningful development. He said economic growth is achieved when efforts are made to develop infrastructure such as roads, railways among others. He said  for the country to achieve sustainable economic development, there  was  need for more engagement of indigenous engineers in the provision of infrastructural facilities. He said the only professionals that have the capacity to apply the knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences, gained by study and experience in the provision of social amenities are the engineers. The former president called for the re-engineering of the country’s engineers for optimum economic growth and development. According to him, the purpose of engineering education is to learn how to impart knowledge of the engineering content which can solve societal problems in a sustainable way for the development of a nation. Deliering the lecture titled: Engineering Education for sustainable in Nigeria, Prof Funso Falade of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Lagos,  said engineers are supposed to conceive, design, implement, operate and maintain individual, corporate and government projects using relevant codes and standards that take into consideration the local environment. He said local engineers have fared well on government projects, because foreigners are used instead of local experts. According to him, local engineers have not been challenged because of low level of patronage.
