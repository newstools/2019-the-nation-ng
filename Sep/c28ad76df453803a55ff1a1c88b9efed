It led on profitability with pre-tax profit and net profit after tax of N115.8 billion and N99.13 billion respectively. Zenith Bank, Nigeria’s second most capitalised bank, maintains its lead as the bank with the highest gross earnings, raking N331.6 billion within the first six months of this year. Access Bank which consummated a landmark merger recently, took major leaps to become the second on the top-line ranking and third on profit-size chart. Stanbic IBTC’s pre-tax profit margin dropped from 44.42 per cent to 38.04 per cent, depressing the actual pre-tax profit from N50.73 billion to N44.65 per cent.

Net profit rose from N81.74 billion in first half 2018 to N88.88 billion in first half 2019. With this, earnings per share improved by 9.0 per cent from N2.60 to N2.83.

Profit before tax jumped by 61.6 per cent from N45.8 billion to N74.1 billion while profit after tax leapt by 59 per cent from N39.6 billion to N63 billion. Earnings per share thus improved from N1.38 to N1.94. These results have clearly shown that notwithstanding the vagaries and undulating movement of stock prices in the equities market, considerable confidence of Return On Investment still exists thus giving shrewd investors the clout to continue to play on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).
