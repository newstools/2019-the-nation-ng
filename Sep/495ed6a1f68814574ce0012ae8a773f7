THE Minister of Communications, Dr Ibrahim Pantami has said the contribution of the information communication technology (ICT) may displace that of the oil and gas sector in two years’ time if the tempo of its growth is sustained. He said going by the figures released recently by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) that ICT was adding 13.8 per cent to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), the figure is mostly likely to outpace that of oil and gas sector. Pantanmi spoke on Monday at the ongoing session of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU Telecom World 2019) in Budapest, Hungary. Pantami said the government wants to sustain the steady growth of ICT in the country hence the need to attend events like these, which will enable delegates network and get the best ideas “and when we return home we put all of them to work towards the development of our country”. Pantanmi commended the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for successfully putting together the country’s participation and urged the delegates “to maximise the opportunity provided by the attendance by thinking global and acting local’’. “I want to thank the NCC for organising the Nigeria’s participation to this very important event. The effort is highly commendable. We hope the tempo will be sustained. “I’ve been saying it and I’ll repeat it again that the future of the world is in the ICT. It is a privilege to be part and parcel of this sector and at the same time to be with the stakeholders of the ICT in Nigeria,” he said.
