AUTHORITIES at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday lifted suspension placed on trading on the shares of Niger Insurance Plc and Guinea Insurance Plc after the two insurers submitted their audited report and accounts. The NSE had in July 2019 suspended trading on the two insurance companies alongside nine other companies for failing to adhere to best corporate governance and extant post-listing requirements that make it mandatory for quoted companies to submit their financial statements within stipulated timelines. Post-listing rules at the NSE require quoted companies to submit their audited earnings reports, not later than 90 calendar days after the expiration of the period. The rules also require quoted companies to submit interim report not later than 30 calendar days after the end of the relevant period. Not less than 83 per cent of quoted companies use the 12-month Gregorian calendar year as their business year. The business year thus terminates on December 31. While March 31 is usually the deadline for submission of annual report for companies with Gregorian calendar business year, the deadline for the quarterly report is a month after the quarter. The NSE stated that Niger Insurance and Guinea Insurance have submitted their audited financial statements, which necessitated lifting of the trading suspension yesterday, Wednesday September 25, 109.
