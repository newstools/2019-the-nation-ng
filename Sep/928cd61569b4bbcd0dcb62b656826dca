GUNMEN at the weekend abducted four travellers, who rushed to an accident scene in Elele, Rivers State, to rescue the victims. It was learnt that victims of the accident were persons from Bayelsa State, who were returning from a traditional wedding in Mbaise, Imo State. They were reportedly travelling on a Toyota Sienna car when the vehicle crashed into another. A popular Ijaw youth and social media activist Prince Elayo Ekete and the driver of the Sienna car were said to have died on the spot. Eyewitnesses travelling  from Bayelsa were said to have rushed to the scene to rescue the victims when kidnappers seized them and took them away. Another source said the kidnapped victims were abducted after they had successfully rushed other victims of the accident to a hospital. A source, who witnessed the incidents, said, “The wedding was attended by most social media activists from Bayelsa across political party lines. Ekete and seven others were returning from the occasion and they got to Elele when their vehicle had a head-on collision. “Ekete and the driver died on the spot. But five others were rushed to a hospital in the area. But four of the rescuers were abducted by kidnappers. “The kidnappers went to the accident scene, recovered personal effects of some of the victims and called one of the rescuers asking him to come to a particular place to collect them. When they got there, the gunmen seized them”. One of the injured victims of the accident, Dina Adiva, confirmed that some persons, who came to rescue them were kidnapped by unknown gunmen and prayed for their freedom.
