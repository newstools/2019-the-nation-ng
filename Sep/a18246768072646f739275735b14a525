There was confusion in Abuja over whether members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shi’ites actually held their much -talked about Ashura procession in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). While some people who spoke with THE NATION said members of the group were not sighted on the streets of Abuja, others said the mourning procession took place very early in the morning. A top member of the Shi’ites group, Abdullahi Musa, on his part said the procession started in Wuse market and ended around Berger from 8:00am to 8:30am. Musa told our reporter that the procession was peaceful and well organised. His words: “We quickly did the procession starting from Wuse market at about 8:00am to 8:30am through to Berger roundabout. “We are not many like other years. Police did not stop or disturb us. The procession was peaceful and well organised.” Unlike some other states, Abuja was calm with people going about their normal businesses without fear from any quarter. Security operatives, especially the police were also sighted in major areas in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). They were heavily armed and apparently ready to forestall any breakdown of law and order. Initially, residents were afraid that the procession could result into violence but they were surprised that no such thing occurred. The police were more on ground at the Federal Secretariat. Findings also revealed that armed police were deployed to guard major roads leading into Abuja and its environs to prevent crisis. IMN had on Monday petitioned the Human Rights Commission, United Nations and the European Union over Tuesday’s Ashura procession which it claimed that the police were preparing to disrupt and attack it members.
