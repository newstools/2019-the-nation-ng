THE Lagos State Government has reassured residents that measures are already in place to address the challenges posed by incessant rainfall. Lagosians have been witnessing heavy downpours in the last few days. Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, who inspected some of the major drainage systems, said residents should rest assured that irrespective of the volume of the rainfall, it would flow through the drains to discharge into the various channels. The commissioner warned against indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains as well as erecting structures on drainages lines and alignments. This, he said, could aggravate flooding. He reminded the people of the Executive Order signed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on zero tolerance for indiscriminate dumping of refuse. According to him, while relevant agencies are on red alert for any unforeseen incident, residents must be vigilant and promptly report cases of indiscriminate dumping of refuse into drainage channels and unauthorized places as well as other incidents of drainage blockage to the relevant agencies. Bello advised Lagosians to be safety conscious during this period, urging them to take some safety measures such as avoid going out during the rains except when absolutely necessary and be careful when driving. He stressed that Lagosians residing along flood plains and low-lands should be at alert and be ready to move for safety whenever the need arises.
