A past District Governor, Rotary International, District 9110 Nigeria, Prince Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi, a former Minister of Health, has called on privileged Nigerians to partner the Sir Kessington Adebukunola Adebutu Foundation (KAAF) to bring succour to the masses. He made this  call at the inauguration of a block of two classrooms at  the Ikeja Junior High School, Ikeja, GRA, sponsored by Sir Kessington Adebukunola Adebutu on behalf of the Rotary Club of Ikeja. Adebutu, represented by Rotarian Kola Oyefeso, donated N10 million. The project was first suggested during the 2018/2019 Rotary Year tenure but was eventually completed by  the current  administration of Rotarian Olumuyiwa Fagbola  with  support of the members of the board. In their remarks at the event, the Permanent Secretary, Lagos Ministry of Education, Mrs Abosede Adelaja and  Prince Adelusi-Adeluyi, praised Sir Adebutu for his philanthropic gestures. Mrs Adelaja thanked the philanthropist and called for the judicious use of the classrooms. She also called for more of such gestures. On his part, District Governor, 9110 Rotary International, Rotarian Dr Jide Akeredolu, reiterated the continued need to  assist Rotary International in its drive to make life very meaningful for humanity in general.
