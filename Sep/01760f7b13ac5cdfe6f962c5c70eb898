 Super Eagles defender Semi Ajayi sang victory song on Saturday as West Brom beat homers Queens Park Rangers 0-2 in the English Championship. The Nigeria international was in action for full 90 minutes doing the clearing job to ensure that Park Rangers never recovered playing at home in front of their vociferous fans notwithstanding. Homeboy and fellow defender Nathan Ferguson shot West Brom into the lead in the 53rd minute of the match with Matheus Pereira doubling the lead just with six minutes to the end of the match. The victory takes West Brom’s unbeaten run to nine in a row. On duty for Queens Park Rangers were two players of Nigerian origin Ebere Eze and Bright Osayi-Samuel who played for 70 and 20 minutes respectively and put in their best which unfortunately could not stop Ajayi and teammates from running away with vital away win. Ajayi has been named in Coach Gernot Rohr’s team to face the Samba Boys of Brazil in an international friendly October 10.
