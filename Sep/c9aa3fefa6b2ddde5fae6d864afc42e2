Former Managing Director  UACN Mr. Hakeem Ogunniran has  stressed the need to re-engineer home designs and construction to achieve maximum efficiency. He said the trend in urban dwelling in leading cities across the globe since 2011 is that “the era of mac-mansion (big structures) is gone” as a result of limited land supply and the spiraling construction costs. He spoke at the ground-breaking ceremony of Fiona Lawton Apartments, an upscale estate in Lekki, over the weekend. He said: “The reality on ground has made it necessary  to optimise living and maintenance costs and  this is reflected in the significant reduction in the average sizes of dwelling apartments in such cities as New York (39 square meters) London (46 square meters) Paris (36 square meters) and Hong Kong (15square meters) in the last few years.” Ogunniran, who is the Managing Director of  Eximia Realty Company Limited, said his objective is to create a unique and innovative platform to deliver real estate solutions by addressing emerging living models tailored to contemporary urban lifestyles. On what informed his market segmentation, Ogunniran said: “Our deduction from empirical analysis is that there is a reasonably significant market for micro apartments designed to suit the Nigerian lifestyle preferences in Lagos and a few other cities. We are set to tap into that opportunity through our ‘uniquely crafted living spaces’ based on the concepts of ‘Compact, Comfortable and Convenient Dwelling.’’
