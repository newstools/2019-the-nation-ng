The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum has condemned the invasion of the Abuja residence of Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi. In a statement on Sunday by the Chairman and Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, the forum described the raid as an attack on democracy. “It is assault on the sensibility and integrity of Ebonyi people, and an affront on their fundamental rights, the forum of PDP governors, millions of PDP members and all Nigerians,” Dickson said. The governors said the raid was already generating anger, and so called on the Inspector General of Police (IG), Idris Adamu, to investigate it. According to the forum, the investigation was important since the invaders were alleged to be security operatives, while the police denied such an operation. The statement reads: “We are worried that the police authorities have denied the foreknowledge of the operation. The fact that the police high command, including the Office of the Inspector General of Police, have distanced themselves from the invasion makes it a suspicious operation. “We, therefore, urge the IG to probe the raid. This should be carried out immediately to unveil the circumstances and people behind the action.” The governors also called on the Federal Government to intensify efforts to ensure protection of lives and property.
