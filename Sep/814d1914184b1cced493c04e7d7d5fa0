Uwajumogu advised President Muhammadu Buhari to integrate the returnees into his administration’s Social Investment Scheme to get them back on their feet soonest. “I am also appealing to governors of Southeast states to immediately put a committee in place to help ameliorate the trauma of returnees from the zone as well,” he said.
