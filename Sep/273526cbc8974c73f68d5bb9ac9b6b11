Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Monday night won the men’s coach of the year at the Best FIFA Football Awards in Milan. Klopp  was one of three Premier League bosses to be nominated for the award, alongside Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola and Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino. Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotsports in the UEFA Champions League final in June and came second in the Premier League in 2018/2019. The Reds have also won all six league matches at the start of 2019/2020. “It is great, nobody expected this 20, 10, five, four years ago that I would be standing here,” Klopp said upon receiving his award. “We know what an incredible job you Mauricio Pochettino did and what Pep did. I have to say thank you to my outstanding club Liverpool FC. “To the owners thank you, they gave me an incredible team. I have to thank my team – as a coach you can only be as good as your team is. I’m really proud of being manager of such an incredible bunch of players. “This is an individual prize, I don’t 100% understand individual prizes, I’m here for a lot of people.” BBCSports
