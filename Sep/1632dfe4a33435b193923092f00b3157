An Igbo socio-cultural group,  Nzuko Umunna, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to order an enquiry into the invasion of the Abuja residence of Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State in the early hours of Monday, September 2. A statement by its Coordinator, Joe Odumuko, and General Secretary, Obinna Mbanefo, said the invasion happened, coming barely 24 hours after the Southeast Governors Forum banned herders from moving around with AK-47 and machetes and directed security agencies to enforce the order. The statement said the purpose of the act is to intimidate, overawe and silence Umahi, who is also the Chairman of the Southeast Governors’ Forum (SEGF), and his colleagues and prevent them from discharging their mandate of speaking boldly on behalf of the people of the Southeast. It reads in part: “We note that the invaders were clearly identified as security operatives who subjected occupants of the premises and police officers on duty to intolerable harassment and intimidation before thoroughly ransacking the premises. “It is noteworthy that this reckless and illegal act was carried out without a search warrant, again portraying Nigeria as a country that has little or no respect for the rule of law. “The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from the modus operandi of the operatives is that they had a singular mission to plant incriminating evidence in the property towards framing trumped-up charges against Governor Umahi.” The group urged the perpetrators to desist from such acts, to avoid throwing the country into a needless crisis. It said no amount of arm-twisting, trumped up charges or intimidation will make the Southeast to shirk its resolve to ensure safety of lives and property in the zone. It also urged the Southeast Governors Forum to remain resolute and unfazed.
