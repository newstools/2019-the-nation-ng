President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday met with the President and members of the Council of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting started at the President’s office in the State House around 11.30am. Recall that the President of the NSE, Engr. Adekunle Mokuolu, FNSE had joined the Federal Government delegation to Japan for the recently concluded 2019 edition of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7). President Buhari had in March this year, signed into law the Engineers Registration Amendment Act, 2019, which vested the constitutional right to the Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) to regulate engineering practice in the country. The Council had also backed President Buhari’s signing of Executive Order 5 last year to improve local content in public procurement with science, engineering and technology components. Supporting the order, Engr. Mokuolu, had declared “Those who doubt the capacity of local engineers is like questioning the capacity of a woman to get pregnant.” The meeting with the President on Wednesday was still in progress at the time of filing this report.
