Ahead of the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, the Election Institute (TEI) and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have embarked on a ‘training the trainers’ programme on election security. The participants were drawn from across the 21 LGAs of the state, including officers of the Nigeria Police, the Army, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and other paramilitary forces. Speaking at the opening of the training session for personnel from Kogi West, in the capital, Lokoja, the institute’s Director, Dr Sa’ad Idris, who was represented by his deputy, Victoria Ettah-Messi, noted that the INEC is not by law empowered to make arrests. She explained that it is the police in collaboration with other security agencies, that is charged with maintaining law and order, on election day. “We cannot conduct an election in an atmosphere that is not peaceful or conducive, but INEC is not charged with keeping the security, and that is why we need you during the conduct of the election, as you will help us conduct free and fair election,” she explained. She called on the participants to do their best in impacting what they have gained at the sessions on others back in their various areas of operation, saying that by so doing, will the outcome of the election be better impacted. She commended the European Centre for Electoral Services (ECES), for their efforts in promoting electoral success in Nigeria, noting that the gesture has continued to advance the process in the country.
