AT Just 18 years and 14 days old, Nigeria- born Bukayo Saka became the youngest player to score a goal for Arsenal in Europe since October 2008 when Aaron Ramsey (17years 300day) netted against Fenerbahce. Saka shone as the Gunners began their Europa League campaign with an impressive 3-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Unai Emery made seven changes from the weekendâ€™s disappointing draw at Watford with youngsters Saka, Joe Willock and Emile Smith-Rowe given a chance to impress. Willock opened the scoring in the 38th minute then Saka doubled the advantage with a fine finish in the 85th minute before laying on a late third for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang three minutes later.
