A customary court in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, has dissolved a marriage after listening to the plea of a policewoman who accused her husband of planning to use her for money ritual. Sgt. Wuraola Babalola petitioned a Mapo Customary Court in the city, seeking the dissolution of her marriage of 14 years to Oladimeji. The petitioner alleged that Oladimeji used different kinds of charms whenever he wanted to sleep with her, News Agency of Nigeria reports. She also said Oladimeji has turned her into his punching bag. “At any slightest opportunity, he strips me and prevents my relatives from seeing me. He puts charms in my private part whenever he wants to sleep with me. He also surrounds my plate of food with charms, saying he uses it to protect me. “He has also buried different kinds of charms in the house chanting my name. My first child saw him do that. I have evidence of all the charms and how he maltreats me on my cell phone.” Oladimeji was not in court to answer to the allegations. The bailiff informed the court that he had on several occasions served hearing notices on Oladimeji, who lives in Oluyole Estate in Ibadan. After listening to the testimony of the petitioner, Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court, dissolved the marriage, on grounds of threat to life. He granted custody of the three children to the petitioner and ordered the respondent to pay N15,000 as the monthly feeding allowance. The arbitrator ordered the clerk of the court to ensure that a copy of the judgment is sent to Oladimeji.
