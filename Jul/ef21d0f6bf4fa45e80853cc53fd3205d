Rules of Origin (RoO) could be a game changer for Africa and enable the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to catalyse the continent’s regional integration by generating significant gains. The United Nations’ Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) made this known in its “Economic Development in Africa Report 2019.” RoO is a “passport” enabling goods to circulate duty-free within a free trade area, if those goods qualify as originating within the area. They are, therefore, one of the cornerstones for boosting trade on the continent, according to UNCTAD. The UN’s agency in the report estimated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most African countries could increase by up to three per cent once all tariffs are eliminated, if RoO is made simple and business-friendly. The 2019 Ibrahim Forum Report highlighted that Africa’s most urgent challenge was the fact that its massive youth bulge has mostly been devoid of prospects. About 60 per cent of Africa’s population is currently under 25 years old, and the continent’s youth will account for twice Europe’s  population in 2100. However, demographic and economic trends are not in tune. While important economic growth of the last decade has mainly been jobless, Africa’s youths consider unemployment by far the most pressing challenge for their governments to address. Besides hindering the potential of Africa’s biggest resource, its human capital and lack of economic opportunity are also key driver of African migrations, which are mainly composed of young and educated people. In some cases, the absence of prospects can also influence young people to join extremist groups. These urgent challenges can only be addressed by African countries, and the AfCFTA is an important step towards this. The AfCFTA is a trade agreement among African Union (AU) member states, aiming at creating a single continental market for goods and services as well as a union of customs with free movement of capital and persons.
