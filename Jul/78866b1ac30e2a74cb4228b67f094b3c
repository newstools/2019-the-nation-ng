The Lagos State government has advised contractors to comply with its guidelines on construction of houses or face sanctions. The Permanent Secretary (PS) for Housing, Mr. Wasiu Akewusola, gave the warning duirng the inspection of state housing schemes at Igando and Egan. Akewusola, in an interview, said variations in quality and measurements affect the structure of buildings. The PS reiterated the mission of the government “to provide and hand over high quality and safe shelters that are habitable to end users.” He said: “The government  would not tolerate any contractor who cut corners to increase profit at the detriment of the people who will live in the homes.” Akewusola urged  government contractors to abide by the standards as failure to do so could  attract demolition of structure;  withholding of payments until necessary adjustment or correction  is made to meet the laid down standard and their blacklisting. He noted: “Lagos State is known for high quality building  construction and will not in any way give the citizenry anything short of that.’’
