Though Hassen had a decent game, including a late save that stopped Ghana winning the match, he reacted badly when he was denied the chance to be in goal for the ensuing penalty shootout. Instead, Coach Alain Giresse brought in Ben Mustapha for the shootout, a decision which Hassen openly protested as he reluctantly left the pitch. However, the France-based goalkeeper having reviewed his action has tendered an apology blaming his behaviour on the passion he has for the national team.
