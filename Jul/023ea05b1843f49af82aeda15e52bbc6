President Muhammadu Buhari has sent warm felicitations to Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, on his 85th birthday, July 13, 2019. He rejoiced with the literary icon for being one of the country’s greatest prides, and a universal brand. President Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Femi Adesina, joined family and friends of the cerebral academic in celebrating the many years of laudable achievements, recognitions, awards, and consistency, all which have cumulated in pride to Nigerians, Africans and the black race. Buhari saluted Prof Soyinka for his intellectual momentum, interventions on state issues and polity through articles and comments, penchant for justice, and persistence in holding leaders to account. As he clocks 85, President Buhari affirmed that Prof Soyinka’s lifestyle sends a message to all Nigerians and Africans, especially the younger generation, that real success is measured by the intangibles of courage and impact brought to the life of others, rather than pursuit of personal interests. The President congratulated the literary giant for projecting Nigerian and African values to the world. He wished him more years of health, wisdom and service to the nation and humanity.
