President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said that he remained committed to a safe Nigeria. The country has been facing one security challenge or the other, which led to former President Olusegun Obasanjo releasing an open letter to President Buhari on Monday, criticising the administration. But speaking at the State House while receiving the Muhammadu Buhari/Osinbajo (MBO) Dynamic Support Group led by the National Coordinator, Usman Ibrahim, Buhari said the aim is to have a Nigeria where families will be safe and children having opportunities for comfortable lives. “As leaders in your various communities, I urge you all to take the message back to your community. It is not about politics, religion or tribe. It is about having a Nigeria where our family will be safe and our children we have plenty opportunities to earn a living and have comfortable lives.” he stated. Thanking the group for the hard work and dedication during the 2019 elections campaign, he said that his administration is committed to delivering on its mandate.
