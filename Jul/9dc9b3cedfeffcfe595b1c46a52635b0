In a bid to contribute towards the development of manpower and professionals in insurance industry in the country, the Professional Insurance Ladies Association(PILA), Abuja Chapter, has launched a tutorial centre in Abuja. PILA President, Mrs. Ose Oluyanwo while speaking at the launch, said the centre offers lectures for certificate, diploma and advanced diploma at highly discounted fees, while also providing reading room facilities, sale of text books as well as training rooms for the insurance industry and the general public. While stating that PILA is an association under the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) that is poised for great strides and visibility, she added that the association is always at the forefront of promoting growth of female insurance practitioners and the insurance industry at large. PILA, Abuja chapter, she stressed is not set up for profit but to provide lectures, coaching and other insurance career training programmes for current and future insurance students in Abuja. Abuja chapter of PILA, according to her, was inaugurated in 2005, out of the desire to increase and promote insurance knowledge in Abuja in particular and Nigeria in general. CIIN President, Mr. Eddie Efekoha lauded the insurance ladies body, stating that PILA has added professional contents to the activities of the institute since inception, promising them of CIIN’s support in all their activities. He added that the development of manpower for the insurance industry would go a long way to ensure that there are more insurance professionals in the industry. A lot of candidates who have applied for CIIN exams have challenges and the study centre is a seed in this direction that will yield multiple results, in the areas of manpower growth and development in the near future. I commend PILA and the sponsors of this project, he pointed out.
