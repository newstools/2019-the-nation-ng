The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) Mr Kabiru Ibrahim, has identified insecurity as the bane of agricultural development in the country. Ibrahim told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja yesterday that insecurity was a major setback for agricultural. The president called on the Federal Government to tackle insecurity in the country, particularly in the North East to enable agriculture to thrive. He said the major challenge facing agriculture in Nigeria was the issue of insecurity that had made it impossible for farmers to go to the farm. According to him, most farmers no longer go to the farm for fear of being killed as the country is fast becoming fragile because of insecurity. Ibrahim said: “We thought with the new focus on agriculture promotion policy, we are already getting into the Promised Land. “You can see how fast we get out of recession but if we do not curb or stop the issue of insecurity all these gains we are enjoying will soon end. “I appeal to the government and all security agencies to work assiduously to ensure peace in the land that will provide the enabling environment for agriculture to thrive.’’ “Once we are able to feed ourselves we have solved the most important problem in Nigeria.’’
