The Luxury Reporter magazine celebrates its fifth anniversary with a well-attended event by experts in the luxury sector held at The Wheatbaker Hotel, Ikoyi, Lagos recently. The event afforded attendees a glimpse into the activities of the magazine since it was founded on May 24, 2014. Speaking at the event, Mrs Funke Osae-Brown, founder/publisher of The Luxury Reporter, said the idea for the magazine came to her at a point in her career when she knew she wanted to embark on a new adventure. According to her, the magazine kicked off five years ago with a website, www.luxuryreporter.comg.ng before it began its print edition three years later. “We ran the website for more than a year. Before we migrated to www.luxuryreporter.ng. We later introduced the digital edition of the magazine which we did for two full years with 24 digital editions. Along the line, we identified a market for print. Hotels, private jets operators, airlines, automobile companies, retail stores need print editions for their clients. “In January 2018, we announced our first print edition which had on the cover emerging brands and a buyer, Abela, TPS Luxury, Pere Lei, Okiki Marinho, Scentify, and Ndidi Obioha,” she said. Besides, she explained that the print edition paved the way for our exclusive partnership with PrivateJets Nigeria as advertisers in The Luxury Reporter print edition will have 30 seconds clips of their advert placed in the in-flight entertainment screen of all the aircraft of PrivateJets. “Our vision is to report on the African Luxury by projecting Nigerian brands.  We are constantly in search of indigenous luxury brands that will compete with international brands.  We believe this will contribute to the economic growth of Africa. At TLR, we don’t just want Nigeria to be a consumer of luxury but also the manufacturer of luxury products that can compete with their counterparts not just on the continent but globally,” she explained.
