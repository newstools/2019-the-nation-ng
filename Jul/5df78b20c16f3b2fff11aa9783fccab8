Kwara State Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has lamented the poor state of education, saying a new dawn has come and all that needs to be done will be put in place to regain the lost educational glory. Abdulrazaq, who was the special guest of honour at the Thomas Adewumi International School, Oko, lamented that “Kwara used to be number one in Northern Nigeria, now Kaduna has overtaken us. Long term planning is essential and that we are doing,” The governor hailed the entrepreneurial accomplishments of Dr. Johnson Adewumi, the Asiwaju of Oko-Irese and Founder of TAICO and TAUO. He added that Adewumi’s vision matches his government’s vision. He said: “I promised in my manifesto to promote enterprise. This is a good example of it. I had been depressed by what I had been seeing during my inspection of government institutions, but my visit to this place, and with what I have seen, has lifted my spirit.” The governor also lauded the communal spirit of Adewumi, saying ”you are building a huge community here, but not just only Oko community but attracting investments from other institutions. You are a serious entrepreneur; we shall partner with you”. Adewumi, in his remarks, said: “I’m speechless. It is a new dawn of leadership in Kwara. You are the first Kwara governor to come here, and we are highly honoured. We are praying for you so that the story of Kwara will be re-written for good.
