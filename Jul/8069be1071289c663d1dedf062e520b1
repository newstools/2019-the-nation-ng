The immediate past governor of Adamawa State, Sen Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow, has congratulated Governor Adeboyega Oyetola of Osun State on his victory at the Supreme Court. In a statement signed by his Personal Assistant on Media and Publicity, Martins Dickson, Sen Jibrilla Bindow said the victory is well deserved and a relief for the governor to concentrate on governance as he implements the party’s manifesto in the state. “Governor Adegboyega will now concentrate on his primary functions as governor devoid of the distractions associated with court cases. I applaud the majority decision of the apex court delivered by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour,” Bindow said. He also congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari over the victory, stating that the judgement is an indication that the APC was genuinely voted for across Nigeria, considering the number of victories the party has gained in courts across the country recently. He urged APC members to remain committed to the party and anticipate victory in all pending court cases across the country.
