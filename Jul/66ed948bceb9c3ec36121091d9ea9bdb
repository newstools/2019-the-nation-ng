He said the Nigeria Customs Service will continue to sustain its fight against all forms of smuggling activities with a view to complying with directives of checkmating the illegal activities going on around our borders and Sea ports. Ahmad said the Command has also confiscated three containers of imported vegetable cooking oil worth millions. Displaying the seized items before reporters, Comptroller Ahmed said the goods were intercepted at APM Terminal along Zaria road in Kano. “According to him, each container was loaded with over 1000 jerry cans of 25 litres of foreign vegetable cooking oil and the estimated Duty Paid Value (DPV)was estimated at N44 million. “These products are outrightly contraband. They are not supposed to be imported not to talk of being in the market. We would not relent in our efforts to identify and confiscate such products as well as prosecute defaulters,” he stressed. He warned the Service has the statutory duty of safeguarding the society from any harmful products banned from coming into the Country hence, would not relent in arresting and prosecuting any one caught supplying such products. Ahmad appealed to the general public to further join hands with the Customs and other sister agencies to expose individuals or group of persons into the importation of contraband products.
