Some All Progressives Congress (APC) members in Kogi State under the aegis of Kogi State Stakeholders Forum have warned the party against using indirect primaries to pick its governorship candidate for the November election. They said in a statement in Lokoja, the state capital, that the party risked a defeat if it adopted indicted primaries. They said: “the victory of APC in 2015 and the events thereafter are still fresh in our memories but it will be the height of delusion for any sincere party faithful of our great party to assume the success achieved then can be replicated in the next election if a level playing field is not availed all aspirants for a free, fair and credible process that will be acceptable to all, irrespective of the outcome. “To proclaim all is well with APC in the state is deceitful and playing the Ostrich which might have unpalatable consequences for the party in the coming election. “Despite the number of aspirants who have indicated the desire to contest, the leadership of our party should ignore any position expressed by online poster aspirants on which mode of election to adopt for the primaries.” The group said: “We are firmly convinced that direct primaries will enable level playing field majority of aspirants have been clamoring for. Indirect primary will confer unmerited advantage on some aspirants which will reduce the process into an unfair, restricted and compromised contest. The consequences of indirect primary election for our great party will be dire, which makes our call for direct primary election imperative.”
