Construction work on the ongoing dualisation of the 145km Mfom-Bekwara-Obanliku highway in Cross River State attained an important milestone weekend with the commencement of asphalting of the Okuku-Okpoma-Mfom section of the road. Already over 25km of the Obanliku-Obudu axis of the road has been completely asphalted and fitted with street lights and media. With this development, the asphalting of the highway is now ongoing from the two sections of the road simultaneously. Adjudged the most ambitious road project ever undertaken by any Governor, the road project cuts across the five local government areas of northern Cross River. The Project Manager, Mr. John Najar estimates by October or November, at least 80km of the road would have been completed. An indigene of the area, Mr. Joseph Odey, commended Ben Ayade for the initiative and the speed of work. “To be honest with you, I was one of the doubting Thomases. I never believed this project will even reach the stage it is now. “We were calling this place before, Ayade dust or power because of the dust. “We don’t know the magic Ayade is doing because I know Cross River is no longer rich like it used to be because of the loss of the littoral status. “He has managed to do this with other projects like the Canadian School, Reference Hospital and the Airport which he just started in Obudu,” he stated. A motorist, Moses Awhen said the progress of work has been breathtaking. “First of all, I want to apologize to the Governor on behalf of all of us who said one bad thing or the other against him at the commencement of this project. “Our Governor is a Professor and we are local drivers that don’t even understand development. “What you see here today is a miracle because if you had come here a few months back, you would have seen how we used our own mouth to condemn our brother because of this wonderful project.”
