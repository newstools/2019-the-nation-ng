THE last, definitely, has not been heard of the benevolent disposition of Rev. Esther Ajayi, who is renowned for showering gifts on churches and individuals she comes in contact with. In the last few years, the General Overseer of Love of Christ Church in Clapham, London, has been shuttling Nigeria, hosting one Christian programme after another and uniting the different denominations in the body of Christ. Only recently, she declared that her philanthropic gestures were not yet enough, adding that she does not like the idea of being a benefit to people in other parts of the world while only coming to Nigeria on short visits. To change the foregoing scenario, she is at the verge of completing the permanent site of her church in Lagos. The stadium-like edifice, which is being constructed by one of the famous construction companies in Nigeria, according to her, will ensure that her church is based in Lagos. Rev. Ajayi is sparing no expense to ensure that the church building makes a huge class statement.
