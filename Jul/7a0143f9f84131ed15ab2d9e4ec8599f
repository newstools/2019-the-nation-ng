Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has launched a solar energy system for eight rural health facilities, most of them general hospitals. The hospitals, located in Gulak, Michika, Mubi, Maiha, Garkida, and Ga’anda will by implication have 24-hour uninterrupted electricity whether or not there is power from public supply. The Adamawa scheme, which is part of a wider Solar Nigeria Project, is funded by the European Union(EU) with the Adamawa State Government, UKAide, and others as partners. Speaking at the launch of the Adamawa scheme in Yola on Friday, the EU Head of Cooperation, Kurt Cornelis, explained that the Solar Nigeria Programme in Adamawa State is aimed at providing access to sustainable energy supply to off-grid public health facilities in the state. The EU will spend 8 million Euros in the state, according to Mr Cornelis who said, “In Adamawa State, we are investing 10 million euros … to provide sustainable energy to eight health facilities using solar PV. They include five general hospitals, one tertiary health institution and two primary health centres.” The benefitting communities are in the northern part of Adamawa, the part most affected by Boko Haram attacks. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri who launched the project through his Chief of Staff, Professor Maxwell Gidado, described it as a people-oriented, life-impacting project that will bring relief to the Boko Haram ravaged communities. The governor thanked the EU for the intervention and said his government would appreciate other projects that would bring relief to people affected by conflicts involving herdsmen and farmers.
