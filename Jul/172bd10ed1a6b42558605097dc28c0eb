Leading online shopping firm, Jumia, has donated books approved by the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) for junior secondary school curricular to Agidingbi Junior Grammar School, Ikeja. It said it was part of activities to celebrate its seventh anniversary in the country. The donation held at the company’s Ikeja warehouse; two teachers and about 20 student representatives were on hand to receive the materials. Jumia also organised a career talk for the student representatives on the opportunities within the e-commerce landscape and what they could do to start and grow a career in the sector. Jumia Nigeria’s Public Relations and Communications Manager, Olukayode Kolawole, said the gesture, which aligns with the company’s education-focused corporate social responsibility (CSR) project, was aimed at increasing access to quality educational materials and promoting good reading culture among secondary school pupils in the country. He said: “Education is an integral part of our corporate social responsibility programmes at Jumia Nigeria. We remain focused on our mission to use technology to improve the quality of everyday lives in the country, and by extension Africa. Increasing access to quality educational materials for young secondary school students who are the leaders of tomorrow aligns with our mission. We continue to build the next future tech leaders, and at the heart of this endeavour lies the need to equip these future leaders with the right information and guidance on how to build a career in the fledgling Nigerian e-commerce industry.”
