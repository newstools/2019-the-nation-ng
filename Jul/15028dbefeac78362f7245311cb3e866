THE first set of Ekiti University College of Medicine is ready for graduation following the release of the final Professional MBBS Examination with outstanding performance. This came after the students had spent 10 years on the programme due to delay in their institution’s accreditation by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN). The MDCN, at its third plenary meeting held on June 13, 2019, considered the report of the 14-member visitation team led by its Registrar, Dr. T.A.B Sanusi, sent to inspect the facilities in the institution’s college. With the accreditation, the students participated in the final Professional MBBS Examination, which was held between July 8 and 19. A statement signed in Ado-Ekiti yesterday by the institution’s Head, Directorate of Information, Bode Olofinmuagun, said: “The released result indicated 100 per cent pass, as all the 43 students presented passed, with one distinction. “With this development, the medical students are to be fully inducted into the medical profession in a few days.” According to him, the Acting Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Olubunmi Ajayi, congratulated the first set of medical doctors to be produced by the university. He lauded Governor Kayode Kayode Fayemi, his wife, Erelu Bisi, the Pro-chancellor and Chairman of Council, Prof. Bamitale Omole, the Medical College team, led by the provost, Prof. Kehinde Oluwadiya, parents and other stakeholders for their financial and logistics support in ensuring that the College of Medicine was accredited.
