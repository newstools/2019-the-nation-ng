About a year ago, Egbe, who is known for her successes with films like ‘Lekki Wives’, ‘The Women’, ‘This thing called marriage’, ‘One Room’, ‘Two brides and a baby’ and others had called for an audition where over 1000 artistes gathered out of which she assembled a cast and crew of over 400 to deliver what many who have seen snippets consider as one her very best films ever. Speaking during the week, Egbe who screen played, produced and directed The Ten Virgins said feelers coming from Nigeria’s community of film goers reveal that the film would get a warm reception.
