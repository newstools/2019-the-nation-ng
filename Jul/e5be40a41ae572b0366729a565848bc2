The Anambra State government has banned the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) from operating in the state. Transport Commissioner, Uchenna Okafor, said in Awka, the state capital, that the ban became necessary following ceaseless negative reports about  the  activities of the association. He warned that any person or group operating on the guise of tricycle operators would be dealt with. He said: ”TOAN is strange to Anambra State government; the group operates in disguise and in very negative circumstances. “No union can exist without the consent of the government.” The commissioner urged security agencies in the state to ensure that TOAN and any other such unknown groups operating under the name cease to exist in the state.
