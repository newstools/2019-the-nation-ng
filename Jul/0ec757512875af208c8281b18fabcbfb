LAGOS State Commissioner of Police Zubairu Muazu on Thursday warned pipeline vandals to desist from the act or face the law. He decried the havoc wreaked in Ijegun by the vandals and urged residents to be vigilant and security conscious. “I sincerely sympathise  with the victims of the explosion but I must warn all intending vandals to beware of further action as strict surveillance will be ensured,” he said. He frowned at the siting of a gas station near the pipeline, asking that it should be relocated because it is a security threat to the community.
