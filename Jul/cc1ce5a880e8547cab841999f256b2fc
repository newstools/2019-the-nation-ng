The first petitioners’ witness at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT),Buba Galadima, a critic of President Muhammadu Buhari said he supported Buhari’s presidential ambition in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015, because he believed Buhari as qualified to lead the country.

He said the government appointed his daughter, Zainab Buba Galadima as member of the Board of Film Corporation, Jos. He said his daughter is not currently Special Assistant to Buhari, arguing that his daughter is very qualified for any appointment, being an adult, well educated and worked for the success of Buhari’s election.
