International Vocational, Technical and Enterpreneurship College (IVTEC)  Rector Dr Ade Somide has described the mode of skills acquisition in the country as outdated. Somide said this in Ajase-Ipo, Irepodun Local Government Area of the state, during the matriculation of 468 students for a three-month special certificate programme for artisans in the college. He said: “The mode of training and skills acquisition in Nigeria is archaic, old fashioned and it does not fit in well with the 21st century knowledge economy. This college was established as way to modernise the mode of training in this county so that we can have highly skilled labour capable of competing anywhere in the world. We believe it is very important because it not only addresses the issue of poverty it also empowers youth to go out and become employers of labour.” The students were sponsored by the Youth Employment and Social Support Operation (YESSO), Kwara State Internal Revenue Service (KWIRS), the Presidency, and other institutions. By the end of their programme, Somide said the students would be able to start their own businesses. He said: “Today’s matriculating class  comprised 350 S4J YESSO candidates sponsored by World Bank/National Directorate of Employment, 46 artisans sponsored by KWIRS, 70 N-Power-Build candidates and finally a handful of direct applicants for a total of 468 from all the 16 local government areas of the state. “All IVTEC programmes have an entrepreneurship components built into our curriculum, which enable our trainees leave here with requisite skills and competencies to start their own businesses and become employers of labour. In addition, the college facilitates internship placement and industrial attachment, which is a key component of the N-Power S4J schemes.”
