THE importance of proper waste disposal came to the fore recently when a group of teenagers from GreenSpring School, Anthony, under the umbrella of ‘Save the Face of Lagos’ initiative visited Oko-Agbon area of Makoko slums on a vigorous campaign. The campaign, which was in conjunction with the charity outreach of the Fountain of Life Church to the community to feed and educate the people on the importance of hygienic living, saw the teenagers donating eight 6-wheeler waste bins to the community. According to the coordinator of the group, Princess Okonkwo, the Save the Face of Lagos campaign aims to combat the issues that some of the less-privileged locations in Lagos face. She explained that the indiscriminate disposal of waste in the community poses great danger to the health of the people, hence the need to educate them and also provide them with modern ways of disposing their waste. “We had a meeting with the Lagos State Waste Management Authority, LAWMA, and agreed on a day that the trash trucks would come and collect the dirt from the community. However, because the truck couldn’t drive into the slum to pick up the trash, the people would have to find a way to get the trash to the main road. “Of course, we came up with a solution: we donated about eight 6-wheeler bins to be put in open spaces that everyone can access, and on the day of trash collection the residents would just have to wheel the bins out to the main road,” she added.
