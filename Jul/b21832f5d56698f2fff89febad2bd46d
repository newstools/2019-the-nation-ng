The Kwara branch of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has called on government at all levels to intensify efforts at improving security of lives and properties. The Chairman of NMA in the state, Dr Kolade Solagbade, made the call at the 2019 Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference held  on Monday in Ilorin. Solagbade said the issue of national security had been a major concern and doctors were worst hit considering the nature of their work. The theme of the conference, which was ”National Security and the Medical Profession, ” focused on bringing into perspective the issue of national security as it affects medical practitioners. According to Solagbade, the event is an annual programme spanning the whole week. He added that the  medical and surgical outreach would be held for indigent patients on Tuesday before the scientific conference on Wednesday. “The outreach will hold in Kwara Central Senatorial District in Adewole ward of Kwara. ”Gov.  Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq will further demonstrate NMA’s support and readiness for collaboration and partnership toward healthcare improvement. `The governor has demonstrated his determination to revive the health sector from its moribund state. “We wish him well and assure him of our maximum support toward achieving successes for the people of Kwara. “We enjoin the governor to involve Kwara NMA , the body of all doctors working in the state, in the formulation of health policies to achieve greater success,” Solagberu said.
