The Benin Monarch, Oba Ewuare II, has said he intervened in the feud between Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki but the crisis escalated. Oba Ewuare II spoke when he received members of the House of Representatives ad hoc committee set up to look into the Edo Assembly crisis. He said he was about to meet both men again when he heard about the committee. He said: “Like I told President Buhari that I have been talking to the two parties involved, Oshiomhole and the incumbent governor on different occasions. I have invited both of them to discuss with them but things are escalating too fast. “I was still planning to meet both of them when I heard the House of Representatives has set up an ad hoc committee to look into the issue and I pray that you are successful in this task ahead.” Chairman of the committee, Abdulrazak Namdas (APC ADAMAWA) said the committee was set up to investigate the crisis in the Edo state House of Assembly and to bring lasting solution to the problem. Speaking to newsmen at the Benin Airport, he said; “I am the chairman of the committee and we are here to do the fact findings to meet with the honourable members, stakeholders, clerk of the house and all the people that are expected to be seen; we are ready to see them today. And then get back to Abuja “We have started the process already; this committee has been given just a week, we have met the governor of the state, we have met with other members of the house of assembly, Edo state that are in Abuja. And we are going to meet with the other ones that are here in Edo and the clerk. “We are men of integrity, we are able politicians in our own right, we have track records to prove and men you can never question their character.”  Details shortly…
