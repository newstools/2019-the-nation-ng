The University of Benin (UNIBEN) final year student of Accounting who attempted  suicide was under pressure, her colleague has said. The friend denied that the student Ifeoma atempted to kill herself because she was jilted. The victim’s friends rescued her  and took her to the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH). An eyewitness, who gave her name as Esther Osagiede, said Ifeoma was depressed owing to class workload. Ifeoma allegedly took some pesticide. Osaigede said: “I will like to dispute the rumour that Ifeoma took the poison due to a break-up. Ifeoma did not break up with anybody. She was just under pressure due to her final year project and other school activities. She just didn’t know who to confide in; so she became depressed.’’ ‘’She is not a crazy person like most people believed. She was lost and misguided. But we are happy she survived,’’ another of her roommate said. CAMPUSLIFE learnt that Ifeoma has been discharged. According to CAMPUSLIFE, the incident occurred at Queen Idia Hostel (Hall 1) in the university’s main campus Ugbowo. Osagiede recounted how the incident happened. She said: “Ifeoma is a very good and humble person. I was shocked when on that fateful day, I rushed into the hostel and saw that she was the one who took the sniper poison.’’ Osagiede said she and Ifeoma’s  roommates forced her to drink palm oil to detox the poison. One of the victim’s roommates, who preferred to remain anonymous, also told CAMPUSLIFE how they tried to rescue her. “After giving her palm oil, we rushed her to the University of Benin Health Centre. When we got there, the doctor referred us to University of Benin Teaching Hospital. Luckily for us, we got there on time. She was placed on admission while the doctor commenced treatment immediately.
