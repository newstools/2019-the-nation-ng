A three-day old baby boy has been rescued from an erosion site behind Girls Secondary School Amaenyi, Awka South local government area of Anambra state. The abandoned baby was reportedly discovered around 10 pm by four children between the ages of 9 and 14 while on a snail hunt. The Nation gathered that the child, suspected to have been dumped immediately after birth, was reportedly found inside a black sack. The teenage rescuers were said to have alerted their elder sister who quickly took the baby to a hospital for immediate attention. Transition Committee Chairman, Awka South Council Area, Mr. Leo Nwuba, who handed over the child to the Ministry of Social Welfare, Children and Women Affairs, said the council decided to hand the baby over to the state to ensure his proper upbringing. He described the child as a divine baby who survived death and thanked those who played significant role in his rescue. Nwuba expressed hope that the baby would become a shining light for the state through the love of the wife of the state governor, Chief Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano. Narrating their encounter with the baby, one of the teenage rescuers, Obinna Onyebuchi said they had mistook the baby for a dog. He said, “When we first sighted the black sack, we thought it was a dog but a closer look showed it was a new born baby. “We quickly ran home in fear to alert our sister who instructed us to bring the baby home.” The elder sister, Miss Onyekachi Eze, on her part, confirmed that the baby was brought to her by her siblings while on snail hunt with blood on him. “I quickly cleaned him up and took him to a police station before taking him to a hospital for medical care,” she said. The hand over ceremony which took place at the council headquarters, Amawbia, was witnessed by the four teenagers.
