The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested three people over the kidnapping of the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry of Mineral Resources, Emmanuel Piridimso. Piridimso, who was abducted about two weeks ago by gunmen who demanded N25 million ransom, was released a couple of days later. But the police had kept on the trail of the kidnappers. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Sulaiman Yahaya, confirmed in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Saturday that his men had rounded up three of the four wanted suspects. The PPRO gave the name of one of them as Adamu Ahmadu but said he needed further information from his fieldmen to be able to name the two others. He said the journey to the three suspects in custody started immediately after they abducted their victim on July 11. He said that after the incident, the Commissioner of Police deployed men from anti-kidnap unit, men from IGP Rapid Response Unit and men from state CID and intelligence department to trace the suspects. “While the operation was on, the kidnappers got information that we were after them and so released the victim. “After we got the victim to make a statement, we extracted useful information, including a phone number which our intelligence department used to trace one suspect, a resident of Jimeta in Yola North Local Government Area,” the PPRO said. He added that the police established the first identified suspect had a form of relationship with the permanent secretary as both used to meet in certain places. That enabled him to be the linkman who got the kidnappers into the permanent secretary’s house. The PPRO said on the arrest and interrogation of the first identified suspect, he mentioned three others. While two were arrested in Maijaro village in Song LGA, one is still at large. “The three we have in our custody have confessed committing the crime,” he said, disclosing that the police had recovered three fabricated AK 47 rifles from them
