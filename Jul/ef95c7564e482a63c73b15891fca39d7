A lecturer at the Kwara State College of Education, Oro, Mr Babatunde Abdulkareem, has called on the Federal government to ban special examination centers in the country as a way to curb examination malpractices. Abdulkareem, who is the Head of Political Science Department in the college, made the call in Ilorin on Wednesday while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said the number of special centers in the country were increasing everyday, alleging that such centers were known for encouraging cheating during examinations. According to the lecturer, most parents prefer to pay extra amount to register their children in the “miracle centers” as a sure way to guarantee success in examinations. “You can see every building in the country is now used for examination. “Some business centers are also used as examination halls where you can just stroll in and write exams for a huge fee without any proper check. “The Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE), Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) and other examinations have become a easy ride for candidates as there are special sure centers all over the country. “The Federal Government and education stakeholders must stop pretending and act fast to ban special centers. Exam malpractice is evil and should not be encouraged,” he said. Abdulkareem urged the Federal Government and stakeholders to set up monitoring agencies during examinations to arrest the owners of the centers. He also called on parents to encourage their children to study hard for their examinations and stop looking for shortcuts to pass examinations. “Registering your children in miracle centers is not the best. You are only trying to ruin your children’s future. “We all need to speak up and say ‘No’ to exam malpractices to save education in the country,” Abdulkareem said. (NAN)
