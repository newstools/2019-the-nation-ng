There were concerns in Odoni community, Sagbama Local Government Area, Bayelsa State on Tuesday following failure of kidnappers of Madam Ogere Siasia, the mother of a former Coach and player of the Super Eagles, Samson Siasia to call any of the family members. It was gathered the concerns were based on the failing health of Ma Ogere, who was abducted without her anti-hypertensive drugs and mobile handsets. Family members living in Odoni and Yenagoa, the state capital, were said to be disturbed over the possibility of their 80-year-old mother surviving the abduction. The octogenarian mother and two other persons, including a woman and her 17-year-old granddaughter were whisked away on Monday at 2am by gunmen. The gunmen, who came on speedboats through the River Nun, that criss-crosses the community, broke into the house through the front door and took their victim to an unknown destination. They also broke into a house along the road to the River Nun and abducted a 60-year-old woman with her granddaughter and fled unchallenged. Harrison, 93-year-old husband of the victim, urged the abductors to release his wife and wondered why the woman was always their target. “I am appealing to the abductors to release to my wife. Why are they always kidnapping my wife? They should please set her free. “My wife is sick. They took her without her drugs. I am begging them to release her,” he said. It was gathered that the police were still looking for clues to unmask the identities of her kidnappers.
