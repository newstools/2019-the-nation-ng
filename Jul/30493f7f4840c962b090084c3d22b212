An 18-year-old artisan, Oluwagbemi Abiola, charged with stealing a motorcycle valued at N230,000, has been arraigned at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, whose residential address was not provided, was arraigned before Magistrate Mrs. O.A Aderibigbe on a one-count charge of stealing. Abiola, however, denied committing the offence and was admitted to N50,000 bail with one surety in the like sum. Aderibigbe said the surety should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Inspector Mojirafe Edeme said the defendant committed the offence on July 20 at Alagbado, Lagos. She said the defendant stole the motorcycle belonging to Mr. Anam Cypran. “The complainant parked his motorcycle in his compound and the defendant came early in the morning to roll it away. “Unfortunately for him, two landlords accosted him and asked him where he got the motorcycle. He refused to talk and was taken to the police station along with the motorcycle. “When the complainant woke up and could not find his motorcycle, he rushed to the station to report the theft. “He was told that a young man was just brought to the station for his inability to give a satisfactory account of a motorcycle in his possession. “The motorcycle was released to the complainant after presenting documents to prove ownership,” the prosecutor said. The offence violates Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. The case continues on Thursday.
