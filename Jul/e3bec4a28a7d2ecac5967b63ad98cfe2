The Lagos State Chairman of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Dr. Quasim Akinreti has given members of the Model Press club and Model Anti-Aids club of the African Church Model College (ACMC), Ifako Ijaye tips on how to be good journalists. The chairman gave the advice at the 6th Annual dinner of both clubs themed ‘Relaunch of the Footprints’ in honour of their outgoing SS3 students. He said: “The sky is your limit. To be a good journalist, you need to know history. You need to read widely, literature, novels. You do not have to work for anybody; you can be a media entrepreneur. You must be able to write well, speak good English-Queen’s English not adulterated English. As a journalist, you are a master of all trades”. He further encouraged them to learn the French language as three-quarter of the world speak it. The coordinator of the clubs, Mr Olumide Renner earlier in his welcome address said the dinner was a forum for the club members to learn how to make a better Nigeria. “Unfortunately, the change we craved for seems to have eluded us. Yet we must not despair but continue to hope for a better tomorrow amidst the challenges we face. If Nigeria must be great again and it will, it would be achieved through the next generation not this corrupt generation. It is for the purpose that the clubs through a forum like this teach leadership skills by interacting with experts in various fields.” An ex-student of the school, now a certified theatre artiste from Olabisi Onabanjo University, Shedrack Olowomeye, thrilled the students with a dance performance.  He also advised them to follow their dreams. He said: “Your life starts now, follow your hearts. Do not let anyone talk you down. Also, know that you should be careful what you use social media for. Use it well,;connect with good people, put yourself out there for business and worthwhile connections.”
