The nomination of legal icon and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN), for a ministerial position has been described as hope for unity in the Delta state chapter of the party. Founding leader of the APC in Delta state, Olorogun O’tega Emerhor, who stated this in a statement he personally sent out to journalists in Warri on Wednesday, also thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for selecting a fitting ambassador for Delta to his cabinet. Recalling the journey of Keyamo into the very heart of the party in both Delta state and the center, the party leader said the legal luminary joined the party right from the beginning, when he contested the ticket of the Delta Central Senatorial District for the October 2013 by-election. “Chief Festus Keyamo is a founding member of APC in Delta State. He has been there from the beginning when he contested the APC Delta Central primaries for the October 2013 senatorial bye election, barely four months after the registration of APC as a party. Keyamo has continue since then, working assiduously for the growth of APC both in Delta State and in Nigeria. “His appointment as the Director of Strategic communications for the Buhari re-election campaign further undisputedly established him as a key Delta APC ambassador and unveiled his strength and passion for Mr. President’s vision of good governance for Nigeria. “I therefore whole heartedly congratulate him on behalf of myself and the larger Emerhor political family of APC in Delta State for a timely and well deserved appointment. I believe his appointment is a good omen to Delta State APC and portends great hopes for the unity and fortunes of the party moving forward. “I also seize the opportunity to thank Mr. President for appointing this outstanding legal luminary and a great son of Urhobo Nation and Delta State to the Federal Executive council,” Emerhor said.
