Civil Servants under the aegis of Concerned Kogi Workers Forum have endorsed the Kogi State All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftainVice Admiral Jibrin Usman for governor. They warned against attempt to foist Governor Yahaya Bello, saying that “it would amount to further shortening our life span”. According to their spokesman  Hassan Abdul, “ as workers who bear the brunt of Governor Bello’s misrule, another opportunity given to him by the APC would mean reducing our lifespan” The forum is made up of workers who were arbitrarily sacked and not paid for about 30 months. The workers said many of them have died untimely, with many unable to meet family obligations. The workers said while they do not have grouse with President Mohammadu Buhari and the APC, they have an axe to grind with Bello. They said their support for Usman stemmed from his achievements.

Abdul described the present administration of as unfriendly to workers, lamenting that, after many months of clearance by the screening committee, their salaries have not been paid. He said despite the bail outs and Paris Club refunds, Bello has remain insensitive to the welfare of workers.
