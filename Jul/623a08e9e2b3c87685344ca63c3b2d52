The South-South region has been hailed as the bedrock of Nigeria’s bubbling entertainment industry. This sentiment was shared by media entrepreneur, Newton Arunaye, popularly known as Chief Legit, who also averred that region has been grossly under-appreciated for her contribution to the growth of the entertainment sector in the country. In an interview with The Nation, Arunaye, the brain behind the popular South-South entertainment news and lifestyle platform Legit9ja, suggested that there was an age-long imbalance in the Nigerian entertainment industry which has robbed other viable markets in the country of a chance to advance. Speaking about talents from the South-South, Arunaye said that the region has proved to be the most creative region in Nigeria which has produced numerous front liners in all spheres of the industry including music, film, comedy and the arts. He highlighted specific musicians from the South-South like ‘Wetin we gain’ crooner Victor AD, Mavin Records artistes Rema and Johnny Drille, Erigga, John NetworQ, T-West, Dr. Barz, Brenny Jones and producers like popular hitmaker Killertunes, Andre Vibez and others. “I’m not trying to be tribalistic here but let’s look at the data, the biggest entertainers in Nigeria are either those who moved from the South-South to Lagos or are descents of the region and this speaks highly of the creativity that oozes from there,” he said. Arunaye also called on major national brands and local businesses in the region to beam their searchlights on the region and engage local talents and media platforms that will help them to reach their target audiences in order to maximise the visibility of their products or services.
