WORK is to begin on the Alaka Bridge in Lagos, the Federal Controller of Works in Lagos State, Adedamola Kuti, has assured. In an interview, Kuti said the materials for the replacement of its joints had arrived and were being cleared from the port. He said:  “Important materials for the repairs of the expansion joints have arrived and we are at the point of clearing them at the Wharf. We would look at the very critical expansion joints and change them. The contractor has replaced two of the joints.” Kuti said the materials were not available in the country hence, the delay in fixing the bad portions. On the damaged Long Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, he said the joints had been repaired. Kuti, however, said the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing were carrying out a “review” of the work done on the bridge to identify the new faults. He added that he had directed the contractor Julius Berger to speed up the repairs, noting that progress was being made on the reconstruction/rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. He said: “Rain is slowing us down, but work is going on and we are making progress. As at the last report, section one which spans from Lagos to Sagamu Interchange is about 42 per cent completed.” On the trailer park in Apapa, Kuti explained that trailers were already using the park and the contractor was completing some of its facilities. He said: “We have finished one borehole and we are doing some electrical works also.” He said the entire trailer park project has achieved 98 per cent completion while the shoreline protection of the park was 70 per cent completed.
