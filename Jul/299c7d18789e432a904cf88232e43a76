Big Brother on Thursday night blasted housemates of the 2019 ‘Pepper Dem Gang’ edition of the show for breaking the house rules. Biggie, who was infuriated by the behavior of housemates, accused some of them of speaking different Nigerian dialects in the house. He also stated the housemates, who were seen acting for the camera, were not being themselves as they have failed to put their egos away. Biggie, who could not hold his anger, gave the housemates a very low mark for their drama presentation, which was their task for the day, while issuing them a stern warning to be serious with activities of the house. He warned them against focusing on the camera and seeking unnecessary attention, adding that ‘if he wanted camera conscious housemates, he would have hired actors. He also warned against speaking about the ‘viewers’ perception and diary sessions.” He said: “Some of you cannot adhere to simple house rules. ‘Diary session conversations are meant to be private but you keep discussing it with your fellow housemates. You also discuss about what you think the viewers want or might like.” Against the backdrop, the housemate lost their wager for the week.
