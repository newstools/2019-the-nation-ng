A depleted Nigerian side lost to Egypt 47-30 yesterday in their second match of the1HF Men’s Junior (U21) World Championship in Spain. The North African side makes it two wins from two in their group while the Nigerian side have lost both games played so far. The first half ended 18-13 in favour of the Egyptians. Even before Nigeria stepped on court they found themselves struggling to match their rivals having named just 12 players in their squad for Spain 2019 out of a possible 16 allowed – the exact number that Egypt had and to whom their coach Tarek Sayed El-Sayed used effectively from the bench as he rotated his players ahead of a rest day tomorrow and a match against Sweden on Friday. Egypt took their time to settle and, helped by some impressive saves by Michael Agbaji Solomon in the Nigeria goal, his side raced to a 3-0 lead before Egypt opened their account after five minutes. But Nigeria stood strong, despite having Suleiman Usman carried off court with an injury. In a show of great sportsmanship three Egyptian players helped carry him to the sidelines with the Egyptians offering the services of their doctor and physio to help with his recovery. Solomon continued to impress, thanks to a double seven-metre save, but Egypt finally took the lead in the 14th minute (7-6) and did not look back, even slotting home a fantastic in-flight goal after a slick pass from Mohammed Anas to his captain Abdullahi Mohammed. Unfortunately, with 16 technical faults in attack and a red card for Anthony Ngbede Agada after receiving three two-minute suspensions later on, Nigeria did not stand a chance against an Egyptian attack which saw eight goals apiece from Mohsen Ramadan Mahmoud and Shehab Abdalla Ahmed, and nine from Galal Ayman Khorshid, while the best player of the match, Abdelrhman Taha Ali made 14 saves in the Egyptian goal.
