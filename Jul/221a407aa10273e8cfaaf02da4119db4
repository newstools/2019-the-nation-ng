The frequent collapse of the national grid and its attendant disruption of electricity supply would continue nationwide until the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) monitors the grid through a device known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) Principal Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs Angela Adekunle, has said. This is coming on the heels of the collapse of the national grid recently, a development attributed to the fire outbreak at a Benin sub-station, in Edo State. In a statement made available to The Nation, she said inability of the TCN to put in place supervisory control and data acquisition mechanism has led to increase in collapse of the electricity grid in recent times. According to her, grid has collapsed 100 times since 2013, when the new investors took over the assets of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). She said: “Until TCN provides Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition to monitor the operation of the national grid in order to discover its problems and subsequently provide solution to it, the collapse of the grid would continue.” Adekunle said the grid has collapsed nine times alone in 2019, adding that it is high time TCN provided solution to it. Also, her counterpart in the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), Mr Emeka Eze, said the recent collapse affected social and economic activities across the country. He told The Nation that the issue affected some franchise areas owned by the firm before it was addressed.
