The Lagos State Government has confiscated a truckload of cowhide described as “Ebola Ponmo” at Ijegun, on the outskirts of Lagos. In a statement on Monday, Ministry of Agriculture Permanent Secretary Dr Olayiwole Onasanya said the cowhide, was imported into the country by some unscrupulous individuals. The police, Onasanya said arrested the vehicle at Ikotun before informing officials of the government. The cowhide, he said, was preserved with chemicals to be used as leather material but they are being sold for human consumption by some criminals. The “Ebola Ponmo”, Onasanya said, had since been transported to the ministry’s outstation at Johnson Agiri Office Complex, Agege for disposal at the medical waste dumpsite in Ewu Elepe, Ikorodu. The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) and Environmental Health Officers have been informed of the discovery and the disposal, he added.
