Members of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) have urged the Federal Government to tighten security. The group, while commiserating with the leader of the Yoruba pan socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, on the murder of his daughter, Mrs. Funke Olakunri, said this would guarantee safety of lives and property. AYCF National President Mallam Yerima Shettima described the dastardly act as very sad, unacceptable and highly condemnable. He stressed the need to put all hands on deck to secure the country. The youth leader urged the government to ensure that the culprits are fished out and punished, assuring President Muhammadu Buhari of “my members’ readiness to assist his administration in its quest to find a solution to insecurity.”
