Three persons, including husband and wife, have died on Thursday when a Lagos – bound commercial bus conveying them from Ijebu – Ode, plunged into Ososa river(in Ogun state) along the Sagamu – Ore expressway. The accident which involved a 14 – seater bus, lost control atop the dual carriage between Ososa and Odogbolu along the expressway, leaving 11 other passengers injured. The Operatives of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps(TRACE ), Nigeria Police and Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) were sighted battling to rescue victims from the river. The Public Relations Officer of TRACE, Babatunde Akinbiyi, attributed the cause of the accident to “mechanical fault.” Akinbiyi added that the injured were evacuated to the Idera Hospital Ijebu – Ode while the dead were taken to the morgue of the State Hospital, Ijebu – Ode. Akinbiyi said:”The commercial bus was travelling to Lagos from Ijebu-Ode and suddenly developed steering rack problem. But instead of the driver to park the bus to find a way of resolving the problem he decided to manage the bus to Lagos with the problem, with passengers in the vehicle complaining bitterly yo him to stop the vehicle and do needful. “Out of the three dead victims, two are were couples (Husband & Wife), while the driver was among the injured. “TRACE Corps is again using this opportunity to implore drivers to desist from managing vehicle on transit to its destination because of the inherent risks involved. All mechanical, electrical and human faults noticed before embarking on a journey should be addressed before hitting the road. “However, TRACE Corps commiserate with the family of the deceased while wishing the injured speedy recovery.”
