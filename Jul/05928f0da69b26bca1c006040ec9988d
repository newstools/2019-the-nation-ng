 Swallows of Burundi achieved something; at least they are no more new comers to the Nations cup after making a debut in Egypt. They played three group matches, lost all to Nigeria, Guinea and Madagascar respectively, conceding four goals and scoring none. They had also kissed the headlines after edging out Gabon to pick a ticket for Egypt 2019. Pierre-Emerick  Aubameyang’s Gabon needed a win in  the final match in Bujumbura but that was not to be as they were held to a 1-1 draw by the Swallows thus putting paid to Panthers dream of making the list in Egypt. Would the Panthers have done better than the Swallows against the same opponents if they had picked the ticket? Well that is no longer necessary, and for Arsenal forward and Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missing the Nations cup may have been painful but life must go on. The £200,000 per-week Gunners forward has added a customised £240,000 Lamborghini Huracan to his incredible car collection now worth £2.1MILLION. The 30 year old African Footballer of the year showed off his new psychedelic-looking motor, which also has a red soft top, by posting a video on his Instagram story. The former Borussia Dortmund star earns a £198,000-a-week salary at Arsenal, meaning it would only take him two weeks to pay for his new Lamborghini. Aubameyang, who netted 31 times in all competitions last season for Arsenal, is expected to return to training soon as Unai Emery prepares to get their pre-season underway.
