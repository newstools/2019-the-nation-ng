The West Africa Container Terminal (WACT) yesterday launched two new Mobile Harbour Cranes (MHCs) $10 million (about N3.6 billion) for the discharge of cargoes at the terminal. The Mobile Harbour Cranes (MHCs), which is coming on the heels of 10 specialised terminal trucks and two new reach stackers, are expected to increase the turnaround time of vessels at the terminal. The two new container cargoes handling facilities would bring WACT, one of the most efficient container terminals outside Lagos, at par with its peers in Apapa, and Tin Can Island Ports, in terms of equipment and operational efficiency. Speaking at the inauguration in Onne, Rivers State, the Managing Director, WACT, Aamir Mirza, said the massive investment at the terminal has attracted 700 direct and 2000 indirect employment in the country.

Mizra described the $10 million investment as a key enabler to customers’ satisfaction. “Our vision is to make WACT the best performing container terminal in West Africa. We believe this vision can be realised early enough if the government can support us to reduce the challenges of security by ensuring the safety of vessels on our waters and improve road connectivity, among others,” he said. Mirza said the cranes would enable volume growth resulting in increased productivity; reduced port stay and provide bunker savings; improve reliability in cargo delivery times; reduce the impact of crane breakdown/idle time on overall terminal operations, and increase customers satisfaction and speedy delivery.

We are happy with the 30 per cent increase in volumes of cargoes and the long run, more Nigerians would be employed and it will make the terminal operation contribute to the economy. “The more efficiency we have, the more cargoes we will get because Nigeria is a natural harbour due to the available market and I am happy today that this terminal is becoming one of the most efficient we have in West Africa and this is gladdening our hearts, and the main reasons for concessioning the port to the private sector will be realised by this terminal and we will use this terminal to benchmark the performance of other terminals.” The Managing Director, Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA), Umana Okon Umana, lauded WACT for making the nation meet the objectives of establishing the free zone.
