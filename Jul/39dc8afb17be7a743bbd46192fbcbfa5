VICE-President Prof Yemi Osinbajo has debunked a report which quoted him last week as saying that the nation was moving the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 25 per cent. Osinbajo, who was represented by a former Special Adviser (SA) to the President on Economic Recovery, Mr. Yomi Dipeolu, at the Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association’s (NECA’s) 62nd annual general meeting (AGM) in Lagos, explained that what he said at the event was that for the country to achieve and sustain growth, it must increase its current ratio of investment to GDP from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.
