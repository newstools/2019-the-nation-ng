The Nigerian Army has disowned a video clip in circulation alleging that an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in it belongs to the military. Army Public Relation’s Director, Col Sagir Musa, stated this in reaction to the video clip in circulation. A statement by the Army spokesman said the military’s brand of unmanned aerial vehicle is more sophisticated than the one being shown. Musa said: “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a video clip containing the photograph of an alleged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) bought by the Nigerian military. “The clip was produced, uploaded by Njenje Media TV on its YouTube channel and circulated through WhatsApp and other social media platforms. “In it, they showed a photograph of group of persons with the equipment, which they compared to those ostensibly owned by other nations, including some of our African neighbours.” “This is far from the truth. Therefore, it should be disregarded in its entirety. “Apart from questioning the motive of this mischievous falsehood, it is imperative to state that the Nigerian military has far more sophisticated UAV and equipment than what the medium is broadcasting. “This accounts for the tremendous success in the fight against terrorism, insurgency and banditry in the country. It will be recalled that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has designed and produced far more superior and sophisticated UAVs and other platforms, such as “Gulma” and “Tsaigumi” than what the medium was showing. Additionally, the Nigerian Army has just commissioned an aviation hangar in Jaji, Kaduna State, for its Aviation Corps. “Another hangar and runway in Bama, Borno State, are on the way where bigger and far more sophisticated UAVs will be deployed and used. “It is important to also state that the African countries mentioned in the clip are not in any way compared to Nigeria in military technology, equipment and platforms as they do not have UAVs, as alleged, but an American military base on their soil.”
