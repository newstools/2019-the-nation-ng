An Igbosere High Court in Lagos on Tuesday heard that a pedestrian, Adams Bello, was killed in August 2016 at Okokomaiko in Ojo, Lagos, when he was hit by a stray bullet allegedly fired by Police Sergeant, Emmanuel Uyanweke. Bello’s son, Afeez, told Justice Adedayo Akintoye that the bullet hit his father in the chest. He testified as the first prosecution witness in Uyanweke’s trial for manslaughter. The Lagos State Government arraigned the policeman on February 14, 2018.
He pleaded not guilty. On July 3, Bello opened his testimony, while led in evidence by an Assistant Director in the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Mr Babatunde Sunmonu.
