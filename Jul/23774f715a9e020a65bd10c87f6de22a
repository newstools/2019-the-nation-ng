The Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky- led Shi’ites group, the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, (IMN) has apparently bowed to pressure from its recent proscription by a Federal High Court resulting from the renewed clashes with the police, as the group on Wednesday announced suspension of its streets protests. IMN said the suspension of its protests, which it termed temporary, was out of respect for eminent people and groups, who have genuinely waded into resolving the problems. IMN, in a statement on Wednesday by its spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, said the movement suspended the protests in good faith and out of respect for eminent people and groups, whose input in the resolution of the problems appears genuine. While reiterating IMN’s demand that their leader, his wife and several others in detention be given their freedom denied to them since 2015, Musa said the movement is committed to exploring the new openings to resolve the protracted issues with the government. He added: “If at all any protests occur anywhere in the country, it might be this notice hasn’t reach those in the field or this message is misunderstood or it is some security agents who are mischievously behind it as they have been doing in an attempt to smear our image and be seen as unruly people rather than as victims of savage oppression since 2015. “The Islamic Movement in Nigeria do hereby announce to the general public and the international community that it has temporarily suspended its Free Zakzaky street protests to allow for some new openings into the resolution of the problems, especially the court case instituted by our lawyers on the proscription order made by the federal government this week. “We sincerely hope an amicable way could be found to solve the crises surrounding the illegal detention of our leader for almost four years now. “The Islamic Movement wishes to thank both national and international civil rights activists and organizations who have been busy demanding the protection of our fundamental human rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We also thank the press, both national and international, and the social media activists for the full coverage of our activities throughout the struggle for justice,” he said.
