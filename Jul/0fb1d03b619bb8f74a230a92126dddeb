A 39-year-old disc jockey (DJ), Anthony Eze, on Tuesday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing goods worth N615,000. He pleaded not guilty Prosecuting Inspector Donjour Perezi said the defendant committed the offence between December 2018 and April at 90, Victoria Street, Ojota. He alleged that the defendant, who is also a personal taxi driver to the complainant, Mrs. Chidinma Amaechi, had been stealing goods from her fairly used goods’ store unnoticed. The prosecutor alleged that the defendant stole five Dell laptops worth N75, 000, 30 cartons of chandeliers worth N300, 000, 15 fire extinguishers worth N45, 000 and a Toyota Sienna headlight valued at N15,000. He added that the defendant also stole a 2006 Toyota Corolla model radiator and a fan valued at N20, 000, a compressor worth N30, 000, a kick starter valued at N5, 000 and a brain box worth N25, 000. Perezi said Eze stole two alloy rims with tyres worth N40, 000 and three batteries worth N60, 000, totalling N615, 000. He said the complainant’s longtime suspicions were proved right when the defendant was caught stealing an item. “Efforts to recover the items were unsuccessful, as they had been sold,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate Bukola Mogaji granted him N100, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The case was adjourned till August 23.
