Emmanuel was abducted at his residence in the state capital, Yola, in the early hours of Wednesday, according to a member of his family,  Francis Samuel, who  said the gunmen stormed the residence of the permanent secretary at Clark’s Quarters in Jimeta, about 3:20 am and took him away. “The gunmen came bearing two guns and abducted the Permanent Secretary at gunpoint. They carted away his handset and that of his wife. “We have tried to no avail to contact the Permanent Secretary through his phone number, and the abductors refused to pick our calls.
