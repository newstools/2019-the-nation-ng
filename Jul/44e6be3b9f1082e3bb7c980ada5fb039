Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said that because of the judicial finality of the Supreme Court, the legal case on the 2018 governorship election in Osun State between Gboyega Oyetola of APC and Senator Ademola Adeleke of the PDP was over. The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the appeal by candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last governorship election in the state, Senator Ademola Adeleke. The presidential candidate of the PDP in the last general election said, “Those who think this is the end of the road for Senator Adeleke and the PDP in Osun, are greatly mistaken. This is not the end. Not even the beginning of the end. No. Today marks the continued ascendancy of Senator Adeleke and his party in the hearts and minds of his people.” He added: ‘I join with people of goodwill all over Nigeria to say to Senator Ademola Adeleke, and the people of the great state of Osun, that we stand with them in good times and in difficult days. “The Supreme Court has ruled and because of its judicial finality, the legal case is over. “However, the love, acceptance and endorsement that the people of Osun bestowed on both Senator Adeleke and the @OfficialPDPNig is not over and cannot be overlooked.”
