Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has said his administration is prepared to receive back home all 4,000 citizens of states currently residing in Cameroon. About 57,000 Nigerians, mostly from the Boko Haram troubled Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states are said to be in the Minawo Camp in northern Cameroon as refugees. A process has been on for a couple of months to receive 4,000 of them who are Adamawa citizens and who have expressed their willingness to return home. Fintiri, who spoke in Yola, while receiving a delegation of the Technical Working Group for Repatriation of Nigerian Refugees, told the group that the state government is ready to facilitate the repatriation of the 4,000 Adamawa citizens. Fintiri commended the Technical Working Group for Repatriation of Nigerian Refugees and the Cameroonian authorities for keeping the Nigerians safe. He said he would constitute a technical committee to support the returnees when they arrive. The leader of the delegation and Federal Commissioner in charge of National Refugees Commission, Hajiya Sadiya Farouq, said the visit of the Technical Working Group for Repatriation of Nigerian Refugees to Yola was to intimate the governor on the plan to start repatriating Adamawa citizens from Cameroon. She said the team would soon start the repatriation exercise and appealed to the state government to give all necessary support.
