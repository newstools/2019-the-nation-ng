The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has uncovered a smuggling depot of petroleum products in a Fulani settlement in a rural village in Mubi South Local Government Area in Adamawa State. The Adamawa State Controller of DPR, Alhaji Ibrahim Ciroma, who led a team on a tour to filling stations, was shocked when he got to a filling station opposite the settlement, located near the Republic of Cameroon boarder, only to find that it was a smuggling depot. The owner of the settlement ran into the bush on citing the DPR team, leaving DPR’s Ciroma lamenting the presence of the illegal depot despite nearby security checkpoints. “Just look at a Customs checkpoint there with their men on duty, see a military checkpoint 10 meters from here and here is a smuggling depot of petroleum products. What is the essence of all the Customs checkpoints we met on the road on our way here and see another Customs checkpoint 50 meters away from this place,” he said. Also in the course of the DPR tour, Ciroma said while sealing off a filling station owned by a state lawmaker, that his fight against smuggling of petroleum products in Adamawa State will not spare anybody. He stressed that those involved in sharp activities would soon face the full wrath of the law. “I have written the police and civil defense officials over the illegal filling stations operating in the state and I directed them to demolish them all since they are all illegal structures in the eyes of DPR laws,” he said.
