A socio-political group, the Edorisiagbon Network, has urged Chief John Odigie-Oyegun to stop heating up the polity and played the father figure to douse tension in the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress. it said the attack on Comrade Adams Oshiomhole by Chief Oyegun was out of place. The group said it has begun embarking on holding meetings with all the principal actors for resolution of the crisis. A statement by President of the group, Chief Idahosa Ray Amasowomwan, said the Edo APC crisis was complicated by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Chief Amasowomwan said the Machiavellic inauguration of minority rule at dead hours of the 17th of June was against all relevant sections of Nigeria’s constitution and established moral culture of Edo people. He said, “Chief John Odigie Oyegun has been fanning the embers of discord, disloyalty and utter irresponsibility against the National Working Committee of the ruling APC. “We can’t side a Governor who out of his desperation to cloth his abuse of due process, alleged crass mismanagement of State resources wickedly sidelined 15 members from inauguration. Edo people were not brought up that way, it is thus an alien culture.“ Also, the Ezomo of Benin Kingdom, Chief Okponmwense Ezomo urged all parties in the crisis to comply with whatever decision the National Assembly come out with to resolve the crisis in the Edo State House of Assembly. Chief Ezomo, in a statement made available to journalists in Benin, likened the crisis to the biblical case of the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob. He said, “I see an invisible hand mesmerizing the Edo State House of Assembly. Edo State remains a peace loving state as the role the Oba of Benin has played lately speaks volumes. I am of the opinion that the cards need to be reshuffled again for the sake of peace and so give credence to the revelations of the two senior houses in Abuja and as well as their projections”
