2019 CBN Open Wheelchair quarter-finalist, Kayode Alabi is preparing in earnest to be part of Nigeria contingent to the 2020 Paralympics games in Tokyo. The Ogun state born athlete, who lost to the eventual winner, Alex Adewale, at the 41st CBN Open in Abuja, is in full gear for the Paralympics. The 31-year old was part of 2018 Puma Engineering Wheelchair tennis IT tour in Abuja, where he lost in the quarterfinal, but won a bronze in the mens double. Earlier this year, at the Nairobi Open, an ITF future tournament, Alabi lost in the quarterfinals in both the Men’s Singles and Men’s Doubles. In a chat with NationSport, Alabi, who revealed that Pastor Murphy Eyenike from Daystar Christain Center has being behind his recent revival in his career, said he needed more support to achieve his dreams. “I am training day and night to be part of the 2020 Paralympics, I am putting all things together to make sure I qualify but I need more sponsors to achieve my target,” he said.
