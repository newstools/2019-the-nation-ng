It was all fun and games over the weekend as plantain lovers in Lagos gathered at The Patio, Ediye Limited, Lekki Phase 1 for the July edition of Plantain Lovers Connect dubbed ‘PLC’ The event which was organised by Dodo Gang, a creative house uniting plantain lovers through food, fashion, arts and events, saw plantain lovers engage and interact with themselves in a variety of board and card games. There was also a plantain menu filled with a variety of plantain dishes for guests to order from. The highlight of the event was the eating competition which saw teams of plantain lovers compete against each other to discover the first team to finish a jar of plantain chips. The event was a successful fun-filled one and we will definitely be on the lookout for Dodo Gang’s future events.
