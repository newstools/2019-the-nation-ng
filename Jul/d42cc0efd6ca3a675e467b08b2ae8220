The Orosuen of Okere-Urhobo Kingdom in Warri South council area of Delta state, His Royal Majesty, Professor Paul Oghenero Okumagba, Idama II, is dead. The Nation gathered that the royal father, who received his staff of office from the Delta state government less than a year ago, joined his ancestors on Monday, after what a source linked to a protracted illness. Although, the Okere-Urhobo palace has not released any official statement on the demise of the monarch, sources close to the palace, who spoke under anonymous conditions, revealed that chiefs and leaders of the kingdom would be meeting in the palace on Friday on the matter. When reached for confirmation, the Otota (traditional Prime Minister) of Okere-Urhobo Kingdom, Chief Wilson Eboh, seemed not to be in a mood to break the news to the media as he shouted on our correspondent who called to speak with him. The departed monarch ascended the throne of his fathers in October 2017, when he was picked by the kingdomâ€™s kingmakers as Orosuen-elect. His reign was formalised in November 2018, when he was presented with a staff of office by the state governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, who was represented by his deputy, Mr. Kingsley Otuaro. The late king was a renowned Professor of Sociology at the Delta State University, Abraka, before he was assigned to carry on with the responsibility of leading Okere-Urhobo Kingdom. The late Orosuen ascended the throne about six years after the passing away of his predecessor, His Royal Majesty, Benjamin Okumagba.
