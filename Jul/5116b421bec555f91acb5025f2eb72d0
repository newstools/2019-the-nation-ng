The Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu has ordered the immediate beef-up of security in all the States of the Federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. Zonal Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) and Commissioners of Police (CPs) across the country have also been mandated to ensure that customized security arrangements are put in place in their Area of Responsibilities (AORs) to checkmate the activities of criminals and any possible threat to public peace. The Police chief said the order is imperative following the series of violent protest and unrest by members of the El-zazakky group in the FCT. This is contained in a statement in Abuja on Friday by the Force Spokesman, DCP Frank Mba. The IGP also assured citizens that proactive measures including aerial surveillance of major cities have been emplaced to ensure the safety and security of lives and property of all Nigerians. Adamu however urged citizens to be wary of circulating unsubstantiated security advisories capable of creating undue fear, panic and apprehension in the country. He also advised all intending protesters to ensure they express their grievances within the ambit of the law so as not to infringe on the constitutional rights of other citizens or cause breach of public peace.
