The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has concluded plans to unbundle some Area Commands to create room for greater efficiency in the service. From the exercise, eight new Customs Area Commands will be created to enhance administration and boost revenue generation. A circular signed by the Deputy Comptroller-General of Customs (DCG) in charge of Finance, Administration and Technical Services (FATS), Aminu Dangaladima, explained that the approval for the unbundling was granted at the 50th Regular Meeting of the Nigeria Customs Service Board held May 21, 2019. The Area Commands so unbundled and created includes  Murtala Mohammed International Airport Area Command, created from MMAC with  Headquarters at MMIA; Ogun II Area Command, created from Ogun Area Command with Headquarters in Abeokuta; North Eastern Marine Command, created from Eastern Marine Command with Headquarters in Makurdi and Kaduna Area Command created from Kaduna/Katsina Area Command, with Headquarters in Kaduna. Others are Kebbi Area Command crated from Sokoto/Kebbi/Zamfara Area Command, with Headquarters at Birnin-Kebbi; Kwara Area Command created from Niger/Kwara/Kogi Area Command, with Headquarters at Ilorin; North Western Marine Command, created from Western Marine Command with Headquarters at Lokoja and Port-Harcourt Oil and Gas FTZ Area Command, created from PHC I Area Command with Headquarters at Onne, Rivers State. Also, the Service has approved the elevation of the Service’s Command and Staff College to Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) to be headed by a DCG. The upgrading to TRADOC, which was also approved at the May 21 meeting, is said to be in line with present management’s agenda of a holistic reorganization of the NCS.
