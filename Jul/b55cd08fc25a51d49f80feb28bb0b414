52-year-old travel agent, Lamidi Muis, was on Monday arraigned at a Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly obtaining N1.3 million from a client on the pretext of procuring Australian visa for him. Muis is facing a five-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining by false pretences. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said that the defendant committed the offence last month in Apapa, Lagos. She said the defendant stole the money of the complainant, Mr. Uthman Musbau, given to him through an electronic transfer for his travel logistics. According to him, the defendant had promised to procure an Australian visa, a flight ticket and hotel reservation for Musbau, but failed to do so. Olaluwoye said the defendant forged a visa and flight ticket and gave them to the complainant. “My lord, it was at the airport that the complainant discovered that the ticket and visa were fake. “He was seriously embarrassed and was almost arrested at the airport for trying to travel with a fake ticket and visa. “Musbau reported the case to the police, and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendant N2 million bail with two sureties each in the like sum. She said one of the sureties must be a relation of the defendant and should live within the court’s jurisdiction. Oghere ordered that the sureties must be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on August 7.
