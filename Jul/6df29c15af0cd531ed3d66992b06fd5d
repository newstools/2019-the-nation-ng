A 49-year-old man, Ogunkeye Oyewole, has been brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly assaulting a female police sergeant. He pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of breach of the peace and assault. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Clifford Ogu said the defendant committed the offence on July 18 at Ajegunle, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by assaulting Sergeant Blessing Familokun while she was performing her duty. “The defendant’s wife went to the station to report him for beating her up mercilessly. “When the policewoman followed the complainant to her house to invite the defendant, he beat her up too,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate J. A. Adegun granted the defendant N50,000 bail with one surety, who should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on August 9.
