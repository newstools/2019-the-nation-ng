The Acting Administrator, Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), Lagos, Campus, Viola Askia Usoro, yesterday said over 54 per cent of business organisations in the country suffer cyber-attacks. DBI is the manpower development arm of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). Speaking during the closing ceremony of 2019 English West and Central Africa Instructor Event in Lagos, she said a huge percentage of the cyber breaches were due to human errors. She said: “It is quite commendable that school Cisco is focused on providing capacity and awareness in cybersecurity which is an unavoidable tussle in today’s world. The internet has become an essential part of our daily activities. Statistical indicators show that more than half of the world’s population uses the internet thereby generating about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data on a daily basis.” According to her, NCC  industry statistics showed that the number of internet users is about 119.5 million as at April 2019. “Despite the slow start, internet use is growing exponentially in Nigeria. While huge amounts of data are useful in a number of fields such as banking, medicine, communications, government, education etc, it is it also poses unprecedented threats for users security and privacy. In Nigeria the vast majority of the communications infrastructure resides in private hands. The risks to national and economic security associated with the compromise of failure of these assets mean that their protection requires concerted public-private effort,” she added. She said the regulator and key industry stakeholders have been working together to foster and implement a robust cyber security environment for effective ICT infrastructure security management as well as data protection and privacy.
