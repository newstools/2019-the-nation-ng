Five people were killed after a minivan and a pickup vehicle collided on a toll road in Indonesia’s West Java province, police said on Saturday. The accident occurred at 23:00 p.m. Jakarta time on Friday at Cikopo-Palimanan toll road, police chief of Majalengka District Mariyono said. “The driver of the pickup lost control of the car which crossed into the opposite lane and collided with the minivan. “It was predicted that the driver of the pickup vehicle was sleepy so his vehicle crossed into the opposite road lane,’’ Mariyono was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying in West Java province. He said the two vehicles caught fire after the collision and killed five people aboard. Mariyono added that all the victims had been identified. (Xinhua/NAN)
