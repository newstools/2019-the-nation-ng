Battle from one arch rival to another, that perhaps captures the case of Eight-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer as he aims to claim a 9th one on Sunday. The 37 year old overcame Rafael Nadal in the semifinal to set up another clash with world number one Novak Djokovic The Swiss can clinch a record-extending 21st major if he manages to break free of the world No. 1’s stranglehold. Four-time Wimbledon winner and defending champion Djokovic enjoys a 25-22 edge in career meetings, stretching back 13 years. The Serb has won 14 of their last 20 meetings and eight of the last 10. Federer has lost all four of their most recent meetings at the Slams and it’s now seven years since he triumphed over the 32-year-old at the majors. That was 2012 in four sets in a Wimbledon semi-final. However, Federer, who will be 38 next month, insists such statistics are meaningless as he attempts to succeed Ken Rosewall, at the 1972 Australian Open, as the oldest Slam champion of the Open era. “It’s been a rock solid year for me. I won in Halle [on grass on the eve of Wimbledon]. The stars are aligned right now,” said Federer.“ From that standpoint, I can go into the match very confident.” Federer, who passed the 100-win mark at Wimbledon in his quarter-final victory over Kei Nishikori, is feeling especially confident after seeing off Rafael Nadal in four sets in the semi-final. That win was crucial coming as it did just a month after his old rival had condemned him to his worst Slam loss in 11 years in the semi-finals at Roland Garros. Appearing in his 12th final at the All England Club, and 16 years after his maiden Wimbledon title triumph, Federer believes there is little new that either he or Djokovic can do to prepare for Sunday’s showdown. “This is like at school — on the day of the test you’re not going to read, I don’t know, how many books you can read that day.
