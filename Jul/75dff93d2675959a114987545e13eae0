NOT a few Ogun indigenes hailed the move as laudable two years ago when the Senator Ibikunle Amosun-led administration announced the conversion of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic to Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology. But two years down the line, it has become a white elephant project, draining the purse of the state government so much that Governor Dapo Abiodun is now seeking the nod of the Ogun State House of Assembly to revert the institution to its original name and status. For two years, the university, with a Vice-Chancellor and a Governing Council in place, has been drawing salaries without really taking off. An insider said the truth is that the state government did not really have enough money to fund a unniversity of science and technology, but the immediate past governor of the state insisted on the project in order to score some cheap political points. In a letter dated July 18, which Governor Abiodun forwarded to the House of Assembly, he called for an amendment of the bill that established the university. Sentry gathered that the move had caused serious anxiety in the university as the staff of the still born institution face uncertain future.
