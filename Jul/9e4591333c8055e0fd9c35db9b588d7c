PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari spoke from a sincere heart at the luncheon he had with National Assembly members on Thursday when he admitted that he was under intense pressure over the appointment of ministers for his new cabinet. Investigation conducted by Sentry revealed that the jostle for ministerial posts is at fever pitch in states with serious clash of interests among leading political figures. In one particular state, for instance, three prominent political figures are backing different candidates for the stateâ€™s only ministerial slot, and none of them is ready to yield ground on the issue. Already, there are fears among observers in the know of the development that it could trigger a crisis that would be difficult to manage. The interest of former governors appears to have compounded matters. Many of them have joined the fray in many states, lobbying intensely for a slot in the ministerial list. Many have even relocated to Abuja while others are pressing buttons from abroad. The people in the Presidential Villa are said to be amused by the development as nobody is sure of anything.
