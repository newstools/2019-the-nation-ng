A faction of Oyo State African Democratic Congress (ADC) has distanced itself from  the purported withdrawal of the party’s candidate in the last election, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, from the alliance with the People’s Democratic Party ( PDP). The faction said the ADC, its teeming members and supporters across the state are solidly in support of the governor, “believing that we are on the same page.”. A letter addressed to the state governor of the state, Seyi Makinde and signed by the former secretary to the state government, on behalf of the party, Chief Busari Adebisi. Stakeholders of the party have not abandoned the original leitmotifs, especially good governance for the people of the state which was the bases of the alliance.” The statement reads: “Following the recent political development in Oyo state, as it affects the purported withdrawal of senator Olufemi Lanlehin from the African Democratic Congress  coalition with your government, I am compelled to make the following observations; that the prime motive of bringing ADC to Oyo State, was to ensure the termination of the eight-year agonizing rule of the APC administration and importantly to ensure that the administration does not succeed itself by other means, so as to free the good people of Oyo State from the regrettable APC’s socio-economic bondage. “Another reason for the ADC was to participate and ensure the emergence of a credible alternative to Ajimobi’s  lackluster administration in the state. As it is customary in such political arrange, nets, the parties in the coalition usually agree on a set of conditions, the basis of which they go into elections together. The summary of the agreement reached with the PDP for our party was 30 percent participation in government. “Without prejudice to the above observations, I wish to unequivocally declare to you that our party, the ADC, its teeming members and supporters across Oyo State are solidly in continued support of your government, believing that we are still on the same page.”
