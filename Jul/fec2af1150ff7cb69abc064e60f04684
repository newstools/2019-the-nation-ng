In line with its commitment to foster social impact and sustainable development in Nigeria, FBNQuest Merchant Bank, the investment banking and asset management subsidiary of FBN Holdings Plc has announced a SPARK initiative, to celebrate the third edition of its corporate responsibility & sustainability week recently. The initiative is also part of activities in celebration of FirstBank’s 125th anniversary in Nigeria. SPARK– which represents ‘Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness’ was created to empower people within the business communities and create a positive multiplier effect that can impact the nation. Employees from FBNQuest Merchant Bank were encouraged to show compassion, empathy and giving, which were reflected in the key activities organised by the Bank throughout the CR&S week. The week kicked off with a visit by employees of FBNQuest Merchant Bank, to Girls Senior Secondary Grammar School Ikoyi, to educate students about the SPARK values, which includes compassion, civility, charity and connection. The organisation recognises that exposing children to such important ethics would help them cultivate better life habits which can create ripple effects, to make the world a better place. Employees also raised funds for the Bethesda Child Support Agency through its “Lend a Helping Hand” initiative, to empower Orphans and vulnerable children by providing them access to formal education. The group also donated relief items to Halal Children’s Home and Anawim Catholic Home located in Abuja and Global Foundation for Orphaned Children in Port Harcourt. To round off the CR&S week, FBNQuest Merchant Bank organised a Financial Literacy Session for Widows, which held at the International Women’s Society Secretariat.
