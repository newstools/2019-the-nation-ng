Residents of Calabar, the Cross River State capital, are counting their losses following a two-day rainfall that caused flooding in many parts of the city. The rain, which fell steadily since Wednesday morning until Thursday, flooded homes leaving many stranded. Fortunately no life has been reported lost. Among areas worst hit was the Cross River University of Technology (CRUTECH) Staff Quarters where the residents urged the government to intervene in the perennial problem. Other areas affected by the problem in Calabar South include Target, Ebito, Atu, Musaha, Murray, Nelson Mandela, Yellow Duke Streets and even farmlands at Anantigha. In Calabar Municipality affected areas include Asari Eso, Akai Effa, Essien Town, Murtalla Mohammed Highway, State Housing Estate, Efio-Ette junction, Parliamentary Extension among others. Though Calabar has the advantage that the water goes down soon after the rain stops, residents still lost property worth millions of naira and have begged the government to ensure something is done to permanently check the problem. Director General of the State Emergency Management Agency, Ayim Princewill, urged those living in the flood prone areas to move to higher grounds. He said the government is working towards preventing such occurrences. He said they had contacted the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to get relief materials and are working towards alleviating the plight of those affected. “We can’t fight nature but only apply mitigation measures to handle the situation, he said.
