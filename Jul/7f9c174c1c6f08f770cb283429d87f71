SERENA Williams has stated that passion is what pushes her to keep playing tennis at the highest level. For the American, it’s everything. “I absolutely would not be here if I didn’t love what I do. I work really hard at what I do every day. So, yeah, it’s hard to do something for this long if you don’t have a true love for it. I think it’s been consistent. I think in the past few years it gets to be a lot more, which is really intense.” Asked an opinion about the age eligibility as Cori Gauff, who has reached the fourth round, can play only a certain amount of events at 15 years of age, Serena added: “I don’t know. “I can’t really comment on that because I can’t really experience that. I do know when I was younger, I was limited to tournaments. I also was able to go to school and be able to do things that I’ll never get back. “I don’t know. I don’t know what to say about it.” Asked what made her decide to play mixed doubles with Andy Murray, Serena added: “We talked about it a little bit before. It made sense for me because I really could use some matches at this point. “It made sense for him. We both want to do well. We both love Wimbledon. Yeah, so it was definitely something that we thought we could do. I think Andy is a great player like I said. I think he is mentally one of the toughest players out there. I don’t even know what goes on in his mind. I know what goes on in mine, my mind. It’s always interesting to hear what other champions think, how you can play that to your game — apply it to your game. It’s only a win-win situation for me.
