The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) on Tuesday said it had spent over N500 million on establishing Redeemer’s College of Technology and Management (RECTEM). The church said it needed at least N1.2 billion more to upgrade and expand existing facilities and provide new ones for RECTEM’s next academic session, which will begin in September. RECTEM’s Governing Council Chairman, Pastor Johnson Odesola, who spoke in Lagos at the college’s official public presentation ceremony, implored Nigerians to help fund the dream to produce out world-class technologists. Odesola explained that the institution was part of the RCCG’s effort to partner the government to fill the “huge gap in technical education development” in the country. He said: “Technical education development is at its lowest ebb, with the sorry state of many of our national polytechnics, which are seriously lacking in critical facilities, laboratory and workshop equipment with the graduates very deficient in expertise when compared with their counterparts elsewhere. “More worrisome is the fact that we have neglected the training of workmen and masonries across the professions, particularly in civil works and building, thereby making the quality of our construction very poor. “The attendant negative effect is that we have to import this kind of manpower from neighbouring countries in preference for Nigerians, thereby putting more pressure upon an already depressed economy.” Odesola regretted that despite expending over N500 million on buildings, facilities and equipment, more still needs to be done.
