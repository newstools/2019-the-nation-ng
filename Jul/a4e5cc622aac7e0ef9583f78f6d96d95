Former Zamfara Governor, Abdul’aziz Yari, on Monday defended his handling of the security situation in the state, saying he did his best to tackle the problem. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Yari made the remarks in Talata-Mafara at a meeting of All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders from Gusau, Maradun and Tsafe local government areas. “I am using this opportunity on behalf of the entire APC members in Zamfara state to condole people of Maradun and Tsafe local government areas over recent bandits’ attacks in their communities. “We pray to Almighty Allah to grant the deceased Aljannatul Firdausi and give their families the fortitude to bear the loss. “You know, during my administration I tried my best to tackle the problem though some people were accusing us thinking that we have not done well to address the problem. “We are not saying this because we are happy with what is happening, but people should avoid judgement based on personal or political interests. “As I always say, the issue of security is beyond political or personal interest, we should support President Buhari in fighting banditry in the state”, the former governor said. Yari also appealed to people of the state to continue to pray and seek for Allah’s interventions to end the problem. In his remarks during the meeting, the Chairman of Maradun Local Government, Alhaji Ahmad Abubakar said the security challenges in the area had escalated. According to him, several communities have been attacked in the last one month, with the attacks occuring daily throughout last week. His counterpart of Tsafe local government area, Alhaji Aminu Mudi thanked the former governor over his concern for the people of the state.
