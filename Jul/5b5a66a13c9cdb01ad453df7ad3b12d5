PROPERTY mogul and chief executive of Gibraltar Construction, Sir Olu Okeowo, seizes every available opportunity to prove his love for his wife, Adejoke. Apart from his white-coated Victorian styled edifice in Ikoyi, Lagos, the Knight of John Wesley is also believed to own more luxury properties around the city and elsewhere. But even more remarkable is the billionaire businessman’s closeness to his wife and mother of his three children. Okeowo is said never to travel abroad without his wife in tow. As a mark of his undying love for his wife, Okeowo stood solidly behind her on June 15 when his mother-in-law celebrated her 80th birthday. Mama Oluwafunmilayo Adewunmi enjoyed the besotted love Okeowo has for his wife as he rolled out the drums and ensured that nothing was spared to make the day a memorable one. The celebration started with a thanksgiving service at Our Saviour’s Church at Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, and was followed by a lavish reception at the Harbour Point, Victoria Island, Lagos, with hundreds of dignitaries in attendance.
