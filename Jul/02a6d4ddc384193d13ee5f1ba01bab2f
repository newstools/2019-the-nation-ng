As the House of Representatives extended the ultimatum it issued to Governor Godwin Obaseki for a fresh proclamation letter to be issued, the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, has reminded the lower chamber of the subsisting restraining order by a Federal High Court. Speaker Okiye who spoke to our reporter on the phone, described the extension as being “better for us.” Several residents of the state had thronged the House of Assembly since Wednesday to see if the police had actually shut down the House of Assembly following the expiration of the one-week ultimatum. There is however heavy security presence at the Assembly premises. According to Okiye, “They know the law is not on their side. They claim they are protecting democracy but they are destroying democracy by their actions. “I didn’t want to join issues with the House of Representatives because I see them as our elder brother, but we are guided by the rule of law. “We are not into any crisis in Edo and we have the capacity to manage ourselves.” One of the anti-Okiye members-elect, Barr. Washington Osifo, said he encouraged the House of Representatives to do what is best for the country and the people. Barr. Osifo said the lower chamber has a right to modify its motions. “They want to give opportunity to input the position of the Senate. The road to justice is slow but we must pass through it,” he said.
