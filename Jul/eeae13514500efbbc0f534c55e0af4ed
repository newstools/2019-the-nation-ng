The Modakeke Magistratesâ€™ Court in Osun on Wednesday ruled that Nwanle Friday, 26, be remanded in Ile-Ife prison for housebreaking. The court ordered that the defendant should be remanded in prison custody pending his bail.
The Prosecutor, Insp. Ona Glory, told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in June around 1.00 p.m. at J4 Village via Modakeke-Ife. Glory said that the defendant entered into the house of one Adejumo Rapheal with intention to commit felony therein to wit: stealing. He said that the defendant stole the cash sum of N1.4 million, property of one Adetunji Dada.
According to him, the offence contravened Sections 383, 390(9) and 412 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of housebreaking and stealing. The Defence Counsel, Mr Keji Adegoke, pleaded for the bail of the defendant in most liberal terms, pledging that his client would not jump bail and would provide reliable sureties. Magistrate Abimbola Famuyide did not grant the bail, but asked the counsel to come with written application for the consideration of the bail. Famuyide ordered the remand of the defendant in Ile-Ife Prison.
He adjourned the case until Aug. 1 for hearing. (NAN)
