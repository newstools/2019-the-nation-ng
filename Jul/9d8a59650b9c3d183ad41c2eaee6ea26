Ondo State Governor’s wife Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu on Wednesday in Akure, the state capital led women on a sensitisation walk against alarming rate of rape in the state. She called for legislations that would ensure stiffer penalties for rapists, child abusers and predators. The walk is coming on the heels of the high rate of rape and child defilement incidence in Ondo State, which has been a concern to Mrs.  Anyanwu-Akeredolu. The walk, which started at the palace of Deji of Akure, Oba Ogunlade Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo, spanned through to Oke Eda area of the town and it was reportedly done in all other 17 local government areas of the state. Mrs. Anyanwu-Akeredolu had a fortnight ago chaired a stakeholders’ meeting, where she frowned at how minors were being subjected to trauma in the hands of rapists and solutions were proffered on how rape could be nipped in the bud. The First Lady, who was represented by the Commissioner  for Woman Affairs,  Mrs. Titilayo Adeyemi, said the women were in palace to seek the monarch’s support and inform him that the menace of rape cases was worrisome to womenfolk. “Kabiyesi, we are here to inform the palace that the issue of rape is a great concern to everybody. We are tired of it and we are here to solicit the help of the palace. “When a minor is raped, it may cause premature death, sickness  and trauma. “There is high tendency for rape victims to develop unnecessary hatred to men, making such victims difficult to have good homes,” she said. She added that rape menace should be condemned by all and sundry, asking traditional institution to expose suspected rapists for proper punishment. Oba Aladetoyinbo applauded Mrs. Ayanwu-Akeredolu for taking the initiative to stop the menace of rape. The monarch, who condemned the menace, advocated life punishment for rapists. He added that all morally human beings should support the initiative and contribute to it.
