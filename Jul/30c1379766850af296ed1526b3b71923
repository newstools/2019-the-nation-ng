Rotary International District 9110 has rolled out projects for the New Year. It plans to wage war against the spread of cervical cancer, Congenital Heart Diseases and reduce extreme poverty among residents of Lagos and Ogun States. New District Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, stated this to reporters ahead of his official installation where funds will be raised to undertake key humanitarian projects for the new Rotary year. Akeredolu pledged to mobilise funds from volunteers within and outside the Rotary Circles to bring the projects to fruition. He hinted the cervical cancer prevention programme has become a priority to his administration, going by the alarming rate at which lives are being lost to the deadly disease in recent times. He also informed treatment of Congenital Heart Diseases which has continued to claim lives of many children, especially those from indigent families will be his focus. The District Governor said a significant proportion of funds raised during his tenure shall be devoted to addressing the needs of people in extreme poverty through empowerment programmes, using the existing Rotary Vocational Training Centre in Igbogbo, Ikorodu as a pool from where beneficiaries would be sourced. This, he said, will be in fulfillment of Rotaryâ€™s commitment to giving hope to the vulnerable people around the world. While reflecting on funding, he noted that N200 million is required for the various projects and programmes in his tenure. Part of this, he said, is to be raised via grant from the Rotary Foundation while well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies are expected to partner by donating cash or providing materials and logistic support. The installation, which comes up on Saturday 6th July 2019 at the Muson Centre, Lagos is to be graced by eminent personalities such as Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka, Dr. Reuben Abati and Lagos monarch Oba Rilwan Akiolu.
