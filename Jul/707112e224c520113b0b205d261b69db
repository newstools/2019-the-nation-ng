warships – NNS KARADUWA and EKULU – to celebrate the Ghanaian Navy’s
60th anniversary, will visit five other countries’ naval forces as it journeys
back to its base. According to Deputy Chief of Staff,

“This visit is to enhance security objectives between the two countries. We are
here in display of our friendship. We share a single purpose with the Nigerian
Navy and that is to enhance security, prosperity and make sure that trade and
commerce across the Gulf of Guinea is safe and secure. “So, that is why we want to partner with
Nigeria to enhance the security.” The Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) WNC Rear
Admiral Oladele Daji said relationship between both navies had been beneficial
and would be further cemented by the visit. Earlier, Daji received the NN delegation
from Ghana, which arrived the NNS BEECROFT jetty before midday. The ships departed Nigeria penultimate

successful flag showing visit. He urged the ships’ companies to
internalise experiences gained from the trip and pass the knowledge across the
fleet.
