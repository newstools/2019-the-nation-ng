The Agege Local Government is to hold a yearly essay competition for secondary school pupils to immortalize renowned columnist, the late Alhaji Kola Animashaun. Animashaun was former Chairman of the Editorial Board of The Vanguard. He lived in Agege for over 40 years. He died on May 30. He was 80. The council Chairman, Mr Ganiyu Egunjobi, who visited the bereaved family at their Adegbite Close, Dopemu, Agege home, on Sunday, said the competition would encourage reading by pupils. The council delegation was received by the widow, Alhaja Silfat Animashaun, her son, Adeboye and daughter, Mrs Opeyemi Sarumi. Egunjobi described the late Animashaun as an ambassador of Agege in whom everybody in the area was well pleased. “Alhaji Animashaun was a journalist par excellence, a fine gentleman, a conscientious and decent person, who was committed to the development of Nigeria and bestrode the media like a colossus. His write-ups were insightful, inspiring and for some of us, it was a weekly tonic. “He personified piety and professional excellence. It is my hope that many of us can replicate him and stay on the straight and narrow path,” he said. Egunjobi added: “We are happy that he did not die unsung. On our part at the council, we have come up with an annual essay competition to immortalise him. It will be contested by public junior secondary school pupils in Agege every July 5 on his posthumous birthday anniversary. “Apart from immortalising the late doyen of journalism, the other aims are: to encourage reading culture, creative writing among school children and recognise hard work and talent of aspiring young writers.” Responding, Adeboye said: “We truly appreciate your effort at immortalising Alhaji Animashaun; accept our gratitude for deeming it worthy to confer enduring fame on him.”
