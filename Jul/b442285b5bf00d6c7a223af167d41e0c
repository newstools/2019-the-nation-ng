Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) on Saturday condemned the murder of Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of elder statesman Pa Ruben Fasoranti. The group urged the Southwest  leaders to rise to the challenge of increasing insecurity in the region. ARG, in a statement by its chairman, Olawale Oshun, said the onus is on the governors in particular to rise to the occasion. He said: “We share in this colossal loss and condole with the bereaved family, especially Pa Fasoranti and Mrs. Olakunrin’s nucleus family. This loss is a burden too heavy and a steep price to pay for steadfastly serving this nation and our people. “Mrs. Olakunrin’s death at the hands of these savage herdsmen could not but have been part of a grand plan to break the soul of Yorubaland and set the roof on fire. But the fire this time will consume the perpetrators and their collaborators.” According to the group, Yoruba governors and the socio-political leadership zhould actcwith speed because it is now evident that the Central government and its Central Policing System clinging have failed woefully to guarantee security. Oshun added: “Our governors must realise that they shall be held responsible, individually and collectively, should they fail to prioritise and support one another in securing their people. The time to act is now. “Mrs Olakunrin’s is the latest victim of Nigeria’s wobbling and ineffective unitary governance structure. “The gory stories of kidnapping, maiming, raping and killing that emanate daily from Yoruba land should be stopped by whatever mean possible  including pursuing the dismantling of this unworkable unitary constitution and replacing it with a truly Federal Constitution. “The time for our governors to stand up on our behalf is now, they can count on the support of our people in their bid to drive out  these senseless criminals from our land. “It is only by doing this that Mrs. Olakunrin and all those murdered by these beasts would not have died in vain.”
