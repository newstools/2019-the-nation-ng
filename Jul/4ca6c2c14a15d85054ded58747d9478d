David Okereke has not wasted time to justify his record transfer to Club Brugge when he scored on his league debut for the Belgian club to win 3-1 at Waasland-Beveren. Okereke started Saturday’s game and gave his side a 2-1 lead in the 48th minute when he fired in from close range, from a rebound after the goalkeeper dropped a shot. The Nigeria U23 striker, who cost Club Brugge a record 8million Euros, said the coach told him what he wanted at the interval. “During the break, the coach told me that I had to attack the ball more in the first post. That’s where the passes came,” he said. “I am happy with my goal and the victory for the team is great. Whether this is a relief? No, not really. With one goal you can’t be relieved, you have to do more than that. “I only arrived in Bruges not too long and I still have tactical work, but things are going well. “The coach works hard every day to make us play beautiful football. You saw that back a bit in the game.”
