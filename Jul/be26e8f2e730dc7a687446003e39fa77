Reigning Commonwealth champion, Nigeria’s Odunayo Adekuoroye has set a gold medal target for herself at both the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and next month’s Africa Games billed for next month in Morocco. In a chat with NationSport, the World wrestling silver medalist, who won gold in her 57kg category at the Yasar Dogu Ranking Series event held in Istanbul, Turkey, said he aim is to become the best in her category. The Ondo State-born wrestler says she needed more financial supports from government, individuals and private sector in order to achieve her target. “Like I used to say, hard work pays. I work very hard, with my coach, working on my weak and strong areas. I know expectations keep rising towards the Africa Games this year and the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and I believe by the special grace of God I will win gold for Nigeria at both competitions. “I want to use this opportunity to ask for assistance from the federal government, private companies, individuals, most especially the Governor of my state, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State. I really need their support financially towards my Olympic quest. “I want to say thank you to all the people behind my success. My father in the Lord, the General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministries, Dr. Daniel Olukoya and his wife, President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Hon Daniel Igali, my coach Akur Purity, they are the best. To my family, my biological parents, I love you very much. To my fans all over the world, thanks for believing in me, thanks for your support, I really appreciate. I believe with my performance at the last World Ranking Series in Istanbul, Turkey, I will be one of the best in my weight class,” the world No. 4 wrestler told NationSport.
