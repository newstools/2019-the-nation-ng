 Ahead of round of 16 clash between Madagascar and DR Congo on Sunday, citizens of the Island nation have declared operation pray for the national team even as many have vowed to make it the first prayer point on Sunday in church. The Barea who are debutants to the 62 year old African Nations cup sent their countrymen and women to cloud nine not only by impressive run in the group stage but by doing it in style including beating highly rated Super Eagles 2-0 and topping the group enroute the round of 16. Should they succeed in overcoming DR Congo on Sunday in Alexandria, they would have hit the Quarterfinals at the first attempt. The country’s 25 million people are caught up in suspense as they await the team’s last-16 match on Sunday against the Democratic Republic of Congo who can indeed be dubbed veterans of the Nations with 18 appearances and two titles in the kitty won in 1968 and 1974 respectively. The Congolese have also been quarterfinalists five times and third place finishers once, an intimidating credential going into Sunday’s clash with Madagascar. A die-hard Barea supporter told AFP “Everyone is now enthusiastic because the team has shown us that defeat is not inevitable and that we can achieve feats with effort and perseverance. Today, there are no longer some people who are fans of the game, and some who are not — all Madagascans have become supporters. Since the start of the tournament, shops close early and streets in Antananarivo are reportedly deserted for every game “We have never known this in the history of our country,” said Donna Andrianirina, an accountant in the capital. “On Sunday, my morning schedule is to go to church to pray for victory.” Only few days back an appreciative President Andry Rajoelina approved the hiring of a plane to convey fans to Egypt to support the team.
