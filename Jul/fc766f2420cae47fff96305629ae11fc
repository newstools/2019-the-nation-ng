Sheraton Hotels Lagos and Abuja have announced that the hotels will celebrate the Lasagna Day in the month of July and also offer Italian cuisines to their guests. The Area General Manager for Marriott Hotels in Nigeria, Barry Curran, said: “For our valued guests visiting in July, our Sheraton Lagos Hotel teams have come up with a line- up of delightsome and inspiring culinary options; one such activity is the commemoration of the World Lasagna Day. “On  July 29, the hotels will mark the World Lasagna Day  where all guests who dine at our Italian restaurant will get a portion of lasagna with every order that they make. We believe that by doing this, everyone will get a chance to taste this delicacy which our chefs are renowned for. “For our little tots, we are delighted to offer every child who checks in with their parents or dines during Sunday brunch, two inspiring coloring sheets to keep them busy. At the end of their stay or meal, the children get to put one of their colouring sheets on the hotels children board of fame, while they keep the other one. The coloured sheets get to stay on the board for a month where the kids can see it and feel proud each time they visit. “At Sheraton Abuja Hotel, Lasagna Day will equally be a special one as our teams will celebrate this day at our bustling Pool Bar and  Restaurant. We encourage all families and friends to sit back, relax and be inspired by the ambience at the pool side while you share a meal and catch up with loved ones.
