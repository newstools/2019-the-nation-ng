Ecobank Nigeria has organised a wealth-building and sustainance breakfast forum for its High Networth  Individual (HNI) customers. The lender  used the forum to pledge its commitment to helping its customers to sustain their family wealth, and ensure that their businesses transit from one generation to the other and have a better future for the children. Managing Director of the bank, Patrick Akinwuntan, said this during a breakfast forum for its premier customers in Lagos. He said, “We have experience across 36 countries in Africa and one of the key areas we identified is that in Africa, it is not that we don’t create wealth, the challenge is how to sustain and make sure that wealth moves from generation to generation. “And this is an issue across Africa and Nigeria being the power house of Africa, it is only appropriate that Ecobank in Nigeria brings together our premier banking customers, and have this kind of breakfast session, where we talk about the real issues. “We know that our clients know how to make money. We are here to support them to be able to expand the base of the wealth that they have. However, we know that our clients will like to see how that wealth transit from one generation to the other.” He said that was why it brought families who had been able to sustain the family wealth, as this could also help to sustain the country’s wealth. Country Head/ Chief Investment Officer, EDU Securities Wealth and Asset Management, Akinola Sowemimo, said: “We want all our customers in the Ecobank brand to be able to secure their future. There has not been enough education on the part of the customers on how to plan for the future, for their children among others”.
