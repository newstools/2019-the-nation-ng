THE four Turkish nationals abducted in Kwara State have regained their freedom. The construction workers were received yesterday by the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Kayode Egbetokun,six days after they were seized atÂ  a local bar at Gbale village in Edu Local Government Area of the state. They are Seyit Keklik (25), Yasin Colak (33), Ergun Yurdakul (35), and Senerapal (40). Egbetokun said the police worked round the clock with local vigilantes to secure the release of the victims. He said their effort paid off with the arrest of a member of the gang which kidnapped them on Thursday while another one was apprehended on yesterday. According to the police commissioner, this mounted pressure on the gang and forced them to release the captives unconditionally. He disclosed that the kidnappers initially asked for a ransom of N400 million and later reduced their demand to N100 million. Egbetokun, however, insisted that no ransom was paid for the release of the foreigners. He noted that three suspects have been arrested so far while others were at large. The police commissioner said the victims would be taken to Abuja after the doctor might have finished examining them.
