The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Kano
said the command in July seized over 702.063 kilogrammes of hard drugs. Commander Dr. Ibrahim Abdul, who briefed reporters on the
activities of the command this month, said: “Our fight against sales and
consumption of hard drugs has made Tramadol and other illicit drugs scarce in
Kano.” He said the agency arrested over 153 suspects with hard
drugs, adding that 25 of them were prosecuted and are serving sentences. Abdul said 72 cases are pending at the Federal High Court,
Kano, noting that the command is doing everything to ensure justice is done. “During the month under review, we seized 523.978 kilograms
of cannabis, 178.322 kilograms of psychotropic substance, three grams of
cocaine and 0.3 kilograms of heroin,” he said. Abdul said the command had also dislodged 35 hot spots
within and outside the metropolis. “They include Gwammaja Secondary School, Dan-agundi, Gwale
Cemetery, Abdullahi Bayero Road, Sabon Gari and Limawa-Hotoro.”
