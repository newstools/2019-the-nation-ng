THE United Nations cultural body UNESCO- yesterday added the Indian “Pink City” of Jaipur, the ruins Liangzhu City in China and the Plain of Jars located in central Laos to its World Heritage list. The additions followed a vote. The fortified commercial city of Jaipur was founded in the 18th century by Sawai Jai Singh II. It is built according to a grid plan and the Old City is painted uniformly in a distinctive terracotta hue. UNESCO also agreed in its morning session to add Bahrain’s Dilmun Burial Mounds, the Budj Bim wetlands landscape formed by Australia’s aboriginal Gunditjmara nation, the Mozu-Furuichi mounded tombs of Japan and the Dutch-colonial era Ombilin coal mining heritage of Indonesian Sumatra. Later on, the body recognised the Ore Mountains, which join the German region of Saxony with the Czech area of Bohemia, as a World Heritage site, along with the Roman-built water management system of the Bavarian city Augsburg and Poland’s Krzemionki prehistoric flint mines. Saxony Premier, Michael Kretschmer, gave his thanks for the recognition, labelling the project an example for international cooperation. This year, the UN committee is meeting in Baku, the capital of authoritarian-ruled Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea, to vote on a total of 36 applications. The gathering will last until July 10. Currently, there are over 1,000 cultural and natural sites from 167 countries on the list. On Friday, five sites including the ancient Iraqi city of Babylon were also added to the list.
