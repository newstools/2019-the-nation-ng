The Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu has assured members of the public that those who murdered the daughter of elder statesman, Chief Reuben Fasorantin will be found and prosecuted. The deceased, Mrs. Funke Olakunrin was allegedly killed by herdsmen. To ensure a full scale investigation, the IGP also noted that operatives from various units in the Force Headquarters have been deployed to Ondo State to commence massive manhunt for the killers with a view to tracking, arresting and bringing them to justice. The Units which are expected to work with the Ondo State Police Command Command includes; Special Forces and seasoned investigators from the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and the Technical Intelligence Unit (TIU). This is contained in a statement in Abuja on Saturday by the Force Spokesman, DCP Frank Mba. While condemning the heinous and barbaric crime, the IGP, as part of measures to prevent future occurrence, also ordered the total overhaul of security architecture on the highways straddling the Southern part of the country. The Commissioners of Police in the affected States were ordered by the IG to emplace adequate security arrangement in their areas of jurisdiction (AOR). The IG equally assured Nigerians that the Force Headquarters has perfected plans to replicate the special security arrangement powered by “Operation Puff Adder” currently ongoing in Kaduna- Abuja expressway in key highways in the Southern part of the country. The Police boss also reiterated the fact that the Force will not rest on its oars until sanity is restored in every nook and cranny of the country. He called for calm and support from all Nigerians, especially residents of Ondo State, in aid of the current investigation.
