Nigerian Breweries Plc has extended the deadline for the submission of entries for the 2019 Maltina Teacher of the Year award by two weeks. The entries, which had a deadline of July 12, can now be submitted until July 26. A statement by the Corporate Affairs Director, Mrs. Sade Morgan, noted that the deadline was extended due to calls from teachers for more time. She said: “We have received so many enquiries and pressure from participating teachers and other well-meaning individuals for the possibility to extend the entry deadline for this year’s edition of the Maltina Teacher of the Year initiative. This has further revealed to us that the initiative is highly regarded by our key stakeholders.” Mrs. Morgan urged primary and secondary school teachers in public and private schools to take advantage of the new window to complete their applications online or download forms to fill offline which can also be submitted by email. She added that forms were also available in various state Ministries of Education, Teacher Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) or Nigerian Breweries offices nationwide. Prizes to be won by the overall best in this year’s Maltina Teacher of the Year award include N6.5 million, a capacity training programme, and a block of classrooms at the teacher’s school. First and second runners-up will get N1 million and N750,000; while each state champion will receive a cash reward of N500,000 each.
