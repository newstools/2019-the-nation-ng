The All Progressives Congress (APC), Germany chapter, has dissociated itself from a report in the social media that it is campaigning for the re-election of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki. The chapter noted that the video was shared through a link of the Facebook page of Afrobizgermany Berlin, which leads directly to a YouTube page. The chapter alleged  that those behind the report were Ogbeide Osarumwense, who claimed  to be the chairman of APC in Berlin and Mr Fred Akoma. In a statement in Lagos, the chairman of the chapter, Olalekan Ogunwede, said: “We will like to categorically state that these men are neither members of the party in Germany nor have ever participated in any of the activities of the party in Germany. “It is also crucial to know that any form of state Diaspora Chapters is illegal and termed fraudulent according to the Mandate from the National Body in Nigeria.” He added: “APC Germany chapter is one of the twelve (12) accredited Diaspora chapters because we chose from the beginning to adhere strictly to the guidelines set by the leadership of our party. “Our chapter of the APC is a reputable chapter that is also registered under the German law with our structure and leadership in place. “Any statement not issued from the chapter’s secretariat with such degree of unprofessionalism as seen in that video purported to be from APC Germany chapter is fraud. “Anyone that does business with these men under the auspices of APC Germany Chapter should be warned that they do it at their own peril. This statement has been issued immediately we were alerted of the fraudulent act being perpetrated by these tricksters.
