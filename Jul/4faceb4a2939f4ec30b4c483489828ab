The Nigeria team finished 19th after it defeated Chile 34-26 in the last classification game at the IHF Men’s Junior (U21) World Championship in Spain. The Nigerian team dominated both half 14-10 and 20-16 for a cumulative score of 34-26 as the players celebrated the win in a competition, which stretched their resolve to the limit. The Nigerian players gave their all in all the games but were undone by size of the team and players. Coach Shittu Adewunmi said the team was happy to finish 19 considering that it was rated the least before the tournament. He also stated that the players played hard to ensure that they finish the competition on a high by beating Chile. He also stated that as an emerging nation in handball, the country should build on this performance and ensure that they do better in subsequent competitions. “This is the best result for Nigeria. Moreover, we are an emerging nation in handball, we are not yet top class. So it is a very good result for us. “Before the tournament, we were rated the least but today we have gone steps higher than that. We should also ensure that emphasis is placed on developing players with sizes, height and strength. While responding to why the team didn’t have the maximum number of players, President of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), Sam Ocheho stated that it has always been a struggle to attend international competitions without external funding. “It’s only in Spain that we had a depleted team and that it is because we don’t have external funding. The IHF trophy rules permits at least 14 players and three officials so every country will be there with same number.” “The HFN Board is determined to live up to its mandate while we would continue to appreciate your understanding and usual cooperation,” he added.
