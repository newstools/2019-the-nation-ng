The National Hajj Commission has warned intending pilgrims for this year’s hajj in Saudi Arabia against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus disease (MERS-Cov). Hajia Fatima Sanda Usara, Head, Public Affairs of the commission stated this in a statement released in Abuja Wednesday. “MERS,” she said, “is a deadly airborne viral infection with no known vaccine or definite medication.” “Sequel to a World Health Organization’s recent disclosure in Geneva that 14 cases of the viral infection have been recorded, pilgrims are advised to add their personal safety measures in protecting themselves. One of the ways of doing this is by always covering their noses and mouths with surgical masks, especially where there are large congregations of people,” the statement read. She also advised that pilgrims observe topmost personal hygiene all the time, particularly proper and constant washing of hands with soap. Alternatively, she recommended constant use of hand sanitisers, along with constant cleaning and disinfecting at all times. “Pilgrims are also advised to avoid touching their eyes, noses and mouths with unwashed hands. They are warned to avoid coming in contact with animals, camels especially,” she stated. They are also advised not to use personal utensils of infected persons or animals or directly take care of such persons (except they are qualified medical personnel), because the disease is normally passed through close contacts with affected persons or animals. Pilgrims are advised to immediately report any unusual fever accompanied with cough, shortness of breath and (or) pneumonia to the nearest health facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
