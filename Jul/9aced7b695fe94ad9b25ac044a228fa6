The country’s rich maritime resources are vital for the successful implementation of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said. He spoke in Lagos at a ceremony hosted by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to mark this year’s African Day of Seas and Oceans, with the theme, “Harnessing Nigeria’s marine biodiversity for accelerated economic growth.” Speaking to the theme,“Enhancing Africa’s role in a globally binding instrument on marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”, the Speaker pledged that the legislature would support efforts by the executive to ensure sustainable management of the country’s vast marine resources. The Director-General, NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, said the agency had sent six International Maritime Organisation (IMO) instruments to the Federal Government for ratification as part of efforts to ensure sustainable management of the marine environment.
