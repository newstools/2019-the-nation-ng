Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, on Friday expressed disappointment with the decision of the Federal Government to suspend the plan to build Ruga settlements in some states. He spoke with State House Correspondents after a closed door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Noting that his state had 200,000 hectares ready to donate to the federal government for the project, he said that the pastoralists deserve sympathy as the conflict is also affecting them.
