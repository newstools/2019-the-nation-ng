THE Medical College of Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti has said the institution will not rest on its oars in producing good medical doctors in view of its state-of-the art training facilities and quality manpower. The institution recently graduated the first set of medical students after 10 years of study due to delayed accreditation. Provost of the college, Prof. Kehinde Oluwadiya, said lack of funding which had been the reason for lack of accreditation for the college in the past, was now a thing of the past. Oluwadiya, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti at a news conference heralding the induction of the 43 pioneer doctors produced by the college, assured that there would not be a hitch in accreditation from the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) again. According to him, all the medical students that sat for final MBBS had “very good result as the students had 100 per cent passes and a distinction in surgery in the final examination. Overall, there were seven distinctions recorded by the graduating students in all the four professional examinations they sat for in the college”. According to the provost, the college curriculum ensured good quality medical doctors and the admission system is competitive, saying: “For instance, last year, over 700 candidates jostled for the 50 slots in the college.” He said Emeritus Professor of Pathology, Professor Williams Odesanmi, would on Monday deliver the induction lecture entitled: “Legal and ethical issues in medical practice” while the induction proper would take place later that day.
