Former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri on Thursday obtained his nomination and expression of interest form to contest the governorship primary of the APC in Bayelsa state with a warning to the party not to give the party ticket to just any candidate especially those with controversial background. Lokpobiri who became the first aspirant from the oil-rich state to obtain the form also said he was in support of the use of indirect primary for the selection of the party candidate in the state. There have been reports that a meeting of stakeholders in Bayelsa state called to decide the mode of primary ended in a deadlock with the camp of the former governor opting for direct primary. The former Speaker of Bayelsa state House of Assembly disclosed that he has no problem with the former governor of the state, Timiprieye Silva who is also gunning for the party ticket, but said he was better qualified to fly the party flag. He said majority of people in the state does not belong to any political party, adding that he has the ability to galvanise the people across political divide. Details shortlyâ€¦
