An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, has struck out the case instituted by the Deputy President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, (NULGE) in the state, Marcus Akinduko, against the bye â€“ election of Bola Taiwo as President of the union in the state. The bye-election followed the appointment of the immediate past President, Dr. Olubunmi Eniayewu as a Permanent Secretary in the state public service. Akinduko had in December, 2018 lost the election to Taiwo in the bye-election in line with the NULGE constitution. Dissatisfied with the election, Akinduko approached the High Court to seek an order to declare him the substantive State President of the union after the appointment of Eniayewu as a permanent secretary by the Ondo state government, adding that the bye-election was improper. But delivering judgement in the case, Justice Williams Akinturoye, held that the High court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case under the law. The NULGE President, Taiwo, said there was no victor, no vanquished in the judgement, adding that the verdict would spur him to continue to improve welfare of all local government workers in the state.
