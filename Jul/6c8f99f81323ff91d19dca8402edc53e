So, the essence of this movie is tell people out there that in whatsoever relationship they find themselves, Trust is important and essential” she said. Odumewu further added that lots of lessons will be learnt saying once there is trust, nothing can come in between a firm relationship/marriage but without trust in a relationship/marriage, there is no reason to form a union “When a relationship/marriage doesn’t have trust, it will always have problems.” After the premiere, Fiducia would be available on YouTube for streaming. Directed by Omoniyi Adeoba, Fiducia also stars actors including; Femi Akinyemi, Motunrayo Akofe and Lekan Alake . Odumewu, however, asked her fans to watch out for another project coming soon after Fiducia. “Something bigger and mightier than FIDUCIA is coming next. Already cooking, just keep your finger crossed and watch out. My best is yet to come” she said.
