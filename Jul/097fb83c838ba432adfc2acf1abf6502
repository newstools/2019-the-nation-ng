Former Minister for Works, Power and Housing Mr Babatunde Fashola has asked that everything be done to tackle organised crime. According to him, the country will be highly insecured, if the country fails to secure the today and tomorrow of its youths through proper planning and productive engagement. Fashola spoke at the third BRF-GABFEST programme, entitled: “Generational Gap: Youth Inclusion and the Leadership Question in Nigeria” in Lagos. The former Lagos State Governor said young Nigerians must continue to have positive mindsets about the country. Noting that education is critical to the process, he said that was the reason the present generation of young Nigerians must determine the type of education it wants for his children so that they could compete. Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said Nigeria needs to invest in education and create an enabling environment for the youth to thrive. Represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Dr Funmi Balogun, Sanwo-Olu enjoined the youth to fight for what they believe in, According to him, leadership is not by age but by knowledge, insight and responsibility. The governor said progress is being made with the election of youths as speakers in some states, adding that there is still a lot more to be done. During one of the panel discussions, a Nigerian artiste, Olubankole Wellington, popularly called Banky W, who contested during the last general election, said young people need to lose the sense of entitlement they own, as no one owes them. He said if the youth are serious, they need to take action, “stop complaining and put resources together to champion their cause as they have the figure.” According to him, there is a need for Nigerian leaders to have more young people around them and in their cabinet. He noted that politics is a game of number, yet Nigerian youth with their huge population had not used it to their advantage.
