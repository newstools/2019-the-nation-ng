Nollywood actress and producer, Funke Akindele, has announced her CSR work on promoting hygiene and good health in Nigeria through Dettol’s Clean Naija Initiative. She disclosed this on Silverbird TV breakfast show, ‘Today on STV’, where she discussed her career and motherhood. The ‘Jenifa’ creator also spoke on the need for better general health practices including daily hand hygiene which can prevent illnesses like diarrhoea, making families and communities healthier and happier. When asked what her partnership with Dettol means for Nigerians, Funke Akindele said: “Our goal is to get 20 million clean hands by the end of year 2020, and as such, I’d personally champion the promotion of proper personal hygiene in Nigeria. This is possible because, Dettol has products such as the antiseptic liquid, the anti-bacterial soap and hand sanitizer which will be instrumental to the achievement of our mandate.” She rounded up her time on the show by announcing the start of the National Handwash Challenge which is a social campaign that will help raise the consciousness of handwashing amongst active Nigerians.
