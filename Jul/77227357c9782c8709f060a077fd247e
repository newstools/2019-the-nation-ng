the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Prof Umar Dambatta, has said cybercrime will soon end in the country. He said punitive measures were being put in place to checkmate the trend. Dambatta addressed reporters in Kano after receiving an award of excellence at this year’s annual dinner and awards night alongside the wife of the governor, Dr Hafsat Abdullahi Ganduje and others. The event was organised by the Kabuga branch of Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE). The NCC chief said the activities of cybercrime were becoming worrisome. He said: “The Federal Government is putting in place all necessary measures to contain cybercrime, especially in our Banking sector and other areas in the country. “We are aware that cybercrime has a space file and measures have already been taken.” Dambatta said the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response team with a network of computers put together to contain cybercrimes was on the ground to protect the nation’s cyber space. The NCC chief and the team is domiciled in the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA). Other measures in place, he said, are in the Telecommunication sector, where another computer emergency team, called Cybercrime Incidence Response team, will be set up. Dambatta said: “We would see that these steps are being taken by the NCC as a further reinforcement of measures by government to checkmate cybercrime and nip it in the bud.”
