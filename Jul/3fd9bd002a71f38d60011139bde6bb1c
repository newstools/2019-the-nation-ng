No fewer than 11, 717 applicants in Kano State are currently undergoing screening for recruitment into the Nigeria Police Force. The screening exercise is being conducted at the Police Officers Mess on Miller Road in the Kano metropolis. The Police/Public Relations Officer for the Kano State Command, DSP Haruna Abdullahi, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Thursday. He said the screening, which commenced this week, would last for three weeks. Abdullahi said the applicants were from the 44 Local Government Areas of the state and were expected to undergo physical screening, in order to ascertain their physical and mental fitness. The Police spokesman said the applicantsâ€™ credentials would also be screened during the exercise, to ascertain the genuineness of their credentials. He said the screening, which would be conducted between July 1 and July 20, was currently going on smoothly and peacefully, as planned. Abdullahi said all those who missed the screening within the three-week stipulated period would be allowed to attend the exercise from July 21 to July 28. He, however, advised the applicants to ensure strict adherence to all the rules and regulations guiding the exercise as anybody caught violating the laws would be sanctioned. (NAN)
