The Inspector General of Police, Muhammadu Adamu, has assured that the killers of Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, will be apprehended and made to face the full weight of the law. He said the Police Command, backed by Special Forces and seasoned investigators from the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and the Technical Intelligence Unit (TIU) deployed from the Force Headquarters, Abuja, on his directives, have commenced a manhunt for the killers, with a view to  bringing them to justice. While condemning the heinous and barbaric crime, the IGP, as part of measures to prevent a future occurrence of such incidence, has ordered the overhaul of security architecture on the highways across the country. He said the Commissioners of Police in the affected states are to reinvigorate the security arrangement in their areas of jurisdiction. Adamu said the Force Headquarters have perfected plans to replicate the special security arrangement powered by “Operation Puff Adder” currently on-going in Kaduna- Abuja Expressway in the Southern part of the country. He reiterated that the police will not rest on its oars until sanity is restored in every nook and cranny of the country. Adamu called for support from all Nigerians, especially residents of Ondo State, in aid of the current investigation.
