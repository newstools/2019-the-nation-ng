A Federal High Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State Capital has dismissed the application filed by candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Mr. Olatunji Felder, seeking to nullify the victory of Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, representing Ondo South Senatorial District at the National Assembly. The court also awarded the sum of N200, 000 cost against Felder. Felder, from Oke-Igbo the same Local government with Tofowomo under Ileoluji/Okeigbo Local Government of Ondo State, took the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court over the conduct of supplementary election of March 9, 2019 by the commission. He alleged that INEC did not officially inform him by issuing 14- day notice before proceeding with the conduct of the supplementary election where he came distant third following the conduct of the election held in 56 polling units of Ondo South senatorial district. On February 23, Tofowomo polled 79,036 to defeat his closest rival Senator Yele Omogunwa of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, who scored 51,993 with vote margins of 27,036 and Felder of the AA coming behind Omogunwa. But the poll was declared inconclusive because the victory margin was less than the total votes cancelled in 56 polling units of four councils estimated at 28,300 votes which necessitated the supplementary election conducted by INEC. After the supplementary election, INEC Returning Officer for the district, Prof. Kayode Onifade, declared Tofowomo winner with 81,892 votes against Omogunwaâ€™s 55,610. But Felder, who came third, went to the Federal High Court in Alagbaka, Akure, to challenge the conduct of the supplementary election. Justice Folasade Olubanjo however struck out the case for lack of merit.
