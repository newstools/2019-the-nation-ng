Tourism Development expert, Ikechi Uko, has described the popular Jollof Rice War as not a serious dispute, but a marketing strategy designed to push African products across the globe. Uko, who disclosed this recently at the 5th edition of Accraweizo with the theme: ‘Seamless Travels in West Africa,’ urged film producers to always showcase African destinations while shooting their films. Uko added that there is need to promote the pyramid tourism in the African regions so as to generate the touristic traffic within the continent. “Today, the experienced part of tourism includes food, entertainment, music and dance. Think of how we can make tourism out of marriages, weddings and even funeral tourism. We can also tour and party in places like Ghana”, he said. Commenting, Acting Group Manager as well as Central Office Sun International, Didier Bayeye, stated that entertainment plays a very vital role in tourism. According to Bayeye, Sun International offers both leisure and business tourism. The GM said: “Meeting incentive, conference and events contribute by showcasing or exposing what the people or the destination has to offer”.
