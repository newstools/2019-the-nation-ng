There is need for concerted efforts in order to tackle the perennial power crisis in the country, Dr. Stefan Traumann, the Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany has said. The envoy spoke in Lagos during the 18th edition of seminar series on Renewable Energy Potentials in Nigeria. According to him, the convergence of conventional and renewable energy technologies, either grid-connected or decentralised can assure better system synergies and performances. “Inter connectivity and integration of various power systems with innovative storage technologies can bring about optimal results and transform the entire electricity value-chain if properly harnessed.” Echoing similar sentiments, the Deputy Head of Mission of the German Embassy, Abuja, noted that, “given the current state of the national grid, businesses must self-generate to keep afloat their commercial operations. “It is important that electricity tariffs within the Nigerian electricity supply industry be cost-effective. On the other hand, the need for improved efficiency in the industry cannot be overemphasised either.” In his remark at the seminar financed by the Foreign Energy Policy Fund of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AA), the Manager, Energy and Environment Desk, Delegation of German Industry and Commerce ((AHK,Nigeria), Olasunkanmi Akindele, observed that, the electricity industry is undergoing transformation at an unprecedented scale globally while advances in hybrid energy technology are expanding the possibilities of electricity generation, distribution and transmission. While making a case for hybrid power solutions, Akindele concluded that, “because hybrid power solutions integrate multiple generation sources, they bring about cost and system efficiencies, improve balance during downtime, and ensure energy security.”
