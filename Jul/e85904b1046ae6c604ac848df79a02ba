Nigeria’s three major quoted publishing companies have voted N210.67 million to be distributed to shareholders as cash dividend for the immediate past business year. In what indicated a major positive signal for the beleaguered publishing sector, University Press Plc, Learn Africa Plc and Academy Press stated that they would be paying dividends for the year ended March 31, 2019 despite declining margins in the industry. The three companies engage mainly in publishing, sales and distribution of educational books and materials. University Press, which has sustained unbroken decades of consecutive dividend payment, indicated that N64.71 million will be distributed for the 2019 business year, representing a dividend per share of 15 kobo. The board of Learn Africa has also recommended payment of N115.72 million as cash dividend to shareholders, representing a dividend per share of 15 kobo. Academy Press, which made the most remarkable recovery, indicated it would be distributing N30.24 million to shareholders, implying a dividend per share of 5.0 kobo. The dividend recommendation triggered a rally for Academy Press’ share price, which rose by 7.41 per cent to 29 kobo on the first trading session of this month. At a price of 29 kobo, the recommended dividend payout represents a dividend yield of 17.2 per cent, a yield considered attractive by most analysts. Key extracts of the audited report and accounts of the three companies for the year ended March 31, 2019 showed general decline in the bottom-line, underlining the cost pressure attributed to increasing costs of distribution and operations due to insecurity in some markets, proliferation of substandard publication, dumping and piracy. The 15-month report by Learn Africa showed that turnover rose to N3.48 billion in March 2019 as against N2.49 billion in December 2017. Profit before tax also rose from N296.69 million to N379.93 million. However, profit after tax dropped from N266.89 million to N161.96 million. Academy Press grew turnover by 12 per cent from N2.18 billion in 2018 to N2.43 billion in 2019. Profit before tax stood at N88.46 million in 2019 compared with a loss of N10.27 million in 2018. However, with taxes of N38.9 million in 2019 as against tax write backs of N73.91 million in 2018, profit after tax dropped by 22 per cent from N63.64 million in 2018 to N49.55 million in 2019. Earnings per share dropped from 17 kobo to 8.0 kobo. University Press grew its turnover from N1.80 billion in March 2018 to N2.316 billion in March 2019. Profit before tax however dropped from N354.63 million to N165.53 million while Profit after tax halved from N207.41 million to N109 million. Earnings per share consequently declined from 48.08 kobo to 25.27 kobo.
