 English Championship side West Bromwich Albion can hardly wait to unleash Super Eagles midfielder Semi Ajayi against opponents in the new season as they begin quest for return to the EPL. The club few days ago sealed a £1.3m ((about N585m) transfer deal that saw the 25 year old move from League One club Rotterdam to West Brom on an initial four year sojourn. West Brom apparently impressed by Ajayi’s exploits proudly announced his capture while reeling out his impressive runs in his former clubs, describing his performance at Rotterdam United where he made over 98 appearances scoring 12 goals as eye-catching. Ajayi who emerged sky Bet championship player of the year in 2018/19 appeared in all 46 league games played by the Millers. Ajayi who made Super Eagles provisional list for the just ended Nations cup but failed to make the final 23-man team, started his career at Charlton Athletic, earning his first professional contract in January 2012 after progressing through the ranks at The Valley. The former Nigeria under 20 ace who was born in London to Nigerian parents, was given his senior Super Eagles debut in September 2018, coming on in the second half of a 3-0 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying win against Seychelles, and has since made six appearances for the super Eagles. Semi Ajayi by joining West Brom, will be following the footsteps of former Nigeria international Peter Odemwingie who played for the Baggies from 2010 to 2013 making 87 appearances scoring 30 goals. Odemwingie had joined the side for an undisclosed fee on a two-year contract, with the option of a third year in the club’s favour. A day later, he scored an 81st minute goal on his premier league debut as Baggies beat Sunderland by a lone goal. West Brom begin the new season against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, August 3rd.
