The stage is set for another cultural fiesta courtesy of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC). It hosted no fewer than 36 ambassadors, high commissioners and representatives of countries to a pre-International Arts and Crafts Expo dinner in Abuja. The assemblage of countries like South Africa, Iran, Cameroun, Spain, China, Sudan, Venezuela, United States and others was a deliberate attempt by NCAC to rewrite the culture narratives of Nigeria as it prepares for a groundbreaking 2019 Expo holding in November in Abuja. The event, which held at the Sheraton Hotels, was a prelude to the expo, making it most memorable, especially for foreign nationals. NCAC Director-General Otunba Segun Runsewe thanked the various ambassadors and high commissioners for gracing the occasion, recalling that it was an improvement on the 22 countries that participated in last year’s event. Runsewe said the essence of the dinner was to provide a platform for diplomats to interact and unwind in an informal atmosphere  to further cement the cordial relationship already existing between them and the host country. Acccording to the culture chief, the third edition of INAC will dedicate the day to any country interested in entertaining the envoys, noting that last year’s witnessed phenomenal entertainment from countries, such as China, India and Bangladesh. After the dinner, Otunba Runsewe presented souvenirs to the envoys.  He said plans were  underway to ensure that this year’s Cultural Diplomacy Day for Peace slated for November 24 is marked. The dinner featured delectable Nigerian cuisine, sensational cultural presentation, group photo, exhibition of artistic masterpieces by contemporary Nigerian artists, a display of vintage bronze casts and other historic artefacts courtesy of NCAC.
