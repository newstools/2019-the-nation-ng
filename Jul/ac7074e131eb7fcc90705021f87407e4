WITH ‘911’ featuring Small Doctor and Qdot still rocking the airwaves, Dubai-based music maker, producer, actor and businessman Badmus Akeem O better known as Baddyoosha has released a new single, ‘Idan’ on Friday via music platforms like iTunes, Boomplay, Appstore and Google Play. Both singles are part of his soon-to-be released 7-track EP titled ‘STREET’ which will be released on August 2. Baddyoosha featured CDQ on ‘Idan’ which was mixed and mastered by Superbrainbeats. After his debut single ‘Esemi’ in 2014, the artiste who is also fondly called ‘Daddy Street’ has recorded 10 songs including ‘Timbalowo, ‘Angeli, ‘Oga’ and ‘Talon Shaye. Baddyoosha however, said that while he is very much engaged with the arts, business has also taken his time. “I don’t have enough time to do music,” he said in an interview. “Songs I’m meant to use for myself, I’ll give it out to close friends that are artists because that’s their own career but as for me I’m busy with other businesses. Okay let me give you this example. I acted in Alakada Reloaded. Also The Ghost And The Tout. These are cinema movies. So, if I say I’m a part time actor, am I lying? That’s why I tell you that I’m Jack of all trades.”
