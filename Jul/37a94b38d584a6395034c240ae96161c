Traditional ruler of Umueri, Anambra-East local government area of Anambra State, Igwe Sir Ben Izuchukwu Emeka has refuted alleged stockpiling of arms in preparation for war. The monarch also denied loss of lives of some youths in the area over alleged face-off between him and the President General of the community, Chief Pius Okonkwo. In a press statement issued on Saturday and made available to our correspondent, the traditional ruler described the allegation as malicious targeted at tarnishing his image and that of the community. The statement partly read, “The allegations of an armoury in my domain is false and to all intents and purposes intended to tarnish the reputation of my peace-loving community as well as drag my name to the mud. “There is no war in Umueri and the President-General and traditional ruler are working harmoniously well to ensure a tranquil atmosphere of love and unity for all and sundry to thrive. “We have reported to security agencies in the state, and they are on the trail of those who concocted these lies, and will soon be apprehended.” The monarch however admitted a minor internal town union leadership squabble leading to attempted impeachment on the PG,
but said the situation which government was aware of had been resolved.
