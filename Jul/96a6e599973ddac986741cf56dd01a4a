Former coach and skipper of Super Eagles Samson Siasia has spoken to his mother, Beauty Ogere, and two others abducted from his Odoni community in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State by gunmen. The gunmen, who reportedly called Siasia with a foreign number, were said to have demanded N70million ransom to release the 80-year-old woman. Siasia’s mother, for the second time in four years, was kidnapped on July 15 by gunmen, who fled the community to an unknown place through the River Nun. The gunmen also attacked another apartment in the Odoni community, kidnapping 66-year-old Florence Donana and her 17-year-old daughter. A family source, who spoke in confidence, confirmed that the hoodlums established contact for the first time with Siasia at about 11pm on Wednesday to begin negotiation for ransom. He said before they began negotiation, Siasia requested to speak with his mother, to ascertain proof of life. “He didn’t just speak to his mother. He also spoke to the other woman and her teenaged daughter. At least we are happy that mama is still alive. We are begging them to release their victims unconditionally”, the source said.
