American President Donald Trump on Saturday attacked another prominent African- American lawmaker, tweeting that his Baltimore district is a disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess.” The morning tirade was against Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee. President Trump had two weekends ago told four progressive Democratic congresswomen of color to go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Three of the four were born in the US and the fourth is a Somali born naturalised US citizen. Trump, in his Saturday tweet, suggested that the conditions in Cummings’ district, which is majority black and includes parts of Baltimore, are far more dangerous than those at the US-Mexico border. Trump said: “Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA. “As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place. “Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States? No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!”
