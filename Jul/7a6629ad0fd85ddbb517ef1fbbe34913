The Presidency yesterday cautioned Nigerians against politicising the death of Mrs. Funke Olakunri, the daughter of elderstatesman, Pa Reuben Fasoranti. It also urged leaders to consider their language over insecurity. The advice came on a day former President Olusegun Obasanjo came down hard on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration over insecurity. But a statement by the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, described insecurity as an issue that must be tackled frontally. Shehu said: “The Presidency had noted public concerns on the “unfortunate attack” that led to the death of Pa Fasoranti’s daughter. He said: “The President has already issued a statement expressing his heartfelt condolences to the family of Mrs. Funke Olakunri and followed up with a telephone call. “The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has in addition paid a visit to the grieving family in Akure, Ondo State. “Her death is a tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. It is incumbent on all leaders across the country to consider their language and its potential consequences. Insecurity is an issue that Nigeria must face together as one nation – united. “Times of tragedy like these are not the time for politics. politicising it reveals only disrespect for the departed and her family. “And we hope that those who stand in positions of influence recognise and understand this.”
