To promote its brands of wine across the globe, the Wines of South Africa (WOSA) held its seventh edition of its Wine Grand Tasting event. The event which was to celebrate Nelson Mandela Day, brought lovers of wines, entrepreneurs, distributors, and other tradesmen together as they network with the producers. They also had great tasting of the various brands  of South African wines. This year’s event commenced with South African Introductory Wine Course intended to upscale people in the hospitality and tourism industry to better understand wines. The  South Africa Consul-General, Nigeria, Darkey Africa, underscored the significance of Mandela, urging leaders to emulate the core values the late icon stood for. “Today marks the 10 years of the celebration of the International Nelson Madela Day. As we sip these wines, we reflect on the humanity, unity, love, compassion and care Mandela espoused.  We should also ask ourselves what you can do to advance these values.  We need to incorporate such values in our everyday lives.  This event is what we have been doing over the years in Nigeria.
