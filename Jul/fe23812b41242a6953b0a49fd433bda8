The West African Examinations Council (WAEC), on Friday, confirmed the release of this year’s May/June WASSCE results. However, If you didn’t get the result you were hoping for in the examinations, don’t be too hard on yourself. Here are six practical ways you can move forward. 1. Don’t Panic
Panicking isn’t going to take you anywhere. It won’t increase your score or make you pass. Accept that failing an exam is something perfectly normal to happen during your academic life. There are two things you need to know: you’re not alone and you can get a better grade. This is just one more obstacle to overcome, one more story to tell, and an experience that will help you do better on the next exam. 2. Take the time to grieve
Understand that it is normal to grieve.
When doing this, just have it at the back of your mind that life goes on and you have to get back on the bandwagon. 3. Get things in perspective
After the grief period is over, it’s a good time to get everything in perspective. Just stop for a moment and reflect on what went wrong. Think about what you did and didn’t so during your study period, and ask yourself “what could I have done differently?” Maybe you should try out different ways to approach your study sessions so that they become more enjoyable and less heavy and boring. 4. Think about the future
To clear up this issue in your mind, start thinking about the future, what next step to take. Be strategic and figure out when you’re going to retake the class and/or the exam again. Look at your study plan and course work and decide what’s best. 5. Draw out a plan
If you must retake the exam, you have to be mentally prepared. Draw out a plan, either retaking the exam now if you can (draw a plan of action now!) or only the following year. 6. Get help if you need it
Don’t feel embarrassed about asking for help. It’s a way of showing you want to understand something and don’t take pride in staying ignorant. Get a tutor. We all need help sometimes!
