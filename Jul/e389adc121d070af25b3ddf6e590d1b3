There was heavy protest in Bénin City, the Edo State capital over the resolution of the House of Representatives to take over functions of the Edo House of Assembly if Governor Godwin Obaseki fails to issue a fresh proclamation letter for proper inauguration of the Assembly The protest involved civil society groups, non-governmental organisations, market women, artisans, youths and students. They marched through various streets of Bénin City and carried placards displaying support for Governor Obaseki. At the premises of the Edo State House of Assembly, the protesters warned they would resist shutting down of the Assembly by security agencies. Spokesman for the protesters, Mr. Olu Martins, said the issues on the Edo Assembly are in court. “Everybody should stay and play to the rule of the game because we believe in rule of law. “We have banished godfather from Edo State more than eight years ago, we cannot allow it come back now.  “Comrade Oshiomhole (Adams) spent eight years. Obaseki must spend his eight years. We will not allow anybody to stop him.” Edo State APC Youth Leader, Mr. Valentine Asuen, said “APC youths in Edo State are with you (Obaseki) because you have a sincere and legitimate mission. “So remain focused and don’t be distracted knowing that the sky is not your limit but your starting point.” He added: “It is four over four. No way for godfather because just the same way donkey meat have become a thing of the past in Edo State, so will they also become a thing of the past “.
