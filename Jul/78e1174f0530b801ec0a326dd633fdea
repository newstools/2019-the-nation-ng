The Indomitable Lions of Cameroon will lock horns with the Super Eagles of Nigeria in Alexandria on Saturday evening in the Round of Sixteen of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, following the goalless draw the Lions recorded against Benin Republic today. The Black Stars of Ghana, on their part avoided Nigeria, when they beat Guinea-Bissau 2-0 in Suez. Jordan Ayew and Thomas Partey got their names on the score sheet in the 46th and 72nd minute respectively. This will be the fifth time the Super Eagles will face Cameroon in the Africa up of Nations. They lost three times in 1984, 1988 and 2000, and beat the Lions once in 2004. Benin Republic went through as one of the four best third-placed teams and will come up against Morocco on Friday evening Cameroon came closest to scoring against Benin but both Ambroise Oyongo and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting saw their efforts saved by goalkeeper Saturnin AllagbeÂ  as he dived full length to his right to make two stunning fingertip saves in the opening period. The squirrels had their best chance fall to Stephane Sessegnon, but the former Sunderland and West Brom midfielder struck a free-kick narrowly wide.
