A boat accident in Borgu local government area of Niger State has claimed 15 lives. The bodies of other passengers on the boat have not been recovered. The boat was said to have been returning from Warrah market, a border community in Ngaski local government area of Kebbi state to Sabo Yumu in Borgu. The accident, which occurred at River Malale on Sunday night, was as a result of the bad weather which caused low visibility. The boat was said to have run into a tree stump on river Malale midway into the journey. According to a source, only two people were rescued from the mishap while 15 corpses were recovered. The source said that no-one has been able to ascertain the number of people in the boat. According to the source: “The boat was big and have capacity for over 50. Also because it is market day, there is the tendency that it might be overloaded.” The Director General of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ibrahim Ahmed Inga confirmed the accident saying 15 corpses have been recovered. He added that divers are still searching for the remaining of the occupants adding that the high rate of death is caused by unavailability of life jackets. Inga however said the state government is working towards putting in place regulatory framework to check the activities of boat operators and providing life jackets in order to reduce high casualties experienced in boat accidents.
