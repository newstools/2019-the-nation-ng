Three policemen have been detained at the Edo State Police headquarters for two missing   AK 7 rifles. Also, a salesgirl, security personnel and manager of a guest house where the guns were stolen, have been quizzed and granted bail. Sergeant Uzor Emmanuel, Corporal Michael Akharamen and Constable Jimoh Aliu, were assigned for duty patrol, but could not return the guns to the armoury. It was gathered that the two junior officers gave their guns to Sergeant Emmanuel, who checked into a guest house at Uwasota area, Egor Local Government Area. Sources said Sergeant Emmanuel was with a female friend in the hotel when at about 2am, he raised the alarm that two of the three rifles he took into his room had been stolen while he was in the toilet. Owner of the guest house, Mr. Obodo Otuya, who called for probe of the incident, told reporters that the claim by SGT Emmanuel was questionable. He stated that reports from his staff showed that Sergeant Emmanuel checked in with one AK-47 rifle and a lady. Edo Police spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP) said an investigation is still ongoing.
