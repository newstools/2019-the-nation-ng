A high end property developer, LandWey Group, has indicated plans to begin the construction of a 28-floor, coastal shoreline, mixed-use high rise property at the Eko Atlantic City. A groundbreaking ceremony will hold at the emerging new city on October 1. Speaking about this monumental project yesterday, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder of the LandWey Group, Olawale Ayilara, said the project, which would be known as “The Audacity Skyline,” would sit on 3,500 square metres inside the Eko Atlantic City. He said: “The Audacity Skyline is an architectural masterpiece that will feature tastefully finished beachfront residences and penthouses, commercial spaces, multi-level parking, designated elevators, personalised concierge services, all executed with best-in-class construction procedures and standards. “As a brand, we are ready and equipped to take on the project, armed with our robust experience in construction, as well as our strong partnerships with world- class architects, engineers and designers.” Ayilara said LandWey has broken barriers and set the pace and tone in the real estate sector within the past half a decade. “We’re excited about this massive project. The groundbreaking ceremony of The Audacity Skyline is scheduled to hold on October 1,” he added. Ayilara said the company was poised to venture into high-end real estate investment products in the most befitting location – the prestigious Eko Atlantic City. The real estate sector in Lagos has witnessed a lot of growth and innovation within the past five years with an abundance of investment options, as well as creative marketing ideas and one brand that actively contributes immensely to that growth is the LandWey Group. LandWey boasts a growing asset base of real estate products that are tailored to the middle market; a niche that they have performed comfortably well in.
