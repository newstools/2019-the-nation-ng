Hundreds of protesters have called for the prosecution of Senator Elisha Abbo and his police orderlies. The call came following a video that went viral where the newly elected senator under the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was seen assaulting a female at a sex toy shop in Abuja. The protesters who marched on the Force headquarters in Abuja said the senator must be investigated and recalled by his constituency. Some of the notable faces amongst the protesters are the convener of Concerned Nigerian group, Deji Adeyanju,Â  Aisha Yesufu of #BringBackOurGirls, Yemi Adamolekun of Enough is Enough, Bukky Shonibare, and so many others. The protesters read and submitted a copy of their petition to the Force Spokesman, DCP Frank Mba who was there to address them. The Petition was addressed to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammad Adamu. According to Mba, the IGP has directed the FCT Commissioner of Police, CP Bala Ciroma to carry out thorough investigation into the matter.
