It was a thrilling time for fans of highlife singer Flavour N’Nbania in Port Harcourt, Rivers State as the ‘Ada Ada’ crooner graced the stage at the launch of Life Lager 33cl can. The event was the quarter-finals of the ongoing Hi-life fest. Adding fervor to launch were the Hi-life fest quarter-finalists who also competed for a place in the semi-final slated for August 4, 2019. At the event, the Portfolio Manager, mainstream lager, Omotunde Adenusi, thanked Life lager’s loyal consumers and vowed that the brand will continue to celebrate progress and culture. “As they say, variety is the spice of Life,” said Adenusi. “This new handy can, adds to our 50cl cans as well as our 60cl bottles as part of our product offerings, hence giving consumers more options to enjoy Life Lager.” The night ended with a performance by winner of the 2017 Hi-life fest, Chibest David.
