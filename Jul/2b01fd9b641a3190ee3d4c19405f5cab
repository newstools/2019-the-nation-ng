The National Automotive Design & Development Council (NADDC) Director-General and the Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) Corp Marshal Boboye Oyeyemi will lead other experts to the Nigerian Auto Journalists Association (NAJA) training workshop. The workshop, designed to aid human capacity for journalists reporting the automotive sector, will hold July 26 at the Golden Tulip Hotel, along the Murtala Muhammed International Airport road, Lagos. The reporters would be trained on basic principles of mechatronics, automotive maintenance, electrical/electronic systems and air-conditioning systems. The event will also provide avenue for critical stakeholders to ventilate their perspectives on some of the burning issues that relate with the auto industry and the way forward. Chairperson Organising Committee Julie Chi-Nwaoha said there is need for consistent training and retraining of journalists to be up-to-date on their beat. The workshop, she said, will impact positively on members as knowledgeable and competent instructors will be on hand to give their best to members. “Journalism is wide and we must open ourselves to consistent training and retraining. It is important that journalists writing about the automotive sector are well informed; they must be well educated and empowered to write effectively without error of facts,” she said.
