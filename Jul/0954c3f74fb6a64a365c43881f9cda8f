 Call it dollar rain and you will be perfectly correct as Super Eagles look set to be rewarded with $175,000 (About N63million). The largesse is courtesy of Alteo boss Benedict Peters who had just before the match promised to give the team $100,000 if they beat Cameroon and addition promise of $25,000 per goal. Eagles did not only make defeat of Cameroon a reality but scored three goals thanks Ighalo and Iwobi. Although there were glaring shortfalls in the match Nigerians believe it is was a major improvement compared to what the team played leading to a 2-0 loss to Madagascar in the last group match. Cameroon are thus became the second  high profile team to exit Egypt just a day after Morocco were sent packing by Benin Republic contrary to permutations in some quarters. Saturday’s match saw two African legends Samuel Eto and Nwankwo Kanu watching from a vintage position, jubilating intermittently depending on which way the pendulum was swinging.  It was however Kanu who smile last at the end of regulation time.
