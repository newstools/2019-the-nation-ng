THE governor’s wife described it as a battle between darkness and light and she declared that light would win. So, yesterday when Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole met at the Presidential Villa in Abuja for the presidential policy retreat, not a few remembered Obaseki’s wife’s statements. Light and darkness met and shook hands. That is a first! As Obaseki and Oshiomhole held hands and smiled, they were joined by Africa’s richest man Aliko Dangote, Chief of Staff Abba Kyari and Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) Chairman Dr. Kayode Fayemi. They spoke animatedly and made light of the situation in Edo State, which has seen lawmakers loyal to Oshiomhole unable to access the House of Assembly, where they were shut out on the proclamation day. The way they plumped hands and laughed heartily it was difficult to believe that only days ago their supporters were spitting fire. But the pictures have raised a major poser: Is this the end of the roforofo fight in Edo? Time will certainly tell if the smiles and exchange of pleasantries are just for the cameras.
