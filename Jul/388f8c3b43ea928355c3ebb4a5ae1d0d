A MIDDLE-AGED expectant mother was on Tuesday burnt to death in a motor accident which occurred on Omi Adio, Ibadan  axis of the Ibadan- Abeokuta expressway. The accident also left several others with varying degree of injuries. About eight people were said to have sustained severe injuries when they were trapped in the Lite Ace commercial bus coming from Apata to Omi Adio, along the one lane expressway. The ill- fated commercial bus, according to eyewitness account, developed mechanical problem when its shaft pulled off, causing the driver to lose control  and ran into a ditch after somersaulting several times. However, the confused passengers,  numbering about 10, were in the process of finding their way out of the wrecked bus when it went up in flames, trapping  the occupants. As dozens of sympathisers struggled to rescue the victims, the pregnant woman, who seated in front became unconscious and was unable to escape from the inferno. A team of officers from the Apata, Ibadan Unit of the Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) and police officers from the traffic section of the Omi Adio, Ibadan Divisional Police Station were seen assisting sympathisers to evacuate the victims of the accident from the deep valley where the bus plunged. As at the time of filing this report, the wreckage of the burning commercial bus was yet to be retrieved from the deep valley. The injured were rushed to a nearby medical facility, Alaafia hospital, Apata, where they were receiving medical attention. The body of pregnant woman was said to have deposited at the Adeoyo State Hospital Morgue, Ring road, Ibadan. A police source from Omi Adio Police Station attributed the accident to over speeding and lack of maintenance culture among commercial vehicles’ operators .
