OAK Pensions Limited is working to make pension more accessible to the grassroots through the micro pension plan, the Chairman of the company, Dr. Awa Ibraheem, has said. He spoke while presenting the 2018 financial result of the company during its 13th annual general meeting in Lagos. Ibraheem said the micro pension plan has been designed by the regulatory authority, the National Pension Commission (PenCom), to ensure pension is less elitist. He assured that the company would continue to ensure excellent service delivery and prompt payment of retirement benefits while it leverages on technology. According to him, it is proper for people to start preparing for pensions early in life, so as to have a comfortable future. Ibraheem said the company had continued to organise forums for its contributors in the country to enlighten them on the benefits of the scheme, as well as the retirement options. He said that since inception, the Contributory Pensions Scheme had increased, and as people saw more benefits in it, they would embrace the scheme. The Managing Director, Mr Samuel Inyang, disclosed that the company’s assets under management rose by 19 per cent in 2018. He said the company was uniquely positioned to offer pension with complimentary integrated solutions that promote financial security for the future, build loyalty and locked-in long-term relationship. He said: “We would be defending our market share with superior fund performance, exceptional service delivery across all customer touch point, and remain proactive in engaging and ensuring that RSA members and institutional clients expectations are not only met but exceeded. “We will optimise our social media handles and other communication channels to enhance information dissemination to both our internal and external customers; and enhancement of our e-channels for improved service delivery to our customers”, he added.
