THE Super Eagles team which placed third at the AFCON in Egypt, have checked out of the Hilton Hotel in Abuja as they will not be hosted by the government. Nigeria placed third for the eighth time in their history. They were received by the Secretary to the Federal Government Boss Mustapha on arrival from Cairo. “Do you expect a country like Nigeria, who only six years ago won the AFCON in South Africa, to now start celebrating a third-place finish? That will be going back many years after,” a top official asked. Expectations were high that the Eagles will go all the way to win a fourth AFCON crown in Egypt. However, they crashed out of the tournament in the semi-finals after they lost 1-2 to eventual champions Algeria. The Eagles are drawn against the Benin Republic, Lesotho and Sierra-Leone in the qualifying tournament for the 2021 AFCON to be hosted by Cameroun.
