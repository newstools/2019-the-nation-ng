Residents of Enugwu-Agidi community in Njikoka local government area of Anambra state have been thrown into mourning following the sudden death of a 23-year old man identified as Nduka. The deceased was reportedly electrocuted when he climbed a breadfruit tree to cut its branches directly under electric high tension wire in the area. The Nation learnt the deceased, who hailed from Iruobieri village of the community, was reportedly hired to carry out the act. A resident of the area, who craved anonymity, said officials of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), Enugwu-Agidi unit had warned the tree be cut down to ensure free flow of current. “The man was hired to cut down branches of the tree because of the repeated warning from officers of the EEDC who claimed the tree was obstructing free flow of electric current,” he said. He described the deceased as a quiet young man who cared for his mother more than his siblings, adding that his body has been deposited in the mortuary. President General, Enugwu-Agidi Brotherly Union (EBU), Chidi Okoye described the incident as regrettable, blaming it on carelessness of the deceased. He said: “The leadership of the union has been warning the villagers not to engage in any responsibility meant for EEDC because of the inherent dangers. “The man failed to consult the electricity committee chairman who could have informed the EEDC of his intention. “He just lost his life out of sheer carelessness. The sad incident is a lesson to everybody in the community. “I believe that nobody will be foolish enough to attempt such act without involving the EEDC.” Okoye, however, cautioned the youths in the area not to take laws into their hands, insisting, “there is no need for civil unrest in the community as a result of the death.”
