Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has congratulated Prince Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye on his emergence as the Olowo-elect of Owo Kingdom. The governor’s message came after reports he received from one of the Senior Omolowos (Kingmakers), Chief Jamiu Ekungba on the outcome of the selection process which, according to him, was peaceful, democratic and procedural in line with the customs and tradition guiding the selection of an Olowo. The Governor said, even as the State Government awaits a formal written communication from the Kingmakers as required by law, he was enamoured by the peaceful conduct that heralded the emergence of the Olowo-elect. Specifically, Governor Akeredolu in a statement by the State Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo  commended the peaceful manner in which the selection processes went since they began. This, according to him, posited an enviable narrative that has dwarfed the needless tension which enveloped the ancient City of OWO since the commencement of the selection processes. He said  “it is therefore, apposite to submit that the ingenious democratic template enunciated by the Kingmakers has produced the choice of Owo indigenes as demonstrated by the outcome of the selection. Mr Governor considers this highly commendable and an enduring legacy for Owo Kingdom. While wishing Prince Ogunoye God’s wisdom and Grace as he prepares to ascend the throne of his forebearers, Governor Akeredolu appealed to the Olowo-elect to unite all sons and daughters of Owo Kingdom. He particularly enjoins Prince Ogunoye to extend hands of fellowship to other contenders to the ancient throne before his emergence. As Owo Kingdom awaits the traditional rites that will culminate in the final coronation of the Olowo-elect, Governor Akeredolu expressed optimism that Owo indigenes would take maximum advantage of this moment of fresh breath and savour the peaceful ambience that has berthed in the Kingdom.
