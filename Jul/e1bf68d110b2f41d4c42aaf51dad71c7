The Hope Democratic Party (HDP) and its presidential candidate in the last election, Ambrose Owuru have closed their case in the prosecution of their petition. HDP and Owuru are challenging the outcome of the last election and sought to be declared winners, claiming to have won a referendum purportedly conducted after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) postponed the presidential election. On Monday, lawyers to the petitioners, Eze Nnalugo called Yusuf Ibrahim as the first witness, who testified before the Presidential Election Petition Court(PEPC) in support of the petitioners’ claim. The court however rejected two other witnesses called by the petitioners, including a supeonaed witness,on the grounds that they had no written depositions, as required by law. Nnalugo later announced the closure of the petitioners’ case.
