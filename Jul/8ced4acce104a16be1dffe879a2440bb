A 21-year-old man, Qudus Ololade, who pleaded guilty to dispossessing a man of an iPhone and N30,000 cash, on Monday changed his plea before his sentence. Ololade was arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on June 7. He was remanded at the Kirikiri Prisons, Apapa, Lagos, following his guilty plea. But, when Magistrate O.A. Aderibigbe, was about to sentence him yesterday, he changed his plea, claming that he pleaded guilty under duress. Aderibigbe granted him N100,000 bail with two sureties who should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Inspector Mojirade Edeme said the defendant committed the offence on May 7 at Iyana-Iba, Lagos. Edeme said the defendant stole the iPhone 6 Plus worth N195, 000 and N30, 000 cash from Chima Ugo. “The defendant removed the items from the complainant’s bag while both were rushing to enter a bus. He jumped down from the bus before the complainant could discover the theft. Unfortunately for him, he was arrested by the police, when asked about his mission at that time of the night. He could not give a satisfactory answer, and when he was searched, the items were found on him. “During interrogation, it was discovered that he stole the items. The defendant was taken to a police station,” the prosecutor said. According to the prosecutor, Ugo was reached through a contact on his phone. The case continues on July 24.
