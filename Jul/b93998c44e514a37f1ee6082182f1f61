Ohanaeze Ndigbo has rejected the proposed Federal government Ruga settlement and warned it to steer clear of Igboland in that regard. The apex Igbo organisation also urged South East governors to stick to their earlier rejection of the scheme. It further warned traditional rulers, town union presidents, communities and individuals in the South East to be wary of lures, overtures and mouthwatering offers intended to induce them part with their land in the guise of industrial ventures. In a strongly worded statement on Wednesday by President General of the organisation, Chief John Nnia Nwodo, the organisation declared: “The attempt by the Federal Government to foist RUGA settlements on the country has met stiff resistance from some states. “Consequently, the protagonists of the scheme are now said to be trying to use clandestine moves to surreptitiously bring it into dissenting states through the back door.” The body added: “The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, was quoted to have said because of misconceptions and opposition to the scheme, the Federal Government would no longer announce the states that enter into agreement for its establishment in their states, thereby suggesting that some states are secretly entering into an understanding with the Federal Government to establish the RUGA scheme in them. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide once more restates its objection to the RUGA scheme in Igboland and urges the South East State Governments to stick to their earlier decision to reject the scheme. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo also warns traditional rulers, town union presidents, communities and individuals in the South East to be wary of lures, overtures and mouthwatering offers intended to induce them to part with their land ostensibly for industrial ventures but disguised approaches to obtain land for RUGA settlements. “Ohanaeze further warns that Ndigbo will not forgive any government, community or individual that falls into this trap and will collectively resist any such move.”
