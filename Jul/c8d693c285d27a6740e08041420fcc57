The lawmaker-elect for Oredo West Constituency in the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon Chris Okaeben, has been suspended by the All Progressives Congress in Oredo Local Government Area. Hon Okaeben was last week issued a 48-hour ultimatum to apologize to Governor Godwin Obaseki for misconduct but he replied that he did nothing wrong. Okaeben is one of the 12 members-elect that are insisting that the inauguration of the 7th Edo Assembly was illegal. He was suspended for  allegedly violating provisions of Article 21 of the APC constitution which stipulates disciplinary actions for erring members. The suspension of Okaeben was announced on Friday at an enlarged meeting of Oredo APC members in Oredo Local Government Area of the state after adopting recommendation of  a 5-man panel set up in July 1, to investigate Okaeben’s alleged misconduct. Chairman of APC in Oredo LGA, Mr. Godwin Alabi, who read the report of the panel to members of the party, said Okaeben failed to honour several invitations extended to him to ascertain his grievances against the party. Alabi thanked the committee members for their objectivity saying the party has complied with the recommendation of the panel which includes the suspension of Chris Okaeben, who was elected to represent Oredo West Constituency in the state assembly. “Following his utterances, the APC in the council area asked him to apologise but he refused to comply with the party’s directive, rather he threatened the life of the chairman of the party in the council area, Godwin Alabi.” Chairman of Oredo Local Government Area, Hon. Jenkins Osunde, said the party’s attention should now be focused on supporting Governor Godwin Obaseki to deliver the dividends of democracy to Edo people.
