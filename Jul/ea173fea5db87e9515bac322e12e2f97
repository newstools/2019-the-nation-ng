Unity Bank Plc has thrown its weight behind the 2019 Young Professionals Lagos capacity building workshop, which featured mentorship of 600 young, courageous and ambitious professionals by 60 Captains of industry in Lagos. The programme is an avenue for the participants to build potential career defining relationships with mentors found among industry chieftains facilitating different roundtables. According to the organizers, the YP capacity building workshop is exclusively targeted at young professionals of 35 years old and below, who in their professional or career pursuits are already budding entrepreneurship initiatives. “We therefore convocated 60 breakfast roundtables to create interaction, experience and knowledge sharing in addition to giving opportunity for participants to benefit from consulting with captains of industry after the workshop”, Wale Adenuga, promoter of Unboxed Conferences and YP, Lagos has stated.
