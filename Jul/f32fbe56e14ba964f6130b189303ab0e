 A kiss that will last the distance awaits any member of the Peruvian squad who seals victory for Peru against Chile in the semifinal of the Copa America . The unusual but special incentive is coming from a popular Peruvian soap actress Stephanie Cayo. Peru are considered underdogs in the fixture in some quarters but Cayo believes her country men can go the extra mile to carry the day in Porto Alegre. “We want to give a kiss to the Peru national team. I’m seriously thinking about offering a kiss (obviously with permission) to whoever is responsible for beating Chile “the 31-year-old actress wrote on Twitter to her almost 800,000 followers which generated 8,000 likes and more than 7,000 comments. Caro who is well known in Peru and Columbia added on Instagram that she was “offering my grain of sand” towards Peru victory. Peru who are two time winners of the Copa America last won the title in 44 years ago and Cayo who was born way after the last victory in 1975 is eager to see her countrymen lift the trophy in her presence. The country first won the title in 1939. This is the third time in the last four editions that they have reached the semifinals. Chile on their part have won the last two Copa editions, on home soil in 2015 and then the Centenario tournament in the United States a year later. The winner of Thursday’s semifinal tie will face Brazil in Sunday’s final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil defeated Argentina 2-0 to book a place in the final. Uruguay are the highest winners of the Copa America with 15 titles in the kitty. Brazil who are already waiting for their Sunday opponents are searching for their 9th title haven won 8 editions previously.
