Samsung Electronics yesterday said it will leverage exciting content and service partnerships to deliver a truly ground-breaking viewing experience and unprecedented value to its customers in the country. Chief Marketing Officer at Samsung Central Africa, Dudu Mokholo, who spoke in Lagos during the unveiling of 2019 TV line, said the South Korean Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) will continue to delight its customers with quality products. He said: “Our 2019 QLED line is designed for users who want the best combination of picture quality, smart TV capabilities and design. This year’s line-up represents our largest screen size offering ever. It brings together innovative feature enhancements and exciting content and service partnerships to deliver a truly ground-breaking viewing experience and unprecedented value.” He said the products are powered by Samsung’s proprietary Quantum Processor and features more screen size options, stunning picture quality enhancements, dazzling colours from every angle, exciting new design elements and intuitive smart TV upgrades. “As part of this special launch, those who purchase a 2019 QLED TV between July and August 2019 will receive a Samsung UHD or FHD TV for free,” he assured. According to him, the 2019 Q80 feature Ultra Viewing Angle (UVA)  technology, which restructures the TV’s panels so the backlight passes through the panel with lights evenly onto the screen.
