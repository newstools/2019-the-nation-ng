THE Irede Foundation (TIF), a non-governmental organisation, and the world’s number one personal-care company, Nivea, have called on Nigerians to support children with disabilities by creating an enabling environment for them to access quality education. The two organisations made the plea after the commemoration of the 2019 global limb awareness month and the ‘Out on a Limb’ annual awareness walk organised by TIF. The annual walk, which was graced by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, also had in attendance over 100 Lagosians. In his remarks, Sanwo-Olu urged affluent Nigerians and companies to provide support for limbless children. “To build a better world, we all need to support one another. The Irede Foundation and Nivea Nigeria have demonstrated that together, we can all do more. I hope more companies and individuals can also join this social cause,” he said.
