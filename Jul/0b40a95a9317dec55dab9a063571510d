The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force) has served a seven-day removal notice on owners illegal structures on Badagry Expressway. Operators of commercial activities were not spared. Addressing the affected people on Tuesday during a visit, the Chairman, Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, ordered them to vacate road setbacks and walkways within the stipulated period. He said illegal structures on road setbacks and walkways from Eric Moore to Trade Fair should be removed, adding that traders and others should remove kiosks, containarised shops, etc on road setbacks and walkways on or before July 23. Egbeyemi said the removal notice became imperative to prepare for the beginning of work on the road along that corridor and dislodge criminals robbing motorists and others of their belongings. He said: “It is an eyesore seeing owners of these illegal structures occupy road setbacks and walkways, causing flood whenever it rains. “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s newly-signed ‘Executive Order’ on traffic and sanitation has declared zero tolerance for environmental abuse, illegal and indiscriminate dumping of refuse and defacement of the environment.” The task force chairman urged miscreants who have turned under pedestrian bridges, shanties and abandoned vehicles, including containerized shops, to their abode to vacate them, “as anyone caught will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the law.”
