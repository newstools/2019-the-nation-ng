The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria Council has said big data remains a key enabler of exploring business insights and economics of services in the petroleum sector. The Chairman, SPE Nigeria Council, Mr Debo Fagbami, stated this while addressing reporters in Lagos preparatory to the Society’s 2019 edition of the Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition (NAICE). According to Wikipaedia, Big data is a field that treats ways to analyse, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Fagbami said the oncoming conference seeks to explore available data to proactively address technical issues affecting the oil and gas sector. The theme of this year’s NAICE is “Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Mobile Technology: Changing the Future of Energy Industry.” The conference is scheduled to hold in Lagos from August 5 to 7. Fagbami explained that stakeholders would address issues bordering on digital transformation and emerging trends in artificial intelligence; intersection of information and energy technologies, with focus on empowering women for digital age. He said the conference will unveil solutions to recurring issues of oil pipeline vandalism and technical challenges in the oil exploration and production sector. According to him, leveraging insights from artificial intelligence, big data and mobile technology remains a key enabler of exploring business insights in oil and gas industry, noting that the forum would also focus on collecting and encouraging the dissemination of technical knowledge and technologies related to the oil and gas industry.
