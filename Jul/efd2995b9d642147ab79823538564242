Two children – Shater Abomnger (10) and Terhide Abomnger (eight) – have drowned in a stream in Gboko South, Gboko Local Government Area in Benue State. The tragedy ocurred at noon on Saturday. The deceased were siblings. Their father, Mr. Teryima Abomnger, is a yam dealer of No. 5 Ahule Iusu Street, Gboko South. The incident took place near Nguembi stream around St. Thomas Catholic Church, Gboko South. A witness, Mr. Joseph Orban, a resident of No. 30B Shaahu Road, Gboko South, who spoke with The Nation at the scene of the unfortunate incident,  said the two siblings were drowned at about 12:45 noon while in search of used water plastic containers. The deceased were primary five  and three pupils at Aunty Ayam’s Nursery and Primary School, Gboko. According Orban, Shater slipped and was drowning in the lake and his younger brother, Terhide, dived into the stream to save him. They both got drowned. He explained that efforts by him and others to save the two kids proved abortive. But with the help of some young men, their bodies were recovered and taken to the General Hospital, Gboko, where they were certified death. Orban called on both Gboko Local Government and Benue State Government to come to the support of the community by filling up the lake. He added that erosion that ravaged the lake has now turned it into a death trap. He regretted that within his 15 years in the area, he had witnessed over 30 drowned cases. The bereaved father, who is an indigent of Kunav Mbayongu, Vandekya Local Government Area, told reporters that he and his wife left their children at home for Gboko market. He said a friend called him on the phone that two of his children have been drowned in a stream. He said: “I was shocked when I rushed home and found their bodies on the floor of my house with sympathisers standing by and wailing.” Chairman of Gboko Local Government Jacon Iorver said drastic measures would be taken to sand fill the stream to avoid future occurrence.
