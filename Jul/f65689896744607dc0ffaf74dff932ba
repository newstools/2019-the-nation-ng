TWO persons died on Wednesday in a clash between the Toru-Orua and Ofoni communities in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the killings unsettled both communities as youths, armed with dangerous weapons, engaged one another in a free-for-all. Sources said trouble started following issues bordering on motorcycle theft. The victims were said to have died in the process of stealing the motorcycle. One of the victims allegedly killed the owner of the motorcycle while trying to steal the motorcycle. Angry kinsmen of the slain motorcyclists mobilised and traced the alleged killer in the neighbouring community and mobbed him to death. The action, it was gathered, led to a bloody conflict between youths of the two communities. Police spokesman Asinim Butswat said the police deployed operatives immediately and restored order in the area.
