ELECTRICITY Distribution Companies (DisCos) on Monday denied the allegation of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) that the system collapse that was experienced on Sunday was “due to high voltage following massive drop of load by DisCos.” Speaking with The Nation on phone, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company ( AEDC), Mr. Oyebode Fadipe, said: “We didn’t drop any load.” Asked whether it was true that the DisCos dropped load allocation on Sunday, the Director, Research and Advocacy, Association of Nigeria Electricity Distributors (ANED), Mr. Sunday Odutan, said it is “not true.” He said power allocation to the AEDC as at yesterday had increased to nearly 500mega watts (Mw). The company gets 13 percent of the total power generation from the national grid on daily basis. This shows that yesterday power generation was about 3,692Mw after the Benin inferno led to the system collapse. According to a statement by the General Manager Public Affairs, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, on Sunday, the high voltage also caused a fire incident in the 75MXreactor in the Benin Substation, Sapele Road in Benin City, Edo State.
