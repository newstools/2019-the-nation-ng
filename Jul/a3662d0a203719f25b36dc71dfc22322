A CAMPUSLIFE correspondent and final year student of Medicine and Surgery, at the Benue State University, Msonter Anzaa, has won the 2018 National Undergraduate Essay competition organised by the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (CIPM). At the event in Lagos, CIPM Registrar and Chief Executive Officer, Mrs Ajibola Ponnle said the yearly contest was one of the institute’s way of reaching out to the nation, particularly the youth. Mrs Ponnle expressed satisfaction with the contest, which she said has grown from only attracting entries from few universities to becoming a national affair. She, therefore, urged the winners to remain ambassadors of the institute. Msonter recounted how he repeatedly participated in the competition for six years. He said he learnt the virtues of hard work and perseverance from his father, who rose through the ranks as a village headmaster to become a university lecturer and a doctorate degree holder. He praised the CIPM for being consistent in organising the competition. He thanked The Nation for providing him a platform to hone his writing skills as a campus correspondent and opinion writer. He also thanked the management of the Benue State University for providing a conducive environment  for  him to pursue his dreams. His essay was entitled: ‘’Employment opportunities – Building from nothing through creative solutions’.’ Other awardees were Ndubuisi Chibuzor of Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Olawoyin Mustapha of the Faculty of Law Department, University of Ilorin. The competition is open to undergraduates in tertiary institutions. The top seven essayists attended an oral defence of their essays at CIPM House in Lagos after which the best three were announced. The 2018 edition attracted 120 entries across 34 universities.
