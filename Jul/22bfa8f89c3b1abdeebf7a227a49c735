The Lagos State police Command will, henceforth, take advantage of the state-of-the-art government owned  DNA and Forensic Centre (LSD&FC) in its investigation and resolution of crime cases. Commissioner Zubairu Muazu said on Thursday. Speaking during his visit to the LSD&FC at Odunlami Street, Lagos Island, he said it was ideal to have such a facility, which was used in advanced countries in crime investigation. He said the command would work with the centre to scientifically combat crime. LSD&FC Managing Consultant Dr. Richard Somiari, who took the police chief round the facility, said it had the technology and expertise to support the DNA testing needs of the state. He listed some of the services of the centre to include consultation on cold cases, crime scene processing, evidence collection, serological screening for blood, semen and saliva, DNA analysis, mass disaster victim identification and old case files review. Somiari said an important task before the centre was the development and management of a central DNA database to be called Lagos State DNA Database (LSDD). “The DNA crime laboratory will be helpful when dealing with organised crime, including automobile theft, home burglaries and extortion.” “Many of these crimes are organised, gang related and committed by the same people and with DNA forensics, the DNA from the crime scenes and from suspects will be put in a DNA database,” Somiari said. He said the project would allow the testing of human specimens such as blood, urine, saliva and tissue to check for chemicals, poisons and toxins that might be harmful or responsible for death. Somiari added that the Chemistry section would allow the testing of suspicious and controlled substances recovered from individuals or from crime scenes.
