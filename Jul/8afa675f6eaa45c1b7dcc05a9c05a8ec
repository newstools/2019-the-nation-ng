The Nigerian team will take on Japan in one of the placement games to decide teams that that will finish between the 17th and 20th position at IHF Men’s Junior (U21) World Championship in Spain. The other game in this category will see Bahrain take on Chile with the winner of both games battling for the 17th and 18th position, while the losers fight for the 19th and 20th position. Nigeria failed to qualify for the last 16 after losing to Sweden 41-25 in the last Group B game on Monday. The Nigerian team won only one of its five group games against Australia to place fifth and confined to play in the placement round. Coach Shittu Adewunmi, however, said the focus would be to improve the team’s position as it battles other first round losers in the placement games. “Our focus I to ensure we are able to improve on our present placement. “The teams that we are playing against are equally good but hopefully we can do well against them. My players are ready as usual but like I said on Monday not having a complete team is a problem. “Some of the players were injured in the last game, while we could not bring in players who had their jersies torn to replace those that were tired and needed rest. “The technical crew will continue to fashion out winning formulas that will give us victory,” Adewunmi added.
