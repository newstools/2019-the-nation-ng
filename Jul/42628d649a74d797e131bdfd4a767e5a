Oba Rilwan Akiolu of Lagos yesterday said he has no apologies for being frank. He said he would always speak truth to power because he fears nobody. The monarch spoke when Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu met with traditional rulers at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja. He said he was not anybody’s rubber stamp adding that former governor Bola Tinubu, did not reject his advice and requests. He, however, told Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, not to accede to his request if they were unworthy. The Oba advised Sanwo-Olu and his deputy to listen to advice and digest such information before responding. This, he said, was important because many who will come to advise them were hypocrites, who will go and tell everybody the discussions. Akiolu said the visit became necessary because leaders must be respected. The visit, he said, was an opportunity to discuss germane security and socio-economic development issues. The monarch said the visit was to congratulate the governor on his victory at the polls. He promised that the kings and their chiefs would work with the governor to ensure that his administration is a success. The governor thanked the traditional rulers for the visit, promised to foster a good working relationship with the traditional institutions for Lagos to be safe and be a destination of choice for investment. On Akiolu’s entourage were Kings from the five divisions of Lagos. Present were Secretary to the State Government, Folashade Jaji and the Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde.
