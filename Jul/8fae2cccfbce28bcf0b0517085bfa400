BAYELSA State governor, Hon. Seriake Dickson, is in a dilemma as no fewer than four people in his government are jostling for the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the governorship election in the state gathers momentum. The primary election of PDP, the ruling party in the state, scheduled for September 3, 2019. Already, the PDP is divided into two major camps – a caucus controlled by the Restoration Family of the governor and a group loyal to former President Goodluck Jonathan. Dickson’s restoration caucus is believed to control more than 80 per cent of PDP members in the state, which explains why the governorship aspirants are desperate to have his backing. Although the governor has continually said he would not impose a candidate on the party, he has insisted on not being succeeded by anyone outside his Restoration Family. The problem, however, is that he wants to choose his successor but does not want to offend any of the members of the Restoration group aspiring for the position. The governor is said to have resolved to allow as many of them as are interested in the seat to test their popularity at the party’s primary. Already, his deputy, Rear Admiral John Jonah (rtd), his former campaign Director-General, Chief Fred Agbedi, and member representing Ekeremor-Sagbama Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives have picked their nomination forms. The danger, however, is that the members of his Restoration group could end up splitting their votes and putting an architect President Goodluck Jonathan is said to be backing for the position at an advantage. A former managing director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NNDC), Timi Alaibe, is also said to be waiting in the wings for the coveted seat
