Tutor-General/Permanent Secretary (TGPS) of Lagos District I Dr. Oluwafolayimika Ayandele has said the government will partner organisations with passion for girl-child education. She said it would promote the right values, good conduct and character, as well as academic excellence. Ayandele, who spoke yesterday while opening the Fourth edition of the 2019 Summer Leadership Camp organised by a non-government organisation (NGO), Ornament of Grace and Virtue Initiative, at Government College, Iyana-Ipaja, said the government would only collaborate with those that have passion for the girl-child and children. The tutor general said the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration promised to get the best out of children. She said it would priotise education, but urged pupils, especially girls, to offer themselves as service to humanity. The TGPS said Education District I had collaborated with NGOs, adding that the motive was to ensure that the character of pupils is modelled. Chief Executive Officer of Ornament of Grace and Virtue Initiative Mrs. Kolade Olubusola said the aim of the camp was to train girls to assist their parents. She said: “We cannot afford to leave everything to parents. Many of them cannot even afford qualitative education. Those who have the resources don’t have time. This is the gap we want to bridge.” Kolade,  speaking on the theme: “Who am I”, said it was necessary to let the girl-child know what they are good at, work on their talent and key it into their career to do it well. Other speakers at the event are Philip Yaro, an engineer, represented by Dr. Friday Onamson and Miss Collins Otuseso.
