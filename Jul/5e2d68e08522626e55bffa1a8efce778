The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has appointed Dr. Henry Chukwudumeme Nkemadu as its new Director,Public Affairs (DPA). His appointment, according to the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, is in line with the Commission’s policy of putting round pegs in round holes for optimum delivery of responsibilities especially now that the stakes are getting higher for the Commission’s regulatory oversight. “Dr. Henry has had a rewarding opportunity of traversing the entire telecom regulatory ecosystem, which experience he will find handy as the new spokesman of the Commission.” Prof. Danbatta added. A well groomed professional, Nkemadu who is a consummate communicator, joined the NCC as Principal Manager in Business Development in September 2003 with responsibilities as strategist for the department, evaluating, regulating and managing all departmental requirements. He handled proposals on capacity building initiatives in liaison with international agencies for capacity building. He became a full Director, a few weeks ago. He, holds multiple degrees/certificates in several disciplines from three universities both in Nigeria and the United States of America (USA). He has transversed several departments within the NCC and garnered wide and varied experience in the workings of the commission. He was Deputy Director/Head, Special Intervention Projects of the Project Department where he superintended the initiation, planning, execution, monitoring/control and close out of intervention projects carried out by the Commission.
