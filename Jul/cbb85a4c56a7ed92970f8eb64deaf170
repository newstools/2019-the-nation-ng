Cameroon coach Clarence Seedorf has highlighted two things Indomitable Lions must do as they prepare to face Super Eagles in the round of on Saturday. The Dutchman who is managing a national team for the first time, said the lions must maintain in tempo in terms of defense but must combine the barricade with ability to create and take chances” “We have to improve a few details, especially in the last part of the field, to be a bit smarter, create more chances,” he said. That the team did not concede any goal in the group stage according to him is an indication that Lions are doing well by making it difficult for opponents to create chances. Seedorf who made career 640 appearances for the seven different clubs he played for, scoring 100 goals, will be hoping to outwit German tactician Gernot Rohr when both teams battle for a place in the last eight in Alexandria. Goal scoring appear to be a common denominator for both teams as both teams  only managed to score two goals in three matches of the group stage. Seedorf who took over the lions last year however remains optimistic that the side will up their game against perennial rivals Nigeria. A number of soccer fans who spoke to Sportinglife.ng ahead of Saturday’s encounter avoided predicting possible scoreline with many confessing that Eagles defeat by debutant Barea of Madagascar came as a shocker forcing them to adopt a wait and see posture towards round of 16 matches. “On paper you could say the Eagles have an edge but with the defeat against Madagascar you never can say when a blunder will occur,” they said, Wednesday.
