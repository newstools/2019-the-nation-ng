Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai has expressed support for the House of Assembly over rejection of one of the Commissioner-nominees. The Assembly presided over by Speaker Aminu Shagali on Thursday rejected Alhaji Aliyu Jaafar, who was nominated by the Governor to serve as the Commissioner for Agriculture. Shagali said Jaafar was rejected for his consistent criticism of Governor El-Rufai’s administration. The Governor, in reaction to the development on Friday while swearing-in the rest of the nominees confirmed by the Assembly, said, he was in support of the decision. He however said he will be making another nomination for the position very soon. “We thank the Kaduna State House of Assembly for prompt confirmation and scrutinisation of our Commissioners. We note that the House was unable to confirm one of our nominees and we will shortly be proposing a replacement. “I think they did the right thing, because it is their job to check whatever we are doing. No one is perfect, we can never always get it right. That is why our partnership with the state house of assembly is a healthy one. And we support every decision they take,” El-Rufai said.
