Actress and singer Dayo Amusa has come out to speak on the opinion of being regarded as a strong woman. Posting an image from a photo shoot, the actress wrote on her Instagram account: “MY STRENGTH, Being strong doesn’t mean I can carry weight. “I can persevere when things get tough. I can dig deep into my faith & know all things will work together for good. “I pray for more strength & I seek help in times of need. I have a strong sense of who I am therefore; I am not swayed by public opinion. I protect my joy and peace; I take care of my relationship with my family & friends. “I stand up for what is right even if I have to stand all by myself. I do not pretend to be strong. I am capable of doing a lot of things but not foolish enough to do more than I am able. I cry & have bad days too. In fact, bad days only make me stronger because I drop my pride long enough to learn what life is trying to teach me. Though I do not say yes to everyone just because they ask. On the contrary, I am the type of woman who uses the word “no” to keep her priorities straight. “I would say NO! I can’t take on that extra responsibility. No, I will not allow you to speak to me that way. No, you cannot invade my privacy or disrupt my peace. It doesn’t mean I walk around with a chip on my shoulder or bitterness on my tongue. I can and do show tenderness and vulnerability most times.”
