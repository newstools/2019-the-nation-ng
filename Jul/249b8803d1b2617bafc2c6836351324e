Business mogul Femi Otedola went on vacation to Monaco with his daughters Tolani, Temi and Ifeoluwa popularly known as DJ Cuppy. The wealthy family flew into San Remo, Italy for one hour to buy ice cream on Thursday and Nigerians on social media are in awe of such display. However, Femi Otedola and his daughters shared snaps from their visits to Monaco which includes golf playing at Mont Garlo golf club. The Otedolas are not strangers to going on holiday. Well, quite a number of Nigerians are not used to this luxury and they expressed so much in the comment section of the Otedolas. Many prayed to God to bless them while some others made jokes. DJ Cuppy took to her social media to reveal how she and her dad had so much fun in Italy, appreciating Italians that greeted them in French. Few weeks ago, a Nigerian reacted to one of the post on Femi Otedola’s Instagram page asking if he ever goes to work. The billionaire replied: ‘’as an entrepreneur, my role is to ensure that I hire a competent team to run my business affairs without my physical presence and of course one that outlives me. Mine is to nuture the team to maximize shareholder value.”
