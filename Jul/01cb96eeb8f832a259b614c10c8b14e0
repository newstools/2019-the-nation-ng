The United States (U.S.) said has introduced a new initiative designed to boost trade and investment between it and Africa. The initiative, Prosper Africa, it explained is a reflection of the U.S. government’s belief that open and transparent economies should determine the future of African countries. It also said technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) held the key to the economic transformation of Nigeria and other countries. Its Public Affairs Officer, Russell Brooks, who spoke in Lagos during the Nigerian Youth Drone Academy Workshop at Cedar STEM & Entrepreneurship Hub, Jibowu, Yaba, said STEM education is a big priority for the U.S. government. “We believe that every student throughout the world deserves a high-quality education in STEM in order to enhance their individual possibilities as well as their ability to contribute to making our world a better place,” he said. In a statement, the government said Prosper Africa will also expand mutually beneficial trade and investment, increase the self-reliance of African economies, grow the middle class in African countries and improve business climates across the continent.
