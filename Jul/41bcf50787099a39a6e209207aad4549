Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, will soon become a dual mode university. The management of the institution has entered into a partnership with the Commonwealth of Learning (COL), in Vancouver, Canada, with a view to making FUOYE run both conventional as well open distance learning (ODL) programmes. Commonwealth of Learning is an intergovernmental organisation established by the Commonwealth Heads of Government in 1988, to encourage the development and sharing of open learning and distance education knowledge, and resources. Speaking with reporters in OyeEkiti weekend, the Vice-Chancellor of FUOYE, Prof Kayode Soremekun, said running ODL would expand the scope of scholarship around the globe through access to university education and exchange programme among commonwealth universities. Soremekun said CLO was funded mainly to enhancing the quality of educational programmes of the Commonwealth  nations,  COL hosts a biennial pan-commonwealth forum on open learning (PCF),  and Excellence  in distance awards programme.  He said Nigeria as a prominent member-nation of the Commonwealth has representatives on COL’s Board of Governors, adding that this enables the country’s fast growing academic institutions to have linkages with the organisation on open learning and distance programme. Soremekun said: “I have visited COL and held series of meetings with the organisation and the matters discussed were focused on developing FUOYE with regards to quality assurance, employability and the strategy to transit FUOYE into a dual mode university. “Dual mode means that we are complementing our existing orthodox programmes with the Distance Learning Programme.”
