THE Sokoto zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said that not less than three corrupt cases have been recorded between January and June. Head in charge of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states, Mr Abdullahi Lawal, stated this at the 3rd African Anti Corruption Day of the agency. The annual event is aimed at sensitising and creating awareness to the public against corrupt tendencies and acts which were capable of jeopardising development. According to Lawal, already there were other cases in Court ranging up to 5 which suspects would soon be arraigned. “So far we have recovered 3 vehicles and cash worth N70 million as well property aimed at securing forfeiture order”, he disclosed. The agency’s zonal boss however cautioned the public to be wary of fraudsters as the commission continues to strengthen its collaborative measures with other countries. “You recall that our Chairman, Magu was recently awarded with an honour because our country is doing fantastically good at fighting corruption by getting information through petitions and other intelligence sources,” he explained.
