Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has directed the newly reinstated eight local government chairmen, their deputies and elected councilors to return to their respective offices. Fayemi also directed that the remaining eight local governments be administered by Coordinating Directors, pending further resolutions by the State House of Assembly. The Ekiti House of Assembly had last week directed their reinstatement following the adoption of the reports of the House Committee of Public Petitions submitted by it Chairman, Mr Adegoke Olajide. The Assembly had on December, 18, 2018 suspended indefinitely all the 16 LGAs Chairmen and 177 Councilors to pave way for forensic audit of the councils’ account over alleged financial impropriety. They were indicted by the report of the Assembly Public Account Committee saddled with the responsibility of probing finances of the Councils. The chairmen after being cleared by the assembly refused to resume, claiming the governor is yet to give a directive to that effect. According to a statement on Thursday by the Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Akin Oyebode, the reinstated Council Chairmen and the Coordinating Directors are to resume work at their respective local government councils on Monday, 15th, July 2019. The  reinstated Council Chairmen are Hon. Bamisile Clement (Ado local Government), Hon. Abiodun Dada (Ijero), Hon Dapo Olagunju (Irepodun/Ifelodun), Hon. Ayodeji Daniel ( Ekiti West). Others include Hon. Akin Ogidi (Gbonyin), Hon. Femi Ayeni (Moba), Hon Omolase Joseph Olanrewaju (Ekiti South West), Hon. Olukayode Abiola Racheal (Ikole). The Coordinating Directors for the remaining eight local governments include Mr Aluko Ayodele (Oye), Mr Aina Sesan (Ilejemeje), Mr Adeola W.A. (Ido-Osi), Andero S.O. (Ekiti East), Others are Engr Ogunsakin G.T. (Ise-Orun), Engr Bayo Akinola (Emure), Mrs Toba Ojo ( Ikere) and Mr. Awopetu Lawrence Omotunde (Efon).
