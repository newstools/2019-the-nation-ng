The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has warned corps members against lobbying to be relocated out of the states they are deployed for their one-year national service. The Director of Corps Mobilization at the NYSC Directorate Headquarters in Abuja, Mrs Nnenna Ukonu, gave the advice on Thursday while addressing corps members undergoing their three-week orientation course in Umunya Camp in Anambra State. The director described lobbying for relocation as a risky venture which many later regretted. “Avoid lobbying to be relocated out of the state. It may end up in someone lobbying out his or luck or destiny,” she said. Mrs Ukonu urged the NYSC members to settle down and imbibe the entrepreneurial spirit of their host communities. “I challenge you to seize the opportunity being offered by the NYSC skills acquisition to upgrade yourself towards self-reliance at the end of your service year,” she added. Cautioning against incessant and unauthorized journeys, the director urged the corps members to use the various information technology platforms to regularly communicate with their parents and loved ones. The NYSC State Coordinator Kehinde Aremu thanked the director for the visit. He informed her that 2,220 corps members, comprising 1,080 men and 1,140 women were on camp. The state coordinator described their conduct as satisfactory.
