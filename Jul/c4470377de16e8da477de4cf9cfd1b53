His tax liability on profits made in businesses that shot his assets to that level should also be confirmed. The guy is putting a noose on his own neck! — Ezeaka Chidozie Ishola Buharideen (@Ezeakachidozie) July 16, 2019  Seyi makinde has shown every dick tom and harry that he's a different brand of politician. The meaning of integrity!Integrity can only come through transparency.I'm in total awe. — Michael X (@Michael57313270) July 16, 2019  Seyi Makinde is a testament that as a young person, you need to pursue your career and really try to make it before venturing into politics. You necessarily don’t have to be a nuisance supporting and cheering all the crap sold by the Politicians on here. Think and face your life. — Lanre Aluko (@laruchi007) July 16, 2019  A thief like you, can you honestly declear your assets publicly like Seyi Makinde did…. — Ikenna Ijomanta (@ijomanta_ikenna) July 16, 2019  I meet someone who Seyi Makinde worked under in hi NYSC days in SPDC today. According to him SPDC did not retain Seyi Makinde because they felt he was not good enough as a young engineer. He started his own company and employed his colleagues whom he did his — Anthony Dibie (@ighotasha) July 16, 2019  It's not about wat Seyi Makinde has declared, there's a need for the Code of Conduct Bureau to ascertain whether wat he declared is TRUE. Presumably, we know that's not realistic & quite unsual.So my question is "Wat has Seyi Makinde been up to that he's worth 48billion naira? — Chris Ayo Joseph (@officialchrisay) July 16, 2019  Seyi Makinde is the real Mr integrity you wish your MCM could be. — OYETUNJI (@iam_TSLAM) July 16, 2019  Over 4 years later and we're still waiting for your self-acclaimed Mr integrity to make public his assets but Seyi Makinde is your problem. You don't expect everyone to be poor or lie about being poor, do you? Gov Seyi pepper them! — Oluwale Aderinto (@D_oluwale) July 16, 2019  Seyi Makinde is humble and he has good intentions but Nigeria problem and resistance to change will humble him. He should just focus on infrastructure so that he won’t be insulted and considered a failure after 2years. — Francis Olaiya (@francisoshoke) July 16, 2019
