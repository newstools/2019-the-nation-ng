Avala and Isioma are the two housemates that got evicted at BBNaija first Sunday eviction show held on July 8th, 2019. The two housemates left the house during a surprise double eviction. Avala and Isilomo faced eviction alongside two other housemates, Gedoni, Kafhi, because of their low Bet9ja coin count. Each of the housemates had 80 Bet9ja coins and Biggie put them up for the Marble challenge during the live show. The marble challenge had the housemates roll the marble from one end to another and drop it in a container. Unfortunately, Avala and Isilomo had the lowest marbles in the bowl and were evicted immediately – leaving Gedoni and Kafhi to return to the house. Meanwhile Big Brother, a.k.a ‘Biggy’, is yet to reveal what is in store for Omashola and Ike as they too faced possible eviction following a heated argument over the theft of Omashola’s Bet9ja coins. The BBNaija live eviction show on Sunday also featured an energetic performance from Afro-pop artist, Mayorkun who thrilled the audience with his latest hit single ‘True’ and his other hit singles, ‘Che Che’ and ‘Bobo’ whilst DJ Exclusive entertained the crowd as the night’s resident DJ. There are now only 19 housemates in the house.
