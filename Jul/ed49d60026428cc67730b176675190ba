The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has said the former Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Biodun Fatoyinbo, will be sanctioned, if found guilty of the rape allegations against him. The fellowship said it was saddened and disturbed by the allegations of criminal conduct and serial impropriety against the pastor. It said the alleged misconduct was antithetical to the tenets of Christianity and a violent breach of the trust that ought to exist between members of the congregation and a minister of the Gospel. PFN President Dr. Felix Omobude issued a statement yesterday in Benin, the Edo State capital, in reaction to the allegations of rape against Fatoyinbo. He said the body was shocked at the allegations, adding that they are mostly criminal. Omobude said: “We strongly condemn this ignoble and bastardy conduct, as alleged against Pastor Fatoyinbo. Our prayers, thoughts and support are with all those who have fallen victim, as have been reported. “PFN strongly believes in the pursuit of truth and will ensure that truth is unveiled in this whole matter and appropriate sanctions served. “The PFN hereby warns Pentecostal pastors, who feel they can live carelessly and take undue advantage of their congregants, that PFN will not shield anyone who crosses the line. “The PFN calls on all concerned while expressing their views over this sad issue to be peaceful and have some respect for the Kingdom.”
