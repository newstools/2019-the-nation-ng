TWO men were on Monday arraigned at a Yaba Chief
Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing 75 litres of diesel engine oil valued
at N46,500. Usman Nuhu, 32, a guard, and Celestine Klotoe, 37, a driver,
pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said the defendants
committed the offences, on July 18, at 51B, Adekunle Bisi Street, GRA, Ogudu,
Lagos. She alleged that the defendants stole the oil from the store
of their employer, Specific Tools and Techniques Ltd. Olaluwoye said they broke into the store with a master key
and carried away the oil in a wheel barrow. “My lord, the whole thing was captured on the company’s
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera. “The second defendant, Klotoe, had even started selling the
oil to people at his friend’s mechanic garage. “It was the company’s Accountant, Mr. Ojo Adeyemi, who saw
the theft on the CCTV video and reported at the station,’’ Olaluwoye said. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendants
N100,000 bail, with two sureties each in the like sum. The sureties, she said, must be employed with evidence of
three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on September 11.
