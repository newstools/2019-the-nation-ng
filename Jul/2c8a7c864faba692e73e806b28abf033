A 20-year-old guard, Michael Nwaogwu, has appeared at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing N2,385 from an offering box. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Oriabure said the defendant committed the offence at midnight on July 17, at St. Dennis Catholic Church, Akoka, Bariga, Lagos. He alleged that another guard, Mr. Musa Ayay, discovered that the offering box was tampered with. Oriabure said the defendant confessed when Ayay confronted him. Ayay alleged that the money was recovered from the defendant’s underwear. Magistrate Oluwatoyin Ojuromi granted the defendant N30,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. One of the sureties, she said, must be a relation. The case continues on August 19.
