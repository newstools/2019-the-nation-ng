The draft National Diaspora Policy, which is to drive the country’s engagement with Nigerians in Siaspora, has been validated. The mission of the policy is to empower Nigerians in Diaspora as change agents for the development of Nigeria through promoting a framework for them to maximise their potentials in capital, knowledge and networks. The validation was done at a stakeholders’ meeting yesterday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Presenting the validated draft, the Executive Chairman of Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa said the goal of the policy is to have a means of constructive engagement with Nigerians in the Diaspora for sustainable national development. “It is about oil. What the Diasporans send to Nigeria every year is more than what we get from oil. So, our biggest asset is our human export. Now, we are talking about brain drain, brain gain; we are talking about brain circulation. So, it’s about circulating this brain, this noble talent that we have abroad for the good and development of our great nation, Nigeria. “We, as a people, are very blessed by God: brilliant, energetic, resourceful. But beyond all and most importantly, we stand out with the energy we see as Nigerians. So, it is about working with Nigerians abroad and Nigerians at home to build the country of our dreams.”
