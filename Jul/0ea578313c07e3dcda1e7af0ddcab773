Lagos State Government will today begin another round of polio immunisation for children, Primary Health Care Board Permanent Secretary Dr Tayo Lawal has said. Speaking at the weekend on the preparation for the exercise, Lawal said to be immunised were children from ages 0-5. They will get Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), Children between three months and five years will receive Fractional Inactivated Polio Vaccine (FIPV). The board, Lawal said,Â  would launch the National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDS) National Immunisation Programme today at Eti-Osa East Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Secretariat, Sangotedo. He lamented that Nigeria is the only African country and one of the three in the world endemic for the wild polio virus, which must be eradicated. Nigeria, he said, was on the verge of receiving another polio free certificate, adding that to achieve this, states, including Lagos, have been mandated to get rid of the wild polio virus. Lawal said Lagos had just concluded three rounds of outbreak response after isolating type2 from water samples in Lagos Mainland, Mushin, Ajeromi and Apapa. He said the National Immunisation Vaccine would also be administered at health facilities across the state. Lawal urged parents and guardians to bring their kids for the exercise because it is safe and protects them from polio.
