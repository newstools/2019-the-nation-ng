Another group of 37 governorship aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday backed the decision of the National Working Committee(NWC) of the party to approve indirect primary to select its candidate for the November 16 governorship election in the state. The group under the auspices of Coalition of Kogi APC Aspirants said they were confident of beating Governor Yahaya Bello at the primary because they believe that they have control of the delegates. Spokesman of the group, Comrade Edime Godwin Amade, said the group of 20 aspirants kicking against the indirect mode of primary were working for the downfall of the party in the state, pointing out that the National Working Committee should not allow the group to pull the wool over their eyes. He claimed that the fact that the state governor has built the party in the state to an enviable height is not an indication that he would win the primary and pick the party ticket. He said further that any idea that they will step down for Governor Bello should be discountenanced as they are already putting their resources together to collect the nomination form.
