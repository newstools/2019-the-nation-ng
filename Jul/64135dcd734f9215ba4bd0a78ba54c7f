The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate for Ovia Federal Constituency seat, Edo state,Â  Barr. Omosede Igbinedion, have closed their case at the National and State Assemblies Election Petitions Tribunal after calling 19 witnesses. A total of 71 witnesses were scheduled to be called to testify but they could only call 19 before the expiration of the time allotted by the tribunal. Barr. Igbinedion had in her petition asked the tribunal to declare her winner of the election on grounds that the APC candidate, Mr Dennis Idahosa, did not score majority of lawful votes. At the resumed hearing of the case on Tuesday, INEC and APC rejected attempt by the petitioner to get the tribunal to admit a document of complaint lodged by one of its witnesses. Counsel to the petitioner, A. I. Asarenkhoe, urged the tribunal to administer the document containing complaint to the Electoral Officer (EO) in ward 4 Unit 10 and the Police DPO at Iguobazuwa, lodged by a witness, Chief Adele Sunday. Sunday, who was on oath, said the letter of complaint arosed from the irregularities he noticed during the conduct of the National Assembly elections in the area. Counsel to INEC, J. O. Ehiabhi, who urged the tribunal to reject the document said the name of the person who acknowledged the document was not known to INEC or any of its officials. Ehiabi pointed out that the document was a photocopy and not certified by any official of the electoral body. Counsel to the second and third respondents, Enahoro Aghomon and C. T. Aigborueghian joined Ehiabhi to reject the document. But Asarenkhoe argued that the document was listed as part of the documents to be tendered as part of the petition. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice O. Ogundana, announced that the APC would start calling its witnesses from July 26. Justice Ogundana said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has no witness to call. He deferred ruling on the administrability of the document to the final judgement day.
