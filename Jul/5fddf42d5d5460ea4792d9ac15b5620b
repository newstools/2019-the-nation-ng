The Police in Lagos on Wednesday arraigned a Travel Agent, Oluwasegun Gbeleye, 34, before a Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged N2.7 million Australian visa fraud. Gbeleye, whose address was not provided, appeared before the court on a four-count charge of conspiracy, forgery, fraud and stealing. He however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Oluyemisi Adelaja, granted him bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Adelaja ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She however, adjourned the case till Aug. 12 for mention. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Anthonia Osayande, alleged that the defendant defrauded Mr Prince Nnadozie, sometime in March 2018 at Randle General Hospital, Lagos. Osayande said that the defendant fraudulently obtained N2.7 million from Nnadozie, with a promise to secure five Australian visas and work permit for him, but failed to do so. She alleged that the defendant made his client five fake Australian visas and converted the money to his personal use. The prosecutor said that when Nnadozie knew that he had been swindled and asked for his money back, the defendant insisted that he was still working on the visas. Osayande told the court that the defendant perpetrated the crime with the aid of Rosemary Chichi, still at large. The offences contravene Sections 287, 314, 365 (1) and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes three years imprisonment for stealing. (NAN)
