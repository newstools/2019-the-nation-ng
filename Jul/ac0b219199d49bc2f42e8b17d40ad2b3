Just like he did at the China Open, Arna Quadri repeated the feat again at the Korea Open as the Nigerian edged out his German counterpart to set up a second-round clash against the recently crowned World number one – China’s Xu Xin. As one of the top 16 seeds, Quadri was set up in the first round against Germany’s Benedikt Duda and after losing the first game with wide margin of 2-11, Quadri regained his rythmn to walloped the European. To end the dream of the German southpaw, Quadri won 4-1 (2-11, 11-8, 13-11, 11-9, 11-3) to advance to the second round where he will battle the Chinese superstar. Quadri’s opponent in the second round and the New World no.1 Xu Xin came through his opening round fixture with little to worry about, knocking Japan’s Yuki Hirano out of the running (11-6, 11-1, 11-2, 11-4). Defeated at the opening hurdle last time out in Sapporo – fast forward a couple of weeks and Japan’s Tomokazu Harimoto has managed to avoid the same fate in Busan, posting a 4-0 win at Jon Persson’s expense (11-7, 11-6, 4-11, 11-5, 11-7). Hong Kong’s Wong Chun Ting needed five games to seal his spot in the last 16 with Slovak opponent Wang Yang falling short (13-11, 11-7, 6-11, 11-7, 11-4). One of the breakout stars in recent weeks, especially for his fine run at the 2019 Japan Open, but Lin Yun-Ju’s campaign in Busan has been halted at the first attempt after the no.14 seed from Chinese Taipei fell to China’s Wang Chuqin 4-0 (11-6, 11-8, 11-9, 11-9). The case for two is spreading across Busan as another national pair had encouraging results, seeing Sweden’s Kristian Karlsson and Mattias Falck emerge victorious over Jun Mizutani of Japan and India’s Sharath Kamal Achanta.
