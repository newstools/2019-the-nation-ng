The Oyo state House of Assembly says the three bills sent to it by the state governor, Seyi Makinde, will be given accelerated hearing, describing them as important, germane and pivotal to addressing critical issues facing the state. The bills, according to the lawmakers, are: the Anti-grazing Bill, the Anti-corruption Bill and the Investment Promotion Bill. Speaking on behalf of the lawmakers, the Speaker, Right Honourable Adebo Ogundoyin, made the disclosure yesterday while featuring on a live interview programme on an Ibadan-based radio station, Beats FM, Ibadan. According to the Speaker, the anti-grazing bill will address one of the most controversial issues in the country and put many minds to rest. He said, “It is good that the presidency has eventually suspended the Rural Grazing Areas project popularly called RUGA Settlement. “The different reactions that trailed the announcement of RUGA project were indications of how sensitive the issue is. The anti-grazing bill will be painstakingly deliberated upon by the members of the ninth Oyo Assembly at its plenary.” On the anti-corruption bill, the Speaker said the house will help actualise the dream of the governor in having an anti-graft agency which will look into cases of mismanagement, fraud and embezzlement of public funds and other related matters in the state. “Governor Seyi Makinde is demonstrating the resolve of his government to run a corrupt free administration and the establishment of an anti-graft agency in the state is enough a warning to everyone directly or indirectly working with him.
