The principal suspect in the murder of a 25-year-old tricycle operator, Chidibere Okechukwu, has been arrested by the police in Anambra State. The deceased, Chidi Mbgeanya, was reportedly shot in the head and killed last on Tuesday at Umudioka around 8am. The suspect was said to have snatched a tricycle from the deceased, leaving him in a pool of blood. Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed, who confirmed the arrest, disclosed that the suspect, alleged to have been previously convicted for a similar offence, had confessed to the crime. He said: “Detectives attached to Dunukofia, Ogbunike, in conjunction with a vigilance group, cordoned off the area following the incident and launched a manhunt for the perpetrators of the dastardly act. They subsequently arrested the principal suspect, Chidibere Okechukwu, aka EWETE OKU.” Mohammed also confirmed the arrest of a 25-year-old man, Obi Chinonso, who specialised in handbag and phone snatching at Upper Iweka in Onitsha. He said the suspect was arrested by “Puff Adder” operatives in conjunction with a surveillance team attached to Awada Division. Mohammed said: “The suspect with other members of his gang on the run attacked and dispossessed Michael Ezeala of 11, Onyekwere Street, Awada of N180,000, a techno phone K9 valued at N39,000 and other valuables.” He said both suspects were assisting the police with information that could help arrest their fleeing accomplices.
