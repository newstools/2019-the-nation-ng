MTN Nigeria yesterday said its subsidiary, Yello Digital Financial Services Limited (YDFS) has been granted a full Super Agent Licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The
licence will enable the telco to convert its existing airtime agents and
recruit other small businesses to distribute financial services and scale the
launch of its fintech strategy. YDFS received approval in principle for
its Super-Agent Licence in December last year and has been conducting a pilot
project since then to meet the conditions of a full licence. The successful
pilot has now led to the granting of a full licence under which YDFS will
distribute financial services across the country. Commenting on the licence, its CEO Ferdi
Moolman, said: “We are very pleased that YDFS has been granted a Super-Agent
Licence, which enables us to extend access to financial services to a much
broader group of Nigerians. This forms part of our commitment to contribute
towards the achievement of Nigeria’s financial inclusion goals. Through the
network established by YDFS MTN is in a position to broaden the availability of
financial services for the under-served across the country. “This marks a very
important first step in leveraging our infrastructure to scale our Fintech
initiatives. We have also applied for a Payment Service Bank Licence, which
will enable us in time to offer a broader and deeper range of financial
services to those communities and we remain hopeful we will receive approval
shortly.”
