The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Enugu State chapter, on Thursday asked residents of the State to ignore rumour making the rounds that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of the State has donated some land for the controversial Ruga programme. There were claims in some circles that the governor donated some hectres of land for the settlement project at some communities in the State. But addressing journalists, the Secretary of CAN in the State, Dr. Joseph Ajujungwa said checks by the Christian body showed that no such thing happened. He warned rumour mongers to desist from stoking unnecessary tension in the State, noting that such would do no one any good. He said that “we have taken time to investigate some of the allegations against the governor on this Ruga, claiming that he has given land for the project. I am assuring residents of the State that it is not true; we have investigated, we have done everything we are supposed to do and we found out that the allegation is false. The claim is from the pit of hell, it cannot be substantiated. “How many hectres of land do we have in Enugu that some can come out and say the Governor has given out 31 hectres? “We, therefore, use this opportunity to call on Enugu residents to carry on their normal businesses and forget such propaganda.” Ajujungwa, who is also the National Chairman, Christian Enlightenment and Welfare Organization, CEWO, said “the most annoying part of it is that those circulating this fake news are not in this State; they stay in their comfort zone and create unnecessary tension here. “Their attempt is to cause a breach of peace, to truncate the harmony we are enjoying in this State, just to seek political relevance.” “The governor has assured us that he is not different from other Southeast governors; he is on the same page with them. “We have interfaced with him and he told us bluntly that such a thing never happened,” Ajujungwa added.
