Big Brother Naija housemate, Mike has lamented Tacha’s attitude telling her that housemates were excited about her eviction. Mike, speaking as Tacha and Seyi returned to the house after their fake eviction, told Tacha that he never liked her energy while she was in the house. He said: “Tacha I’m going to keep it hundred with you before you left, I didn’t like your energy and when you left, I felt elated even the house could agree,” Mike said. Tacha, responding, said she was not surprised, adding that either way she would still remain in the house till ‘99th day’. Big brother had on Sunday placed Seyi and Tacha on fake evictions. They were later taken to a secret room where they spent three days together. In the secret room, they played by rules clearly spelt out on a piece of paper and handed to them by Big Brother. However, Biggie on Wednesday asked the housemates to prepare a meal and get ready to welcome two celebrity guests. To their surprise, Tacha and Seyi were the guests.
