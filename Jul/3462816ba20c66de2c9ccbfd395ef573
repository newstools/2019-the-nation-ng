Determined to rid the main and Kobo campuses of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai (IBBUL), in Niger State, of  violence and other security challenges, the school management has organised a five-day workshop for its security personnel and cadet-officers. The training had the theme: Tackling security challenges In tertiary institutions. Declaring the workshop open, vice-chancellor of the institution, Prof Muhammad Nasir Maiturare, reaffirmed management’s commitment to training and retraining of workers. This, according to Maiturare, is with a view to getting them acquainted with latest trends in the discharge of their duties. He noted that workers in the Security Unit have a major role to play in creating a conducive environment for teaching and learning. Maiturare noted that in light of the prevailing insecurity across the country, regular capacity-building workshops by public institutions have become necessary. He assured of the competence of DEEPCOVER Guards, a security outfit contracted for the training. He said: “I have no doubt that DeepCover Guards Limited will deliver on the training’s mandates. They will educate our security cadets on the global trend of intelligence-gathering, policing and latest crime-control strategies. We appreciate the good works of DeepCover Guard, who are IBBUL’s life partner when it comes to providing maximum security for our staff and students,” he said. Maiturare assured that members who performed brilliantly during the training, and thereafter reflect the knowledge they gained on their job, would be duly rewarded. On his part the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the security company Maj. Gen. Shehu Abdulkadir, praised Maiturare and the entire management board for organising and sponsoring the training.
