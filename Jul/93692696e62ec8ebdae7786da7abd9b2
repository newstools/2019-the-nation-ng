The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has warned brokers against doing business with weak insurance companies. This is coming on the heels of moves by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) to strengthen the insurance industry by mandating existing insurance companies to inject capital through a recapitalisation exercise. NCRIB President  Mr Shola Tinubu while speaking on the recapitalisation of insurance companies, urged members of the council to be mindful of companies that are weak and would not be able to meet up with the regulator’s recapitalisation requirement. He spoke at the June 2019 Edition of NCRIB Members’ Evening hosted by NSIA Insurance Plc in Lagos. He said news have been making rounds that some brokers still indulge in placing businesses with companies that are challenged. He said: “It is no more news that NAICOM has jerked up the minimum paid-up capital of Insurance Companies in Nigeria. The new capital base requires that companies that want to remain in Life Business should raise their minimum paid up capital base from N2 billion to a minimum of N8 billion; General Insurance Companies from N3 billion to N10 billion, Composite Insurance Companies from N5 billion to N18 billion, while Re-Insurance Companies will require a Paid Up capital base of N20 billion from N10 billion. “As insurance brokers, we cannot shy away from the fact that this directive will adversely affect the entire industry. As a proactive Council, we are critically examining the implications and possible solution to the effect the implementation would have on our members. He further urged brokers to maximize the benefits of the Council’s relationship with NSIA Insurance Plc which he described as a frontline insurance company.
