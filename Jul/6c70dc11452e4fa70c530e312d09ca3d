Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Akwa Ibom have adjudged the nomination of Senator Godswill Akpabio into the federal executive council as a plus to the party and Nigeria as a whole. The APC governorship candidate in the March 23 election, Obong Nsima Ekere, a former secretary to Akwa Ibom state government, Sir Etekamba Umoren and a former works commissioner, Mr. Don Etiim said this in separate interviews with the Nation in Uyo Wednesday. They were unanimous in stating that Akpabio as minister will add value to the change agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. They also assured that he (Akpabio) would replicate the uncommon developmental strides he achieved while as governor of Akwa Ibom between 2007 and 2015. Ekere said, ”Akpabio’s nomination as minister is a good one and very good for the party because he has strength. He is going to add value to the party. ”He did very well as governor and later as a senator. He set a record as a first timer to become senate minority leader. So we can say that he (Akpabio) is a man of uncommon feats. ”It is our firm belief that he will achieve uncommon feats in the federal executive council even as I thank President Muhammadu Buhari for choosing a worthy and capable hand in the person of Senator Akpabio to represent Akwa Ibom in his cabinet”. In the same vein, a former SSG, Sir Umoren said Akpabio envisaged emergence as minister will position the APC to take over the reins of governance in Akwa Ibom. ”It is not how long but how well. Within the short period Akpabio moved to the APC over 300 people defected from the PDP and other parties to the APC. ”We in the state, particularly his ardent supporters are sure that APC in Akwa Ibom will be further strengthened because of the political inclusiveness and sagacity of Senator Akpabio to galvanize group interests,’’ he said.
