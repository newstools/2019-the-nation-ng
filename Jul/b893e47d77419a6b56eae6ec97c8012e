THE Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) has identified diversification as the key to addressing the challenges facing the economy Its President, Comrade Oyinkansola Olasanoye, said if the country diversifies the economy from oil, which represents 85 per cent of export earnings to agriculture, there is hope of great economic potential ahead. She said it was important that the three tiers of government- federal, states and local – initiate policies to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship and growth, which are the key priorities for many emerging economies in the world. She said there was need for the policymakers to strike a balance across sectors and initiate incentives that could sustain growth. “Strengthening public financial management is also critical to ensuring that revenue is used to improve basic service delivery for Nigerians, particularly in the health and education sectors, which are underserved, especially for rural population. “I do believe that designing and implementing reforms, which the government is undertaking to drive the growth processes, is particularly challenging as our policymakers attempt to strike a balance across sectors, firm size and incentives that can sustain growth in the nation’s economy,” Olasanoye said. She added that investing in human capital development would reduce stunts in the country. She said: “This is because stunting has multiple causes, and to address them all will require coordinated actions across multiple sectors such as health, social protection, education, sanitation among others.
