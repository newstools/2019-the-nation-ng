A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Chief Fola Dabo, has advised politicians to serve with dedication and integrity. Dabo spoke at his Igbekebo, headquarters of Ese-Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State home, when he received the Chairman of the party, Mr. Ade Adetimehin and members of the State Working Committee. The party elder emphasised that it takes integrity to win trust, confidence and consistent loyalty of the people. He said: “You must be passionate about serving the people; you must do this with integrity and sincerity. “You must be steadfast and promote selfless service to the people; positions and gains will come thereafter”. The party chieftain said the secret of his success in political sojourn was his foresight and “good philosophy about life”. Dabo urged the chairman to remain focused and be more committed to building the chapter, and ensure a united party ahead of future elections. “You must mend all fences within the party, and unite all members for them to be on one page, so that you can lead the State to another electoral success”, he admonished.
