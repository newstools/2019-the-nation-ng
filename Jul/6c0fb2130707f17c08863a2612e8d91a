Southern Sun Ikoyi joined the rest of the world in celebrating the tenth Nelson Mandela International Day by visiting an orphanage, gifts to children of the Arrows of God Orphanage in Ajah, Lagos. The Nelson Mandela International Day also popularly known as the Mandela Day is an annual call of celebration observed internationally to pay tribute to an exemplary individual for his values, legacy and contribution to society and humanity at large. As is tradition for Southern Sun Ikoyi over the last ten years in celebrating the memory of the global icon “Madiba”, the hotel paid its annual visit to the Arrows of God Orphanage, which  it adopted in bringing smiles upon the faces of the children and their careers through the donation of various items ranging from toys, activity books, textbooks, educational games, inspirational books and light refreshments to the delight of the children of the home. Speaking during the visit, Sales and Marketing Manager, Southern Sun Ikoyi, Ubong Nseobot, expressed delight on the warm reception received by the representatives of the hotel during the visit, as she used the opportunity to specially thank the management and care givers of the home for their unwavering, dedicated and committed service towards improving the children of the ward. She stated that, “the visit by the hotel is in furtherance with the hotel’s selfless acts in contributing meaningfully to the sustained growth, development and service to all within our community through little acts of kindness and love, an exemplary practice which Mandela’s life represented.” Ubong, further reiterated the hotel’s commitment in supporting the orphanage and its management, through social projects such as the much-anticipated annual golf day tournament whose proceeds have been used in supporting the orphanage daily needs in ensuring that children at the home do not live without the basic necessities of life. The Arrows of God Orphanage ,which is located in Ajah, Lagos State, cares for about 250 children in the ward. Through support and efforts by corporate social entities like Southern Sun Ikoyi, the administration is empowered with required tools and materials to supporting and developing the children into valuable members of our society.
