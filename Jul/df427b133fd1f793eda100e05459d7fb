Olanrewaju ‘God’s Power’ Durodola will face Michael Godwin today at the Squash Hall, Police College, Ikeja as he prepares to fight for another international cruiserweight title later in the year. Durodola wants another shot at an international belt after
he was knocked out in the second round by undefeated Michal Cieslak in their
Republic of Poland International Cruiser Title fight in May. With the undisputed cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk
forfeiting his titles to compete at the heavyweight division, the four major
belts in the cruiserweight division are up for grabs and Durodola wants a
chance to fight for them. His coach, Femi Babafemi disclosed to NationSport that
tonight’s fight is a warm-up fight for Durodola who will soon be back in Europe
to challenge for titles. He said: “Durodola’s fight with rookie Michael Godwin
is a warm-up fight ahead of returning to Europe for a shot at international
titles. “Oleksandr Usyk’s decision to fight in the heavyweight
division has left the field open for new champions to emerge and Durodola is
still among the top-ranked cruiser-weights in the world, so hopefully I believe
he would get his chance to challenge for a belt” Durodola, an ex-Olympian, and currently serving in the
Nigerian Police Force, has won 29 times (27 knockouts) and lost seven times
since his professional debut in 2011. He has held the World Boxing Council (WBC) Silver Cruiser,
WBC Continental Americas Cruiser, World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Africa
Cruiser Titles and is currently holds the World Boxing Federation (WBF) World
Cruiser belt after he beat Maroy Sadiki at the Federal Palace Hotel, Lagos last
year.
