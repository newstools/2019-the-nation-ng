Two persons were Wednesday killed in a bloody clash between the Toru-Orua and Ofoni communities in Sagbama Local Government Area, Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the killings unsettled both communities as youths armed with machetes and bottles engaged one another in a free-for-all. Sources said that troubled started following issues bordering on stealing of a commercial motorcycle. The two victims were said to have died in the process of stealing the motorcycle. One of the victims was said to have killed the owner of the motorcycle in his attempt to steal the vehicle from him. Angry kinsmen of the slain motorcyclists mobilised and traced the alleged killer in the neighbouring community and mobbed him to death. The action, it was gathered, led to a bloody conflict between youths from the two communities. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Asinim Butswat, confirmed the development said the police deployed operatives immediately and restored order in the area.
