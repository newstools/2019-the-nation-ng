Ex-Big Brother Naija 2019 housemate, Isilomo, has slammed fellow ex-housemates Kimoprah and Ella for claiming that Tacha has body and mouth odour. In an Instagram live video on Wednesday, Isilomo expressed disgust at the claims of the fellow evicted housemates, adding that their claim was meant to smear the reputation of Tacha before Nigerians. She said: “Why do you need to talk about body odour? I stayed in that house for a week. I personally know that Tacha doesn’t have body odour. “I never smelt any mouth odour. I have never smelt anything like that. “In fact, Tacha is very clean and trust me there are a few babes in that house that you can say are clean babes, trust me, I’m not even going to go there so let’s leave that gist. “I think it was disgusting, I think it was such a low blow, obviously she doesn’t have anything to say and so she’s just trying to just maybe blow off Tacha’s game. “Their comment is coming from a place of ‘painment’, it’s coming from their chest because Tacha is actually a clean babe.”   “Tacha is very clean. I personally never perceived any body odor ” Isilomo defends Tacha, says Ella’s claim came from ‘a place of painment’ A post shared by  Ije-Luv (@ijeomadaisy) on Jul 17, 2019 at 7:31am PDT
