BEAUTY queen and current Miss Port Harcourt City Humanity, Queen Okafor Chisom Michelle, has revealed why she embarked on her ‘One Child One Backpack’ campaign. She said having discovered that many young children are illiterate, she thought to encourage them to go to school by giving them backnpacks. “Millions of children in Nigeria are uneducated,” she said. “Statistics reveals that about 10.5 million children are out of school. Several of these indigent children who managed to go to schools provided by the government or charity organizations/foundations, are not properly equipped. This creates a lacuna that this project aims to alleviate. “’One Child One Backpack’ is a movement that has kicked off and I hope to carry out for as long as I live, God helping me.” So far, Queen Michelle has donated over 5, 000 bags and books to young students. She however, further revealed plans for her next project which she calls ‘Dine With Stars,’ which according to her is a picnic for the less privileged. Since she won the Miss Port Harcourt City Humanity last year, Michelle has been up and doing in her roles as a beauty queen. Although challenging, she stated that if given the opportunity to change anything in the pageant world she would “create a system and a body to govern pageantry in Nigeria, making sure it meets standards and get the amout of attention it deserves.”
