The victory of Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, at the Supreme Court in the case instituted over the primary election that produced him as Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) standard-bearer in the March 9, 2019 governorship election has been lauded by the state chapter of the PDP. The party, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Engr Akeem Olatunji, described the governor’s victory as a testimony to the transparent, free and fair primary election process that produced him and other PDP candidates in the state. The Oyo State PDP, in the statement in Ibadan, said the decision of the Supreme Court on the suit filed by Senator Ayoade Adeseun, vindicated the process that threw up the party’s candidates as credible and democratic. The party, which pledged its continued support to Makinde as the leader of the party, assured residents of the state that the administration of Governor Makinde would run the state with the same measure of credibility and transparency, ensuring that integrity, transparency and zero tolerance for corruption would be his watchwords. The Oyo PDP added the Makinde administration would be a clear departure from the era of impunity, indiscipline and lack of accountability known with the previous government, just as it noted that the present leadership of the party led by the State Chairman, Alhaji Kunmi Mustapha would make the PDP enviable in the state. “We want to assure the people of Oyo state that the government of the PDP will be a clear departure from the past when impunity, indiscipline, disorderliness and lack of cohesion were the order of the day,” the statement said.
