Dairy giant FrieslandCampina WAMCO and 2Scale are collaborating to deepen the inclusive model for local sourcing of fresh milk in Nigeria in line with FrieslandCampina WAMCO’s Dairy Development Programme (DDP). 2Scale is an incubator programme that manages a portfolio of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for inclusive business in gri-food sectors and industries. It offers a range of support services to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and farmer groups and partners, enabling them to produce, transform and supply quality food products. Through its DDP partnership with 2Scale, FrieslandCampina WAMCO has been deepening the dairy market by increasing the volume of fresh milk from empowered dairy farmers. It has also been creating employment by empowering women and youths both on-farm and off-farm; thus improving food safety and enhancing nutrition. The Netherlands’ Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Mrs. Sigrid Kaag, affirmed that given the consistent result FrieslandCampina WAMCO has recorded in local milk sourcing, Nigeria has the right partner to stimulate growth in the industry. Kaag made this statement  during  a visit to FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, where she confirmed the progress of FrieslandCampina WAMCO’s DDP. The Minister also witnessed the signing of the partnership extension agreement on the DPP between FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria PLC and International Fertiliser Development Center (IFDC), which represents 2Scale. While FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria PLC was represented by its Managing Director, Mr. Ben Langat, IFDC was represented by its President and CEO, Mr. Albin Hubscher.
