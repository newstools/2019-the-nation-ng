If Barcelona re-sign Neymar his first wage packet could end up going straight to the taxman and not to the player, El Mundo has revealed. Neymar has been hit with a €34million (£30m) unpaid tax bill and if he goes back to Spain, his earnings could be embargoed until the debt is settled. The outstanding sum is almost equivalent to what the player currently takes home in a year at Paris Saint-Germain. The Brazilian is also currently embroiled in a legal dispute with Barcelona over what he claims is an unpaid signing bonus from his previous stint at the club. If courts rule in his favour, that money could also go straight to pay his tax bill. When the Brazilian signed a new five-year contract at Barcelona in 2016 it included a renewal bonus payable in two instalments. In the summer of 2017, PSG signed him paying his €222m buy-out clause just weeks before the start of the new season. Neymar believed he was still entitled to the second half of his renewal bonus from the 2016 contract, but claims Barcelona never paid it. The legal wrangling over the bonus has rumbled on since his departure. If Barcelona are forced by the courts to pay Neymar the money this will also go straight into the public purse and not Neymar’s pocket.
