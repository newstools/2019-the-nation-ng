The Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) is clearing the Adeniji-Adele Road canal. It urged residents to think of making money from recyclable items, instead of dumping them in canals. The agency, in a statement yesterday in Ikeja by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Mrs. Folashade Kadiri, said the clearance followed an executive order on zero tolerance for reckless waste disposal, signed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The statement said: “We embark on this campaign pursuant to the executive order signed by Governor Sanwo-Olu to pave the way for a cleaner and healthier Lagos. This shows total commitment of the government to environmental sustainability.” It said the exercise would be extended to other clogged drainages to ensure that no part of the metropolis was left behind in the quest to ensure a clean environment. “The clearing of the canal will be extended to other clogged canals. The exercise will ensure free flow of water and help mitigate the problem of flooding. We, therefore, appeal to residents to shun throwing wastes into canals and drains, as this causes problems for the environment and people,” the statement said. It said most of the wastes cleared are recyclable materials and urged residents to recycle them, stressing that the act of sorting from source would encourage reduction of wastes at the landfill sites, improve the economy while serving as an empowerment for youths by engaging them in meaningful ventures. The statement added that residents would further be educated on the menace of plastic wastes, which posed danger to the environment. Residents hailed LAWMA for the timely intervention and suggested that the exercise should be a continuous one. They promised to support the government in its quest for a cleaner and healthier environment.
