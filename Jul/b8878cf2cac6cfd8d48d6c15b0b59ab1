Armed Police operatives on Saturday invaded the Lekki, Lagos residence of the Dakolo whose wife, Busola accused Fatoyinbo of rape. The operatives later delivered a letter of invitation to the couple for interrogation on Tuesday over alleged falsehood, mischief, conspiracy and theft to life. Reacting on his verified Instagram page, Dakolo took a swipe at Fatoyinbo, accusing him of using police to intimidate his family. He said: “We have long been ready for your intimidation and dirtiness. For your Ilorin methods and underhand tactics. A pastor? Bribing investigating officials to delay summons? “Paying dirty bloggers to fabricate things that cover the truth, going to the IG’s people under dark to force this case to be posted to Abuja? “Now this is an investigation in Abuja when you haven’t answered to the rape case against you in Lagos? Rubbishing the legal and criminal system? “And sending a bus load of armed policemen and shady men, lying in wait to intimidate my wife and children today, forcing their way into my home? “Is that how the real police deliver a letter? This is the best you can do? This is why all the hurting women and families haven’t come against you? “You picked the wrong one and you picked the wrong time. Nigerians are more awake than you think.” Declaring his readiness for battle, Dakolo stated: “If it is a fight you want, it’s a war you will get. Your filthiness under the guise of Christianity I will expose. “I will fight for my wife and children-it’s promise I made with my wife and one I intend to keep. I will defend them from the unrelenting attack of a weak man who thinks he can use money and power to cover for all of his crimes. Like I said, we have since been ready.”
