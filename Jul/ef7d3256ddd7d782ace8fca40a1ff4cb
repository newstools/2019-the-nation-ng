A leading governorship aspirant and founding member of the All Progressives (APC), Preye Aganaba, has made key appointments into his campaign council ahead of the partyâ€™s primary election for the November governorship poll in Bayelsa State. Aganaba in a statement signed by his Director Administration, Joseph Fafi, named a former acting Governor, Nestor Binabo, the Chairman of his campaign council. Fafi in the statement appointed a lawyer and former Commissioner for Capital City Development, Zuwa Konugha as the Director-General of the campaign organisation. He said the appointments were made in earnest preparation for the conduct of the forthcoming governorship primary election of the APC in the state. He said the appointments were based on the track record of the appointees, who had distinguished themselves in public service. Fafi said the campaign organisation expressed its unreserved confidence in their ability to lead the organisation to victory. He further expressed total confidence in the Adams Oshiomhole-led leadership of the party over the conduct of the party primary in Bayelsa state. He said Oshiomhole deserved a pat on the back over what he described as the bold initiative at restoring the values of party supremacy and discipline in APC. He enjoined the National Chairman to remain focus with the ongoing reform agenda and resist all forms of distractions. He also appeals to Bayelsans to embrace the generational shift in public service to take the state to the next level.
