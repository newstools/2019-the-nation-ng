President Muhammadu Buhari has been advised to avoid any pressure to appoint a former Oyo State governor as minister in his cabinet. The group, the Oyo State APC Reformers, comprising former political appointees across the 33 local governments of the state, including chairmen, commissioners, lawmakers and others, also counselled President Buhari against giving the ex-governor any sensitive position in the federal government. In a press statement jointly signed by its Acting Secretary, Mr. Sulaimon Ramon, and the Public Relations Officer, Engr Dipo Fawole, the group said: “90 per cent of the members of this body were elected and political appointees under the former governor and they have knowledge of how retrogressive, deceitful, anti-people  and self-centred the former governor was. “Returning him to power in any other capacity will be setting the party and the Federal Government against the interest of the people of Oyo State.” The group commended the security initiative of the South West governors and their request for the creation of state police.
