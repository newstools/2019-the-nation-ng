Lagos State Government will help in reducing the decline of wetlands and biodiversity conservation, the Ministry of the Environment has said. The problem was caused by indiscriminate destruction of natural wetlands for housing/industrial developments following increasing population and technological advancement. At a news briefing to herald the beginning of the “2019 Youth Outreach Ecotourism Programme on Wetland and Biodiversity Conservation”, for pupils in public secondary schools, the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Abiodun Bamgboye, said this was the only way to make the environment conducive for all. Fourteen pupils will participate in the eight-day programme. They will comprise two each from the six educational districts and two representing private and missionary schools. The pupils, who were chosen after screening, will traverse wetland locations and other conservation sites. Bamgboye said: “This year’s theme: ‘Our Biodiversity, Our Food, Our Health” is targeted to educate the public about human values towards a sustainable environment and bring about a situation in which people live in harmony with nature. “It is targeted at creating awareness on the diversity provided by the natural eco-systems for human existence and well-being on earth, while contributing to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, such as zero hunger, good health and well-being, no poverty as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystems restoration, cleaner water and among others.” Environmental Management Department Director Mr. Sheriff Savage, said the pupils would visit pristine and fragile ecosystems, zoological gardens and conservation centres across the five education divisions. “Through these visits, they will be acquainted with the abundant wetland resources and biodiversity of the state.”
