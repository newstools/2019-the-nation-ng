– WAEC does not charge extra for certificates A total of 4,795 more girls did better than boys in the 2019 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for school candidates released Friday by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC). This is despite more boys (822,098) sat for the examination than girls (768,075). Head of National Office (HNO), Olu Adenipekun, said at a press briefing to announce the results Friday at the Council’s Yaba Headquarters that a total of 64.12 per cent (1,020,519) of the 1,590,173 candidates that wrote the 2019 WASSCE made credits in five subjects, including English and Mathematics. While 50.23 per cent of this 1,020,519 were girls, 49.77 per cent were boys. Adenipekun, said: “One million and twenty thousand five hundred and nineteen (1,020,519) candidates representing 64.18 per cent obtained credits and above in minimum of five subjects including English Language and Mathematics. “of this number, 507,862 i.e. 49.77 percent were male candidates, and 512,657 I.e. 50.23 per cent were female candidates.” He added that the performance this year was better than last year’s, which was 50 per cent. Regarding examination malpractice, the HNO said 11.33 per cent (180,205) candidates have their results being withheld pending investigations into their involvement in fraud during the Examination. Responding to a question about school owners charging candidates before releasing their certificates, Adenipekun said the Council does not charge extra for WASSCE certificates outside the examination fees paid during registration. He said schools that charge extra for certificates did so for their own pockets. He said: “As far as WAEC is concerned, the certificate as well as the certificate cover being produced to help candidates preserve their certificates, we do not charge any extra money. Everything has been paid for when candidates made payment for the Examination before registration. So if there is any school charging candidates any other thing outside the Examination fee, then that is most unfortunate and it is not money meant for WAEC. If it is not meant for WAEC, then WAEC cannot be held responsible for it. I restate again to the nation, WAEC does not charge any separate fee for other things except the examination fee paid by candidates during registration.”
