Before now, the Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus and the party’s Vice Presidential candidate, Peter Obi had attended proceedings at different times. Dressed in brown French suit, Oshiomhole entered the court a little over 9 am, accompanied by former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu. He went straight to the court’s gallery, where he met and shook hand with those already seated, who are mostly chieftains of the PDP.
