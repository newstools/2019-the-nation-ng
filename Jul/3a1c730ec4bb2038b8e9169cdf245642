Deputy Senate Leader Ajayi Boroffice has called for  synergy among security agencies in their bid to combat crime. The senator spoke with reporters, shortly after visiting the Akure residence of Pa Reuben Fasoranti to commiserate with the nonagenarian over the killing of his daughter, Mrs Funke Olakunrin, by gunmen. He condemned the gruesome killing and expressed optimism that security agencies will fish out the killers within the shortest possible time. Borrofice said: “The growing spate of insecurity in the South West region and other parts of Nigeria is quite worrisome. However, the senator is aware security agencies are working hard to curb the unfortunate trend. It is also understandable that security agencies cannot announce all efforts to the public for security reasons. “Furthermore, all security agencies are urged to harmoniously work together towards finding sustainable solutions to insecurity issues in the South West and other parts of the Country. “On behalf of the Senate, I wish to identify with Pa Reuben Fasoranti and commiserate with the entire Fasoranti family over the murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin. May God grant the family the fortitude to bear this huge loss.”
