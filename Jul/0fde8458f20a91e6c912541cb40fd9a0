 Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Greg Etafia has returned to the pitch close to four years after quitting the game that brought him fame and fortune. The former Moroka Swallows of South Africa safehand has joined Highlands Park F.C. who have been battling goalkeepers shortage forcing a need to approach the Nigerian for succor. Highlands head coach Owen Da Gama in bid to remedy the situation asked the Nigerian to step in. “He has not conceded a goal in pre-season friendlies. He has been phenomenal and when (Tapuwa) Kapini went for an operation, we needed somebody and he was there and then we signed him,” said Da Gama. Etafia according to the club is not only stepping in as a remedy but is also expected to help boost the confidence of other goalkeepers. “Watch the space; he is there to push Kapini, Thela and Heugh Marlon. It might sound like a joke but he is incredibly doing well,” he added. Meanwhile, Da Gama believes newly-signed goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni can compete for a place in Bafana once he gets on top of his game. “Thela is not where he is supposed to be. We think Thela is not at his best but he is so much quality that in the next season he will one of the best goalkeepers in the league. He will challenge for Bafana because he is suddenly in an environment where he knows he can get better.” Highlands will flag off premier league campaign of 2019/2020 Professional Soccer league with a home clash against Visiting Kaizer Chiefs August 4th at the Makhulong Stadium.
