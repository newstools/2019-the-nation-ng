Ondo State Government on Monday observed with concern trending pictures of identity card carrying men identified as Fulani vigilante in the Akoko area of the state. Various claims reveal the activities, duties as well as supposed mandate of these men in question. A statement by the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo said; “It is pertinent to recall that at the height of the incessant kidnap cases, the Ondo State Government took some far-reaching drastic measure. “This included a marching order to the law abiding Hausa Fulani leadership in the area to fish out criminal elements among them who took advantage of the rosy relationship between the indigenes and their law-abiding guests. “As a measure to curb and possibly, stamp out cases of kidnap in the area, the Hausa Fulani leadership was directed to select a handful of trusted men amongst them who could serve as tour guards in the thick forest as security agencies prepared to comb the forests. This measure yielded results. “It is important to note however, that while Government appreciates the efforts of those who volunteered to provide information and served as tour guards to the security agencies in the ongoing operations in the area, it will not tolerate any unathorised move by any group to take an undue advantage of the current state of insecurity in the country. “Succinctly, Government, having been unaware of any such identity card carrying persons in the name of a vigilante group, has directed security agencies to get to the root of the matter and apprehend any such person or group of persons operating in that manner,” the statement stressed.
