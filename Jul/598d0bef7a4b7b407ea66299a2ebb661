South African fans and analysts alike have dubbed Eagles trio of Ahmed Musa, Odion Ighalo and Alex Iwobi as danger men, urging coach South Africa coach Stuart Baxter to ensure they are given close marking. The three players according to South Africans have shown in the course of the ongoing tournament in Egypt that they can do damage given the slightest opportunity. Musa is considered a threat because of his ability to create space on one hand and also drop deep to collect ball to flag off attack on the other. Odion Ighalo who has already scored three goals is tipped to aim for more goals and could be a handful for Bafana Bafana defensive duo of Thulani Hlatshwayo and Buhle Mkhwanazi whose job it will be to prevent him from wreaking havoc. Alex Iwobi they further noted has a blistering pace on a good day and that could be problematic for Bafana Bafana. Meanwhile former Bafana Bafana winger Daine Klate has believes the boys from the Rainbow City have all it takes to sing victory song but admitted that it will not come easy against Nigerian side that became more determined after that shocking defeat by debutants Madagascar in the group stage. “It’s been good to see the positive response around the Egypt win and I hope the guys can go on and do something special against Nigeria,” Klate enthused.
