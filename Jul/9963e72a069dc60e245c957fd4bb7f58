An author and poet, Michael Afenfia, has donated books to a private library, Prof. Azaiki Public Library in Yenagoa, the state capital. Afenfia, a former state Chairman of the Association of Nigeria Authors (ANA), handed the bags of assorted novels, including one he authored over to the library management. Presenting the books at the library, Afenfia said the gesture was aimed at promoting reading culture, which he said was on the decline among students in all levels of education in the country. The speech writer to Governor Seriake Dickson noted that the donation was to also complement the huge investments made by the Dickson-led Restoration Government in education. He also commended Prof. Steve Azaiki, owner of the library, for his contributions to education in Bayelsa State. He said: “This presentation is actually borne out of the decision of my wife and I to contribute to education development in Bayelsa State. We all know that, over the years, there has been a decline in reading culture and the standard of education across the country. “We felt that a move such as this can help to begin to bring that back in conjunction with whatever thing that the Bayelsa State government is doing to ensure that education is a front burner issue in this state.” Responding, Prof. Azaiki, represented by the Manager, Azaiki Foundation, Mr. Goodwin Fefegha thanked Mr. Afenfia for donating to the library. He said the donor had contributed immensely to the advancement of education in the country, even as he urged others to emulate him.
