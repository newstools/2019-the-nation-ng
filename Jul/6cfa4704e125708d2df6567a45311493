Four men, who allegedly stole N3.922, 799.82 from a hacked Ecobank account, were on Tuesday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. First to fourth defendants – Omotosho John Ifetayo, Adeboye Oluwatosin, Esagba Ovie Kayode, 27 and his brother Esagba Emmanuel Ayomikun, 22, – were arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining under false pretence and stealing. The Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (Force CIID) Annex, Alagbon-Ikoyi, said the defendants committed the offences on October 31, 2018. Police counsel Morufu Animashaun alleged that they conspired and stole N3, 922, 799, 82 from the bank’s offshore account through its Rapid Transfer Platform. The offences, according to him, contravened Sections 411, 314(1) and 280(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015, and punishable under Sections 314 and 287(5) of the same Law. Each defendant pleaded not guilty. Their counsel, Ige Asemudara, applied for their bail “on the most liberal terms.” He assured the court that the defendants were prepared for their trial and would never abscond. “The defendants were earlier granted administrative bail by the police and they never jumped bail,” he said. According to him, the defendants had no criminal record and this was the first time they would be charged with any offence. “As defence, we are undertaking that they shall attend trial. When we open the case, the court will find merit in our case,” Asemudara added. Animashaun did not oppose the application but prayed the court to apply its discretion. In a bench ruling, Magistrate M. O. Ope-Agbe granted each defendant N10million bail with one surety in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on September 16.
