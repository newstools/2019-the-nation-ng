As the remains of the slain Channels Reporter, Precious Ayoade Owolabi was committed to the mother earth at Wusasa Cemetery, Zaria, his mother has expressed shock over his death, saying her son said he was going to be famous. 21-years old Owolabi was killed last Monday in the crossfire between the protesting members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) and men of the Nigerian police. He was a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to serve with the Channels Television. Speaking to The Nation at their Zaria home before the burial on Thursday, Mrs. Owolabi said, her son was a well behaved, cultured and easy-going. According to her, “He loved his books. If you are looking to for him, just go to his room, you will meet him either reading or writing. “He use to tell us, he would become famous in life, but I never thought he meant to say, he would be famous in death.”
