Anthony Joshua insists he is more motivated than ever to win back his world heavyweight titles. The British boxer was knocked out in the seventh round by underdog Andy Ruiz Jnr at Madison Square Garden last month. But the 29-year-old has put the defeat behind him and is now ready to bounce back. “I’ve always said don’t let the failures get to your heart and don’t let the success get to your head, “ Joshua said on Instagram. “My legs and everything, it’s a weird feeling. As your climbing, the hole was getting deeper. “True failure isn’t quitting, I don’t think you should give up when you meet a blip in life. “I’m still keen to fight the best in the world. I’m still keen to prove myself and my ambition is to be two-time heavyweight champion of the world.” AJ’s representatives are still trying to organise a rematch with Ruiz. Two locations and dates have been suggested, one being November 29 back at Madison Square Garden, last month’s location, or December 14 at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. Joshua was knocked to the floor four times before losing to the Mexican outsider.
