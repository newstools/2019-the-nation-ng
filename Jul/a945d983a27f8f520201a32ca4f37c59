FOLLOWING the satisfactory post-privatisation performance of the Federal Superphosphate Fertilizer Company (FSFC) in Kaduna, theÂ  Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) on Thursday advised the firm to seek delisting from further monitoring. Speaking with reporters after the inspection of production and a tour on the plant in Kakuri, Kaduna, Director, Industries and Communication, Mallam Dikko Abdullahi, said after monitoring privatised enterprises for five years and getting a clean bill of health, the firm should be freed from further inspection and assessment once it is performing satisfactorily. He said since the FSFC has performed satisfactorily in terms of production and achievements after five years, it is advisable that the company applies for delisting and remain on its own.
