A teenage mother, simply known as Ummi, of Nassarawa Local Government Area of Kano State was on Saturday, arrested by the police for allegedly stabbing her 30-year-old brother, Sani Suleiman  to death following a dispute. Confirming the incident, the Kano State Police Command spokesman, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, said the Command, through its Badawa Divisional office, received a report at about 5:pm on Saturday that  Ummi had stabbed her elder brother on his neck. Kiyawa said it was learnt that Ummi, who had been engaged in a heated argument with her brother for two days, suddenly stabbed him on the neck, resulting to his death, shortly after he was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Kiyawa, said an argument ensued because the late Sani allegedly maltreated  his sister’s baby as eyewitnesses claimed that the cause of the tragic incident was the refusal of Sani to organize a traditional wedding party for two of his younger sisters. Ward Head of Unguwan Gaya Badawa, Alhaji Haliru Mohammed, expressed shock, over the tragic incident, adding the parents of the accused and the victim slumped when the sad news was broken to them and are receiving treatment at a nearby hospital, as at the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, the late Sani had been buried according to  Islamic rites. The PPRO said the Kano State Police Commissioner, Ahmed Iliyasu had ordered the transfer of the case from Badawa Division to the Criminal Investigation Department, at the Police Headquarters, Bompai, for further investigation.
