An Iyaganku Magistratesâ€™ Court, Ibadan, on Tuesday ordered that three men who allegedly beat a policeman to death, be remanded in prison, pending legal advice. The Magistrate, Mrs Mercy Amole-Ajimoti, ordered that Abubakar Mohammed, 25; Salisu Usman, 20; and Ajayi Ojo, 32, be remanded in Agodi prison. Amole-Ajimoti, who did not take the plea of the defendants, ordered the police to return the case file to the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). She, subsequently, adjourned the case until July 15, for mention. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp.
