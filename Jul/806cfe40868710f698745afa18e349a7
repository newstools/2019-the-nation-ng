A don, Prof. Yemi Akinloye, has advised youths to always allow God to be their foundation, adding that they should make Him the centre point of any decision they want to take. He was addressing the graduating pupils of Jextoban Secondary School, Lagos/Ibadan Expressway, Ibafo, Ogun State, during their 21st valedictory service and graduation of Class 2019. Akinloye said the foundation of many successful people is God. He urged the graduating pupils to put God first in whatever they want to do in life. The Chairman, Board of Governors, Pastor Emmanuel Ojo, enjoined parents to be friendly with their children in order for them to neutralise any negative influence as well as curb bad habits. Ojo, while congratulating the graduating set for having impressed the school “with your cool-headed disposition and readiness to submit to constituted authority, as well as take to correction,” said the day’s event marked the end of one chapter in their lives and the beginning of another. Speaking on the achievements of the school since it graduated its first set of 23 students in 1999; he said 1,297 pupils had so far completed their education on the Lagos campus. “On the Ibafo campus, 21 pupils have graduated, comprising five last year and 16 this year,” Ojo added.
