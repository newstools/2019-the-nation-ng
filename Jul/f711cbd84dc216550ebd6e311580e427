What could have been a major disaster for the creative advertising sector as well as the integrated marketing communication industry in Nigeria was averted when members of Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria, AAAN, escaped a near plane crash on their way to Asaba, the Delta state capital for the 46th AGM/Congress of the association scheduled to hold between Thursday and Saturday. The flight, operated by Air Peace Airlines, had on board over 40 members of the Association, including industry leaders and other stakeholders when it took off from Lagos on Thursday. Attempt to land the plane at the Asaba Airport proved abortive due to the weather and other logistic issues, compelling a return to Lagos. The airline subsequently cancelled flight operations to Asaba. Following this development, AAAN has postponed the AGM/congress to a yet-to-be announced date. In a press release received from the association, AAAN President, Ikechi Odigbo said, that line of action was necessary as available members in Asaba did not form a quorum for the AGM to hold. Lekan Fadolapo, Executive Director of AAAN disclosed that the board will meet soon to pick a new date. However, some advertising practitioners are of the opinion that the AGM is likely going to hold in Lagos before the end of July because the Business Session is constitutional and the constitution stipulate it holds in July. Delta State Governor, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa was expected to be the special guest of honour at the AGM while Jimi Awosika, Vice Chairman, Troyka Holdings is to speak alongside panelists which includes Steve Babaeko, Group CEO, X3M Ideas; Chizor Malize, CEO, Brandzone LLC and Igbo Amadi-Obi, CEO, BBDO on the theme “The war Within: Solutions for Survival.”
