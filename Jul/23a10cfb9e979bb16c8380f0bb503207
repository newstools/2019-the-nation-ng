The well attended event witnessed some personalities, including top management staff, parents, students and well-wishers among other guests. Rector of the institution, Victor Bassey, re-echoed the school’s blueprints such as high standards and core values towards driving the college to greatness. Bassey, an engineer, urged the new students to be above board and respect the school’s regulations. He added that the new intake were offered admission into the school’s 11 departments, including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Accountancy, Science Lab, Technology, Electrical/Electronics, Estate Management and Building Technology, Business Administration, Mass Communication and Public Administration, among others.
