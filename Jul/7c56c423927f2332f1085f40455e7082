Wema Bank, the creator of Africa’s first fully digital bank, ALAT, has launched a new online platform to provide seamless payment services to customers and merchants. The platform, named Outlet By ALAT, is primarily designed to connect shoppers with a range of digital services, including payments, event and movie ticket purchases, flight bookings, bet wallet funding, airtime vending, and utility bills. The platform is also a one-stop digital channel for listed merchants to receive payments for goods and services from both Wema Bank and non-Wema Bank account holders. Outlet By ALAT is an innovation designed to enable Nigerians who do not have an ALAT or Wema Bank account to enjoy some of the digital benefits the bank offers its customers. With Outlet By ALAT, customers can save time and improve productivity by cutting off long queues at the bank, electricity office, visa application offices, cinema foyers, among others. The platform is hosting the Big Brother Naija game, powered by Bet9ja. The prediction game offers fans of the reality TV show a chance to win exciting gifts when they show support for their favourite housemates. Shoppers and merchants can tap into the new innovation by registering on the website outlet.alat.ng to complete their transactions. Wema Bank, which recently unveiled award-winning singer, Teni the Entertainer, as its brand ambassador, is innovating to better serve customers and the  public.
