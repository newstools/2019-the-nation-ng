The incoming Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, has hailed leadership of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for the nine-month extension in oil production cut under the ‘’Declaration of Cooperation’’ which seeks to improve global oil market stability among OPEC members. Oil industry under the cooperation, OPEC member and non-member nations accelerated the stabilisation of global oil market through voluntary production adjustments which amounted to 1.8 million barrels per day. In a chat with newsmen in Vienna, venue of the 176th Meeting of OPEC, Mr. Bala Wunti, Group General Manager, Corporate Planning and Strategy representing Kyari, noted that pricing and volume of products remained key factors in ensuring sustainable revenue generation for the country. “Through the Declaration of Cooperation, greater stability is restored globally,  Nigeria believes that having the right price and volume can support our aspiration and ensure  a sustainable revenue generation’’ “We believe that continuation of the declaration is the way to go.  A Six-month extension is too short a time and will not have the required impact in curbing uncertainty and volatility which existed before the cooperation’’ “So a nine-month extension is the way to go considering the objective of the declaration, that is why Nigeria supports the initiative and is also  grateful that big nations are committed to it’’ According to him, that is the vision of the incoming NNPC boss, and that is the vision of Nigeria.
