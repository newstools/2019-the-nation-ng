After helping the country to win an unprecedented eight Africa Cup of Nations bronze medal, Super Eagles trio of Odion Ighalo, Jamilu Collins and Leon Balogun are the first set of players to depart the team’s camp in Egypt to their various clubs, AOIFootball.com can authoritatively confirm. Ighalo, who secured the bronze medal with a composed poke in just three minutes into the tie with Tunisia, will depart for China hoping that the injury he suffered would not be too serious to rule him out for a long period. The 30-year-old was already scheduled to return to Shenhua but pulled up a muscle during the closing stages of the first half of the third place game and would now go for further tests to determine the extent of the injury. Brighton defender Leon Balogun has also departed the team’s Le Meridien Cairo Airport Hotel. Similarly, Mikel will also fly back to England before heading to Turkey where he is expected to meet with his new employers after signing a deal during the AFCON with Trabzonspor. Left-back Jamilu Collins who remains a target of top European clubs also returned to Germany with the recently promoted Bundesliga side as the players begin to switch attention to the new European campaign.
