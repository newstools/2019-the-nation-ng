Dolphins in Ibadan on Tuesday as the first stage of the Zenith Bank Women
Basketball League comes to an end today. Both teams have won two games each against the Oyo and the Ogun

that the game would be very competitive as both team would battle to outwit one
another. She stated First Bank team knows the enormity of the task in
today’s game and were ready to win the game. “What is clear is that this game
will be a very competitive one considering the pedigree of both teams “We have trained hard in pre-season and the players have used
the first two games we played to form an understanding and hopefully we will
take that into the game against Dolphins. It will be a tough match but we are
ready to claim victory,” Adeniyi, a former player of the team stated. One of the team’s key players – Nkechi Akashili is currently not
with the team but Adeniyi said that the team would excel. “Nkechi has been a
key player in the team for several years and we are missing her but we will
play well to ensure that we emerge victorious. “Hopefully, she will overcome the issue that is keeping her out
of the game and join us soon. She calls to find out how we are doing and also
talk to the players to instill confidence in them,” she added.
