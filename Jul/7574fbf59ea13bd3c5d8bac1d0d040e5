Members of Kogi State Political Forum (Kano chapter) with membership spread across four states, alongside its Chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Haruna, on Monday endorsed Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello for second term. They said the governor deserves re-election in the November poll. During the forum’s inaugural ceremony in Kano for its newly elected executives to man the various positions for the next four years, Haruna emphasised the needs for continuity for even spread and completion of human-oriented projects. According to him, Bello has since commenced some of the projects he initiated and needs time to complete them, hence the need for continuity, which would afford him the opportunity for competition. ”It’s no longer a hidden fact that when some new governors are elected, on assumption of office, they would rather than complete the projects they inherited, initiate new ones and abandon the latter they inherited,” he stated. On its position in the forthcoming gubernatorial elections, the Chairman noted the forum will engage in advising the political actors to play the game by the rules, particularly to eschew political thuggery and other forms of violence that would not bring about credibility to the election. ”We will talk to politicians. to ensure that they sensitise their followers toward ensuring that there is a free and fair election. “We cannot say that we are in support of Yahaya Bello or not. It’s based on want the masses want that they would elect. So, we don’t have a choice, as the people have the mandate.
“The situation in Kogi is that everybody is coming out to contest and the person that the people want they would elect. “I look at it in a way whether the current Government is doing good or not, it all depends on how the people look at it and how they want it to be.”
