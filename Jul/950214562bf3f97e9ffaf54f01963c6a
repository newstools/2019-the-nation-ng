 President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) Hon.Daniel Igali, has called for assignment of sports portfolio to someone who will be a crusader for all sports and not a minister of football. He made the call following the submission of ministerial nominees to the National Assembly Tuesday, by the President. He opined that Nigeria would have indeed earned more fortune in sports over the years had she made deliberate effort to give other sports the same attention which football receives. Taking to the social media the 2000 Sydney Lightweight Gold medalist said “Now that the 43 wise men have been nominated, Mr. President, please assign the portfolio of sports minister to someone who will be a Crusader for all sports and not only for the one elite sport.  Someone who genuinely has passion for the upliftment of Nigerian sports “he said Igali who has continued to ginger a lot of wrestlers in the country to aspire to greater heights, has since becoming the President for NWF ensured that Wrestling championships hold periodically to according to him ensure that our athletes remain in top shape ahead of international meets. Igali only recently expressed optimism that Nigerian Wrestlers can garner as many as 10 Gold medals at the forthcoming 12th All-Africa Games in Rabat, Morocco. Nigeria won the wrestling event at the last All-Africa Games in Brazzaville, Congo four years ago claiming 19 medals 9 gold, 5 silver, and 5 bronze. Some sports fans in the country had in the past called for better attention for other sports noting that a lot of money has always been pumped into football related competitions while other athletes struggle to feature at international tournaments due to lack of funds.
