Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has asked the state’s contingent to the holy pilgrimage to pray for the progress of the state and for Nigeria. “I have come to see you off. I have come to bid you farewell to the Holy Land. Don’t forget Kwara when you get there. Don’t forget Nigeria. Pray for us. Pray for the progress of our state,” AbdulRazaq told the pilgrims in the early hours of yesterday as the state’s last batch was set to fly to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage. The governor prayed to God to accept the Hajj rites of the intending pilgrims, who he urged to be good ambassadors of the state. The head of the state’s contingent, Alhaji L’Azizi Jimoh, thanked AbdulRazaq for the visit which he described as the first of such by any governor of the state. “This is the first time a governor will come here to personally bid farewell to the pilgrims. We are grateful,” according to Jimoh, a renowned historian and community leader. A total of 2,026 persons are performing the holy pilgrimage from Kwara. Wednesday’s flight – involving 365 pilgrims – was the last from the state as the world prepares for the annual religious rites.
