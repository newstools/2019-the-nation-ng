To ensure that Lagos State remains safe, LASACO Assurance Plc has donated N10 million to Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF). LASACO Managing Director Mr Segun Balogun said the company iwas donating to the fund to help the organisation to continue providing the basic equipment to the security agencies in and around the state. He said the cash would go a long way to support to LSSTF  in its fight to ensure a crime-free state. Balogun pledged to be an ambassador of the LSSTF in the insurance industry, adding that there was the need for more organisations to support the fund. LSSTF Executive Secretary Dr. Abdurrazaq Balogun said it was becoming difficult for organisations to assist the fund. He stated that Lagos has about 9,400 roads that need to be secured. He said: “We believe that if we have just 1000 vehicles, that would be one vehicle to 900 roads; that is grossly insufficient. But if have 10,000 vehicles, it would be one to 90. The assets that we have are not enough but we will continue to manage the little that we have. “We urge other organisations that have not donated to the fund to make sacrifices for the security and prosperity that we all desire.’’
