Some gunmen on Monday evening abducted a woman identified as Foluke in Eruwa, the headquarters of Ibarapa East Local Government Area of Oyo state. It was gathered on Tuesday that Foluke and three of her colleagues, who were coming from Temidire Market, were accosted by the gunmen on the Old Ibadan-Eruwa Road around 6.30pm. The abduction of Foluke, a provision seller at Owode, according to a source, is coming less than two weeks after the abduction of a canteen owner, Mrs. Folakemi Olufunmilayo in Igbo-Ora, in the same local government area. A source said the gunmen, numbering about four, accosted Foluke, who drove the car and the three other passengers, seized their mobile phones, parked the car on the road and whisked her away. He said the abductors released the three passengers after collecting their phones. The source said: “I can tell you that another woman, Foluke has been kidnapped in Eruwa on Monday. Foluke and three other people were coming from Temidire Market when she was abducted around 6.30pm. The market is in Eruwa. There are four people in the car. She was the one that drove the car. “Out of the four persons, she is the only one that they kidnapped because she was the one that drove the car. They seized their phones so that they will not contact anybody until they get to the town. They took her away and left the car at the spot. “I know her; she sells provision at Owode in Aborerin. The case has been reported at Eruwa Divisional Headquarters. I learnt that the vigilante group and the hunters have been hunting for them.” Police spokesman Olugbenga Fadeyi said officers have been hunting for the abductors to ensure the release of the victim. Fadeyi said: “Yes, it is true. It was a case of abduction. The command is working to get the detail of the incident. The command is seriously working hard to get the abductors. The command is aware of the incident and working hard to ensure release of the victim.”
