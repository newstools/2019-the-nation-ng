SENATOR Solomon Adeola popularly known as Yayi on Thursday appealed to the National Emergency Management Agency, (NEMA) and Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to urgently mobilise to Ijegun to assist victims of the pipeline fire. In a statement by his media aide, Kayode Odunaro, Adeola said: “It is quite unfortunate that this kind of explosion is now a recurring decimal in my Senatorial district with regrettable loss of lives and millions of naira in private property without any compensation for victims. “The last time was about a year ago in Alagbado area with massive loss of property. “As a temporary measure, I call on NEMA to send relief materials for residents of the area now displaced and suffering from the trauma of early hours of the day explosion and conflagration. ” The senator asked the NNPC, Petroleum Products Marketing Company, (PPMC) and owners of private tank farms in the area to work out modern methods of securing and monitoring their facilities, particularly the several kilometres of pipelines which are susceptible to vandalism. “In the interim, NNPC should reconsider the use of local security/ vigilantes and communities to monitor and secure pipelines from sabotage by vandals,” he said.
