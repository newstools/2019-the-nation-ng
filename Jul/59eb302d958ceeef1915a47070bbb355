President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday submitted the list of his ministerial nominees to the Senate. The list of 43 nominees was read by senate president Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the Senate immediately after a closed session held by the lawmakers. Diverse reactions have, however, trailed the list.
Here are some reactions of Nigerians on social media: I pray and hope that after senate clear them , they help Mr. President in stabilizing the nation to put an end to all this killing here and there #MinisterialList — Jibril Ten Ten (@Ozegya) July 23, 2019  Nigeria needs "young cold blood" to overhaul her OLD & INEFFECTIVE system.
