President Muhammadu Buhari has extended heartfelt condolences to the family, the government and people of Nasarawa State on the death of Vice Admiral Husaini Abdullahi (Rtd). Buhari, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, also commiserated with the military authorities on the passing of the former governor of Bendel State from March 1976 to July 1978. The President affirmed that Vice Admiral Abdullahiâ€™s life was defined by dedicated service to the nation and others, exemplified by his brilliant career in the military and numerous works in the private sector that resulted in the provision of gainful employment to many Nigerians. He prayed Almighty Allah to grant the soul of the departed eternal rest and comfort all who mourn.
