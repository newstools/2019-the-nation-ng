Leaders of Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) yesterday directed workers to withdraw their services, shut ports operations and begin a nationwide strike from today over unpaid wages to dockworkers, among other issues. Addressing officials  and a cross section of dockworkers at the Dockworkers’ branch of MWUN, Lagos, they threatened that the industrial action would not be suspended until all outstanding payments for over a year were fully paid among other issues resolved Recall that MWUN had on June 11, given the Federal Government 14 day ultimatum to compel International Oil Companies, (IOCs), to pay over a year outstanding wages to dockworkers, among other issues or face nationwide industrial unrest. Last week, the leaders of the union set up a strike coordinating committee and directed its officials in all port formations nationwide to begin a massive mobilisation of members ahead of the planned strike. Explaining why the union had resorted to industrial action, President-General of the union, Adewale Adeyanju, said the non-payment of government appointed stevedores/dockworkers by the IOCs contravened Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Act 2007. He lamented that several efforts made for the IOCs to see reason including the stakeholders meeting organised by the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA), fell through, lamenting that  while some of the affected dockworkers had passed on prematurely due to economic hardship, those alive had become destitute. He said: “As a responsible union, we cannot continue to fold our arms and watch our members die prematurely  because of the nonchalant attitude of the IOCs management toward the welfare of our members. In view of the foregoing, we gave a 14-day ultimatum/notice to the Federal Government, through the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation to prevail on the IOCs to do the needful by paying our members. Ahead of the expiration of 14 days ultimatum/ notice, which elapsed on Friday,June 28, 2019, we issued a reminder letter dated June 27,2019, informing the government that if at the close of work on Tuesday July 2,2019, (today) no evidence of payment is seen, our members shall withdraw service in all the nation’s seaports until all issues in contention are resolved.
