The Independent National Commission (INEC) has fixed Aug. 3 for the conduct of a bye-election for Pengana State Constituency in Plateau. The commission’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Friday. He said that the commission approved the conduct of the election at its meeting on Friday. Okoye said that the Speaker of Plateau House of Assembly, Mr Abok Ayuba, had in a letter dated June 20, notified the commission of a vacancy in the Assembly following the demise of a member-elect, Mr Ezekiel Afon. The letter stated that Afon died after he was declared winner of the March 9 House of Assembly Election in the constituency. “Consequently, the commission met today, July 5 and approved the conduct of bye-election to the said constituency which will take place on Aug. 3. “Political parties shall conduct their primaries on or before July 10 and submit the list of nominated candidates on or before July 12,” Okoye said, adding that campaigns would end on Aug. 1. He urged all interested political parties and their candidates to cooperate with INEC to ensure a free and fair election.
