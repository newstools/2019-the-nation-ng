Barring last-minute changes, global ride sharing giant, Uber, will launch operations in Benin City in July, further swelling the ranks of global ride sharing companies operating in the city. This comes after weeks of engagements between government and Uber officials and finalising modalities for the smooth takeoff of the service in Benin city. The Edo State Skills Development Agency (EdoJobs) is already leading the charge with the recruitment of riders on the platform. Senior Special Assistant to the State Governor on Skills Development and Jobs Creation and Head, EdoJobs, Mrs. Ukinebo Dare, said that the launch would take place at the Edo Innovation Hub, and  Governor Godwin Obaseki is expected to grace the occasion. According to her, “We are working with Uber to finalise modalities for the takeoff of the service in Benin City. We are excited because this helps in getting people meaningfully engaged. As you know, Uber gives car owners the opportunity to make some money with their cars. But we are keen on the job-creating feature of the service as well.” She said the launch takes place on July 24, and would host a number of dignitaries within the state and beyond, noting, “We expect to have a full house. Early in the day, we will have a chat with journalists and afterwards, the governor takes the zero ride. That would mark the start of the service in Benin City.” She added that the state government is collaborating with Uber to also recruit drivers through its expansive database, calling on people interested in the service to sign up to enjoy its immense benefits. Recall that Taxify launched in the state late last year, and has recorded impressive rating from residents. Uber is expected to deploy its unique selling point to fight for its stake in the market as well.
