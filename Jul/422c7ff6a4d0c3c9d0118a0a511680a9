AN American based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Adaigbo Women in Diaspora, has promised  to intervene in the feeding of over 63 primary schools in Anambra State. President of the group, Mrs Eunice Onwunyi, stated this on Friday at Trinitas Nursery and Primary School, Nri, Anaocha Local Government Area of the state. She said the intervention was part of the community development effort of the Diaspora women of Igboland. Onwunyi represented by Mrs. Nkiru Udeorji, said the distribution of the food rich in protein and vitamins as well as drinks would cover primary schools in the zone. She said, “This programme is to complement the efforts of the federal government for healthy growth of school children in the country. “Three primary schools from private and public sectors which were most disadvantaged would be selected from each of the 21 council areas of Anambra to benefit from the feeding intervention.” Lamenting the dilapidated state of Trinitas Nursery and Primary School, Onwunyi assured that the group would provide the basic needs to the school in no distant time. “We shall help to improve the school’s learning environment by making it part of our programme implementation chart,” she added. The proprietress of the school, Mrs. Roseline Jideobi, was full of gratitude to the group for choosing her school as one of the beneficiaries of the exercise. Acknowledging that the school was in dire need of help, Jideobi said the school had never had such gesture, expressing hope of positive effect on the pupils. “We shall equally appreciate sending us children’s books and sport gears to complement the expected good and healthy life of the pupils,” she said. The NGO’s cardinal community development programme includes medicare and educational supplies.
