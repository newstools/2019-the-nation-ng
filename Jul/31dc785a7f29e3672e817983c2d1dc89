Ekiti State Government has said it will promote and market young and upcoming talented youths as a way of promoting the rich culture of Ekiti people. The Director General Council of Arts and Culture, Ambassador Wale Ojo Lanre, gave the hint at a forum in Ado-Ekiti where a young talented professional konga drummer, Mr. Oluwatayo Oluwadamilare performed to the admiration of the audience. Describing Oluwadamilare as the best konga (a special African drum) drummer in Nigeria, the Director General noted that the council would extend an invitation to him at the forthcoming Ekiti State Festival of Arts and Culture which is slated for December this year where the artist is expected to demonstrate his God given talent as a way of showcasing the rich culture of Ekiti people. Responding, Mr. Oluwadamilare said he was prepared to impact the world with his talent, saying he believes so much in the potential and talents that abound in Ekiti which were only waiting to be harnessed.
