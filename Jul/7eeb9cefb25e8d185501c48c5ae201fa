The hostilities between the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole and Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, seemed to have come to an end on Wednesday. The duo met at the Presidential Policy Retreat at the Council chamber of the State House, Abuja. Before the retreat started, they were asked by some photojournalists in the council chamber to shake hands and pose for snapshots. The two of them complied and posed for the photograph with the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi. Fayemi replied the photojournalists with “We are not quarreling here” Obaseki and Oshiomhole had been at loggerhead over the timing and manner of the proclamation of the Edo State House of Assembly.
