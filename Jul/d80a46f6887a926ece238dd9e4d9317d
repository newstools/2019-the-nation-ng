The Community Based Care and Support Programme (CBCSP), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) of Catholic Diocese of Lafia, said it is sponsoring the education of 505 vulnerable children in Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. CBCSP Programme Manager Emmanuel Madaki, made this known yesterday while speaking with newsmen in Obi. Madaki said the organisation decided to provide the scholarship based on the humanitarian ground in order to give the children a sense of belonging and due to the importance of education in the society. According to him, CBSP started operations on March 28, 2003, as a social arm of the diocese. “And since then we have been embarking on different intervention programmes in the areas of health, education and household economic strengthening, among others, for societal development. “We have embarked on different humanitarian gestures such as empowerment of about 400 vulnerable women and caregivers with N10,000 each in this local government alone to improve economic power. “We are sponsoring the education of 505 vulnerable children in Secondary and Primary schools in this area. “Out of this number, 263 are female while 242 are males and this gesture is to make them better future leaders,’’ he said. Madaki noted that the importance of education cannot be over-emphasised to the socio-economic development of the society, hence the need for the organisation’s gesture in that direction.
