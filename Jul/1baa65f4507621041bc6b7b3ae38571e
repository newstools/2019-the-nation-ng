One of Big Brother Naija 2019 housemates, Simply Tacha on Monday, stated that she is strongest in the house. While reacting to her nomination for eviction this week during her diary session, Tacha said: “I am the strongest in the House and I am a target that’s why I was nominated by housemates.” Tacha was nominated for eviction, alongside Ella, Mercy, KimOprah and Sir Dee which means any one of them could go home on Sunday. Recall that Isilomo and Avala were on Sunday evicted from the show.
