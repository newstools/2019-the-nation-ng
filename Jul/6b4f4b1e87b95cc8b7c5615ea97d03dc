A medical consultant with the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Dr Inyama Marcus, who was kidnapped on July 18 2019 in Akpabuyo local government area of Cross River has regained freedom. Permanent Secretary on Security, Dr Alfred Mboto, told reporters in Calabar on Friday evening said Marcus was released through the combined efforts of the state government and security agencies in the state. “Dr Marcus has been released. As we speak, they are on their way from where he was released to town”, he said. Chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) in the state, Dr Agam Ayuk, said,
“What I can only say is that the report reaching us from the office of the Permanent Secretary on Security is that Dr Marcus has been extracted from the hands of the kidnappers. “He is still with the security agencies for now. We hope that he will be re-united with his family soon,” he said. Ayuk said that he was not aware of any money paid for his release. “More details will come later and we are going to meet as an Association and take a decision on the next thing to do,” he said. It would be recalled that the NMA had withdrawn their services from all hospital across the state when Marcus, a consultant haematologist, was abducted, saying they would only resume work when he is released safely and unconditionally.
