Four children including twin girls and a landlord were on Sunday night injured after a building partially collapsed in Bariga, Lagos Mainland. The incident occurred around 9:30pm at 30, Ososa Street. It was gathered that the building had been distressed with crack lines evident on parts of it for a while.
Those injured, it was learnt included the twin girls Kehinde and Taye, their brother Idowu, another unnamed kid and the landlord identified as Pa Ayilara. According to the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), all injured persons were moved to the hospital same night for treatment and the partially collapsed two-storey building cordoned off. Spokesman for the agency Kehinde Adebayo said in a statement that all residents were evacuated before the premises were sealed, adding that the landlord who initially refused to be moved out, was eventually taken to Gbagada General Hospital. “The Director General LASEMA Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu advised the owner of the structure to ensure holistic assessment is carried out by Lagos State Building Control Agency (LABSCA) before any repairs,” he said.
