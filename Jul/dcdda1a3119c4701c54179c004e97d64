Reigning Paralympic champion, Nigeria’s Bose Omolayo delivered an explosive performance as she broke the world record en route to taking the women’s up to 79kg gold on Day 5 of the ongoing Nur-Sultan 2019 World Para Powerlifting Championships in Kazakhstan, SportingLife reports. Defending world champion and world record holder Xu Lili was on paper the strongest candidate for gold. However, the Nigerian successfully pushed a world record-breaking 142kg lift in her third attempt to claim her first Worlds title. The Chinese finished in second after clearing the bar at ‘just’ 128kg. Indonesia’s Siti Mahmudah (118kg) sealed bronze. “It wasn’t an easy competition. I was aiming to challenge Lili and the world title. So, once she failed in her second and then third round, I chose to go for word record. And it was all possible because of my faith in God and his miracles,” 41-year-old Omolayo said. Also, 2018 Fazza World Cup record holder, Folashade Oluwafemiayo emerged the strongest pushing 150kg to supass China’s Zheng Feifei and keep the world record and the gold medal to herself in the women’s up to 86kg.
