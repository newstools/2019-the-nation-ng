The Felix King Foundation, run by veteran singer, Felix King of Felix and Mozys fame, has provided an opportunity for additional widows in Afuda community in Edo State to be part of the Foundation’s Widows Market Moni initiative. The foundation launched the scheme last month in seven communities in Esan Central Local Government Areas, where each group was given a trade support grant of up to 500,000 Naira. The first communities that benefited from the programme were Udowo group, Ugbokhare group, Afeda group, Ibhiolulu group, Eidenu group, Eguare group and Ewu group. According to the singer, the Widows Market Moni is a grant for rural widows with young kids and elderly widows without children to take care of them. Widows are encouraged to form themselves into groups, just like the traditional village women meeting group. The groups are thereafter upgraded into co-operatives. Speaking after the 20 additional widows were presented with grant, the founder/president of Felix King Foundation, Dr. Felix King said that the need to educate and empower our girls and women can never be more critical than now. “TheWidows Market Moni is helping our widows send their children to school so that they are able to seize the opportunity the future provides without limitations,” he said. “As a female centric foundation, we have over the years empowered thousands of widows  through business start-ups and farming support grants, in Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, Kaduna, Ibadan and Edo.” Dr. King revealed that the foundation’s target is to reach out to one thousand (1000) widows in fifty (50) communities before the end of the year. “Our target before the end of 2019 is to reach 1000 additional widows in 50 communities in Edo State. This in addition to the rural women cooperative schemes that would be launched in September 2019 in Edo State as pilot, which is an all-inclusive scheme for rural women.”
