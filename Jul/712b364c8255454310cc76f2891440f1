According to the Chief Executive Officer of Fojo Media Productions and Executive Producer of the movie, Mrs. Faith Ojo, ‘The Reunion’ shares the struggles of women while living up to the expectations of the society. Commenting on the Nigerian film industry, Mrs. Ojo said that Nollywood actors are a match to Hollywood actors any day, adding that the support and partnership they give to every project they are involved in makes the difference. “The Nollywood industry will be bigger than what it is today if Nollywood actors throw their weight and support from their fans to make each movie a hit,” she said. “That way, the producer makes more money to plunge back into paying them for more movies. “The industry has a lot of prospects and until actors see each project as their personal project, then we may remain where we are.” Mrs. Ojo stressed that the government cannot be looked on for the development of every sphere of the society, hence her role in ensuring that more upcoming talented young people in the movie industry grow. The producer and director of the movie, Thomas Odia, praised the cast and crew. “It is high time crew members got recognised for exceptional creativity, dedication to the job and hard work,” she said.
