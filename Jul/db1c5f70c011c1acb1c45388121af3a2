The governorship election petition tribunal sitting in Kano on Tuesday vacated the application of Abba Kabiru Yusuf of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to amend its witness list and oath of statement. The PDP governorship candidates in Kano had filed motion before the tribunal to correct errors in the list of witness, to enable them include eight additional star witnesses on their list. Although, the lead counsel to PDP governorship candidate, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo SAN told the court that the intent of the motion was not to amend the original petition, counsels to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents unanimously opposed the application. In her ruling, Justice Halima S. Mohammad insisted PDP’s application stands rejected considering the timing and content. Justice Mohammad who cited relevant references on electoral act and judgements of competent jurisdiction, maintained that PDP has exhausted the 21 days privilege within which petitioner could add or amend it list. The PDP governorship candidate Abba is challenging Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s victory in the last general election in Kano.
