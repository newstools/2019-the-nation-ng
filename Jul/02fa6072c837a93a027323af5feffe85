The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) on Monday resumed the trail of 14 medical doctors charged with misconduct. In its first case the MDCN Tribunal, convicted one Doctor, Godwin Maduakor for gross negligence. According to the Tribunal, Maduakor was guilty of the count charges brought against him and was therefore suspended. Chairman of the Tribunal, Prof. Abba Waziri Hassan who reads the judgment said Dr. Maduakor is suspended for six months for count one and three months for count two. The convictions run concurrently, he said. Maduakor is part of the nine Asaba medical doctors who are standing trial for alleged professional misconduct. The other Doctors still standing trial from the Asaba Medical Centre, Delta state are Sunday Abiodun Ogafe Ojenuwah, Oyefara Babatunde, Okoye Pascal Nnamdi, Anunnobi Chijioke Ralu, Adigba Ese Onodjohwoyovwe, Ogwu Robinson Onyekachukwu, Okoye Chukwuka and Iyiola Akeem Adewale. The charge against one of the nine was however withdrawn. They are to defend themselves on charges of grouse conduct of negligence in the management of a pregnant patient, Mrs. Rita Uche Ogbuego. They all pleaded not guilty when the case charge was read to them individually. At the last sitting two other doctors were convicted with their license suspended for the maximum penalty of six months. The MDCN is the regulatory body of all medical and alternative medicine practitioners in the country, with mandate to discipline any erring practitioners whose actions or in-actions fall short of the medical professional ethics. The MDCN Tribunal has equal jurisdictions with the regular High Court, hence its ruling can only be challenged at the Court of Appeal.
