OVER 200 Nestlé Nigeria volunteers have reached out to 18 orphanages and Non Governmental Organisations working with children across the country. This is done under the company’s Nestlé Cares initiative, an employee-volunteering programme, which provides a platform for employees to give back to the society by donating their time and talents to make a positive impact on individuals and families, communities and the environment. The orphanage outreach is the second Nestlé Cares activity after the beach clean-up exercise carried out by Nestlé volunteers in June 2019. Speaking on the orphanage outreach, Nestlé Nigeria’s Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Mrs Victoria Uwadoka, said this is part of Nestlé’s efforts to support parents and caregivers on their journey to raise healthier kids through the Nestlé for healthier kids, global flagship initiative. She explained that Nestlé for Healthier Kids aims to help 50 million children globally, lead healthier lives by 2030, and will achieve its objectives by promoting good nutrition, encouraging active lifestyles through adequate physical activity, teaching good hygiene practices and healthy hydration. Commenting during the visit to SOS Children’s Villages in Isolo, Lagos, Mr. Gboyega Fadowole-Aje, national fund development and communication coordinator, said the home was delighted to the care volunteers. “We are excited to have hosted kindhearted friends like Nestlé Nigeria Plc, who through their gifts and commitment today show their support. SOS Children’s Villages continues to be the world’s largest international non-governmental organisation focused on supporting children who have lost or are at risk of losing parental care.
