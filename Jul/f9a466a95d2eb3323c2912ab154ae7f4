An FCT High Court on Wednesday ordered that two men, who allegedly posed as a woman and defrauded an American, be remanded in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), until July 29, pending sentencing. The EFCC charged Augustine Odili and Olumide Agbi, with cheating by inducement. Justice Mohammed Idris gave the order, following a guilty plea entered by the defendants. The EFCC counsel, Mr Sunday Robert, told the court that Odili committed the offence between 2018 to March 2019. Robert said Odili assumed the name of Mary Palmer an investor, deceived and collected 900 dollars from Mr Jagaduish Nasidu, an American. He further alleged that the defendant pretended to be Fabio Branco and through a gmail account and defrauded Ms Judy Brandt of a sum equivalent to N5 million . Robert also informed the court that the defendant swindled Ms Doris Heun, an American of 500 dollars, in a love scam. He said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 320 (b) of Penal Code punishable under Section 322 of the same Code. Robert urged the court to convict and sentence the defendant based on the plea bargain they signed with the anti- graft agency after his guilty plea. The defendantsâ€™ counsel, Mr Abel Adaji , prayed the court for leniency in sentencing them.
