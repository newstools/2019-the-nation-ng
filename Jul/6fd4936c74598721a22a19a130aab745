Chika Nwaogu, a Nigerian computer programmer and founder of LAGbook, has created the very first indigenous music streaming platform called “Playfre” with over 45 million songs for Africans. Playfre, pronounced ‘play free’, allows music lovers to access millions of songs for free. Nwaogu noted that Playfre was created to counter to the unavailability of Spotify and other global music streaming platforms to most African countries because of the weak intellectual property laws existing in these parts of the world. On the uniqueness of the app, Nwaogu explained that big music streaming platform charge to stream unlimited music which is not fair to Nigerians. The app enables users to listen to any music on Playfre even while not on the app as opposed to the web player. “We have been developing what will become Africa’s first real answer to Spotify,” Nwaogu said. “We at Playfre are trying to bring the over 45 million songs on Spotify to you at no charge, with the same Spotify experience and guess what? We did it!.” Officially launched on May 1, 2019, Playfre, is available for free download on Google’s Playstore. Nwaogu also said that Playfre will be rolling out ‘Playfre for Artist’ service, a service that let musicians get their songs on the platform for free.
