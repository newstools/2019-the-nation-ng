Leicester City have signed striker Ayoze Perez from Newcastle United on a four-year contract, the Premier League club said on Thursday. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed but British media reported that Leicester would pay Newcastle 30 million pounds for the 25-year-old Spaniard. Perez, who joined Newcastle from his hometown club Tenerife in 2014, was the Premier League club’s top scorer last season with 12 league goals. “Leicester City Football Club is delighted to confirm the signing of Spanish forward Ayoze Perez for an undisclosed fee, subject to Premier League and international clearance,” Leicester said in a statement on their website. “Perez is one of the Premier League’s most exciting talents, with pace, trickery and an eye for goal that will add plenty to City’s attacking ranks ahead of their top-flight opener at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday August 11.” The forward is Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers’ second signing of the close season following the arrival of defender James Justin from Luton Town.
