Nollywood actress Lota Chukwu Elixir, popular in the series ‘Jenifa’s Diary’ as Kiki is of the opinion that ‘Consent’ needs to be taught in Nigerian secondary schools. “Consent needs to be taught in schools, secondary schools,” she said. “Our generation was raised by ignoring deep issues and went ahead to pampage just like generations before us, deliberately or unintentionally (hurts just as much). “To change that, we need to protect our future generations and the only way to do that is to teach our younger generation to do better. We can’t change all of the past generations but millennials can start to make a change by teaching the next generation to do better.” “When it comes to consent, a lot of us had to learn the true meaning by ourselves. Consent isn’t “if he doesn’t say ‘no’ you can continue”; it isn’t “if she invites me to her bedroom that means she’s ready”. A lot of our elders could only teach us as much as they knew and understood, if we know better, let’s not fail the next generation. Welcome to my Ted Talk.” In 2017, the actress who is also a yoga fitness enthusiast announced the take-off of “Lota Takes”, a cooking and lifestyle show which shows Lota in her elements as a food and nature lover. The show has featured several Nigerian celebrities including Adekunle Gold, Tosin Ajibade, Aramide and MC Galaxy among others.
