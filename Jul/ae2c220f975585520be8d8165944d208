The Senate will on Monday resume confirmation hearing to screen 12 remaining ministerial nominees forwarded to it by President Muhammadu Buhari for confirmation as ministers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Upper Chamber had already screened 31 out of the 43 nominees referred to it for confirmation by Buhari. While it screened ten nominees on Wednesday July 24, 14 others were screened last Thursday. The Senate suspended its rules to sit on Friday 26, 2019 when seven nominees were screened. Those remaining to be screened are former Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola (Osun); former Information Minister Lai Mohammed (Kwara); former Lagos Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola; Dr. Muhammad Mahmoud (Kaduna); Engr. Sabo Nanono (Kano) and Engr. Saleh Mamman (Taraba). Others are Senator Gbemisola Saraki, who is likely to be asked to take a bow and go (Kwara); Goddy Jedy-Agba (Cross River); Engr. Sulaiman H. Adamu (Jigawa); Amb. Maryam Katagum (Bauchi); Clement IK Anade Agba(Edo) and Geoffrey Onyeama (Enugu). Onyeama is the immediate past Foreign Affairs Minister. Of the remaining nominees, fire works is expected between the Senate and Lai Mohammed due to his sensitive portfolio between 2015 and 2019. Mohammed as the Information Minister, was the image maker of Buhari Presidency during the period. Tough grilling by the senators is also expected to be handed Fashola due to the sensitive nature of the three ministries he superintended over as minister from 2015-2019. Fashola is the immediate past Minister of Power, Works and Housing, a position, it is being speculated he might be re-appointed to if he is confirmed by the Senate. In all, it is expected that the confirmation hearing may be concluded on Tuesday and the ministers- designate inaugurated on Wednesday for the government to hit the ground running.
