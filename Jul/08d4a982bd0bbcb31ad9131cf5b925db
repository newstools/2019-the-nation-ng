The renomination and screening of the immediate past Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, by President Muhammadu Buhari, have been described as recognition of the former governor of Rivers State’s hard work, commitment and doggedness to the success of Buhari’s administration. The Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, stated this on Friday at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, Rivers State, in an interactive session with reporters. He hailed the Senate for the successful screening of Amaechi, a two-term Speaker of Rivers House of Assembly. He said: “Rt. Hon. Amaechi proved his mettle as an administrator of men, materials and resources during his tenure as transportation minister. His renomination by the President is a vote of confidence in him and also a mark of honour. He performed impressively in the railway, maritime and port sectors of the economy. “Under Amaechi’s watch, Nigeria witnessed tremendous leaps in the reforms carried out in NIMASA, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), other maritime agencies and railway sectors, which have produced outstanding results to the benefit of Nigerians. He is a reform-minded and visionary leader who approaches his work with the highest degree of passion and commitment. “Rt. Hon. Amaechi will always bring his wealth of experience to bear and create indelible marks in every national assignment, as he has done in all the offices he has held.” The 2015 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State also stated that the Senate in screening the former Rivers governor, without much ado, deepened the National Assembly’s nod for performing public servants.
