Nigerian Basketball Federation (NBBF) President, Ahmadu Musa Kida has hailed sponsors and supporters of the Women’s Basketball League, Zenith Bank Plc for their long-term sponsorship and partnership, saying ‘I am proud and impressed.’ Kida, during an interview, spoke about his impression towards the Women’s Basketball League and how Zenith bank has continued to increase the growth of the sport in the country. “In a general sense I would say that basketball is very visible and has had very huge impact on the world front or globally I would say and also here locally, the continued sponsorship of Zenith for the women, we have continued to make very great strides in terms of the development of the women’s league but also on the African continent and for the world cup last year,” he said. “I think what is very instructive is the coverage domestically and that is important, meaning that for the first time, we are seeing about 27 teams participating in the women’s league we haven’t seen that participation before in the country, for the first time it is really a format of a league (home and away games) and also that the media are giving a large coverage. For us, we think we are quite pleased with the progress that has been made in the women’s front “Two years ago I had told you that we are starting from basically ground zero that we were going to put everything flat and then build up from there, so two years after that I am quite proud and impressed,” he added. Kida also stated that without the sponsorship from the bank, the women team wouldn’t have achieved such great heights in Africa and the world at large. The tournament will tee off tomorrow and will feature 27 teams.
