A woman, Laura Inmanze, who allegedly defrauded a Bureau de Change operator, Nura Mustapha, of N4.2 million, was on Wednesday brought before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Inmanze, 24, was arraigned by the police before Mrs A. M. Olumide-Fusika on a two-count charge of obtaining money under false pretences and theft. Prosecuting Inspector Ben Ekundayo alleged that the defendant committed the offences at about 2:30pm on June 21, at 7, Kalama Street, Lagos Island. Ekundayo said the defendant and her husband, Tony (who is at large), obtained £9,000 Pounds from Nura Mustapha, a Bureau de Change operator, with the pretext of sending him the naira equivalent of N4.` million. “Tony, a client of Mustapha, called him to send £9,000, that he had sent the naira equivalent to his wife’s account, who was on her way to Lagos from Owerri. “Mustapha called the defendant to know if N4.2 million was truly sent to her account and she confirmed that her husband sent the money to her, so Mustapha forwarded the money to Tony’s account based on self-recognition. “When the defendant arrived in Lagos and was asked for the money, she started giving excuses, tried to escape and was arrested,” he said. According to Ekundayo, offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate, Mrs Olumide-Fusika granted the defendant N1 million bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on August 7.
