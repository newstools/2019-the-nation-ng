Oil tumbled yesterday as the non-members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) deal failed to excite investors. Oil prices were still buoyant yesterday as benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $65.22 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at $59.12. Crude had risen more than one percent in Monday’s session on OPEC’s decision but has since pared gains. Markets experienced a more muted reaction given that a supply cut had already been flagged by the likes of Saudi Arabia at last weekend’s Group of Twenty (G-20) meeting in Japan, taking out what Sen described as the “surprise element” for the market. Concerns over the demand outlook amid uncertainty over global trade relations, and how those are impacting the international growth outlook, were seen as weighing on sentiment. Nonetheless, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister struck an optimistic tone on the demand for oil, despite weaker global economic conditions. Saudi oil minister: We’re seeing ‘good demand’ for oil amid trade war “I think we’ve seen good demand numbers and we’ve seen the U.S. pickup,” Khalid al-Falih told reporters at the OPEC meeting in Vienna on Monday. “I think there have been things like weather-related issues, some of the industrial activity has pulled back temporarily as a result of the trade dispute between China and the U.S. I’m optimistic that there is a lot of goodwill between the U.S. and China and that will remove restraints on industrial productivity,” he said.
