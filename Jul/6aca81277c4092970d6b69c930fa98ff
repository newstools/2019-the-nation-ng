Hundreds of Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) students gathered at Alausa secretariat today to protest against the close down of their school. The students blocked roads around the secretariat and clamoured that the government should intervene in the lockdown of their school by the Non-teaching staff unions, Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics (SSANIP). The students were seen marching around, angrily stating they would not leave until a permanent solution is made.
