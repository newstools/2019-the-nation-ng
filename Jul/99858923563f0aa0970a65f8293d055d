The invited players, made up of some of the finest players in the country, are split into the male and female categories, with 8 each, and are being led by Coach Akinloye and the National Junior Coach, Abdulmumin Babalola. Akinloye stated that every member of the present team is in fine fettle and they have their sights set on the continental showpiece.        “Our mind is set up for the 21st of August when the [African] games will start in Rabat, Morocco. For now, we are in camp and everybody is in high spirit. The Sports Ministry is up and doing, and everyone that is supposed to be here is all here as far as tennis is concerned. We are working and at the end of the day we are going to be happy with the outcome,” Akinloye said. While there are 16 players in camp, only 8 however will represent Nigeria in Morocco. According to the NTF Technical Director, the selection of the 16 players was based upon three criteria: present form, ranking and experience. “We put all this into consideration, bearing in mind we are going to play on clay, which is a different ball game. I think we have done a great job and we will continue to do a great job to make sure Nigeria is well represented and coming out with medals,” he added. Camping began on the 5th of July and will last for six weeks, after which the selected team will depart for Morocco in mid-August.
