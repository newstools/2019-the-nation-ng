The Confederation of African Football wanted a replay of the final but the decision has been dismissed by the international quasi-judicial body. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has confirmed Esperance as winners of 2019 Caf Champions League. An Emergency Executive Committee had ordered to have a replay of the second-leg final clash between the Tunisian outfit and Wydad Casablanca. Players of Esperance were ordered to return their medals and trophy for the rematch at a neutral venue on a yet to be determined date â€“ a verdict that did not go well with the Tunisians.
