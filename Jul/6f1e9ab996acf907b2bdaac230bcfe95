The katsina State Government plans to engage the state branch of the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, on the National Minimum Wage issue to find an amicable solution between labor and the administration The State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, stated this when he received the new leadership of NLC in the state. The Nation recalled that Katsina was among the states that successfully implemented the last minimum wage increment from N7500 to N18, 000 despite disagreements at the initial stage of the negotiations. The workers are therefore optimistic that the state government will not go into long drawn negotiations on the national minimum wage issue, this time around, thanks to the existing cordial industrial relations with the state government. Katsina state has a population of over seven million, out of which about thirty thousand earn are on the government pay roll. The state NLC Chairman, Malam Hussaini Hamisu had earlier told the Governor that they came to congratulate him on his re-election and successful swearing in for a second term in office. He pledged the support and cooperation of the union members with his administration The Union leader further pleaded with the Governor to look into the present challenges facing the State Water Board, especially the situation where they were unable to pay staff salaries for the past 6 months as well as other intractable challenges facing the agency Responding, the Governor promised to carry out a complete overhaul and re-organization of the agency, adding that the state Government is not impressed with its performance and that of the management as presently constituted especially after having pumped so much money to procure its needed spare parts
