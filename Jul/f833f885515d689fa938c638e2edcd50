The FCT Police Command has taken Senator Elisha Abbo to the Magistrate Court in Zuba Abuja for arraignment. Although the number of charges he would be arraigned for is yet unknown, a source in the Command said the Senator would be arraigned for assault amongst others. The Senator was captured on camera assaulting a woman at a sex toy shop in Abuja. After public outcry, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu directed the Commissioner of Police in charge of FCT, CP Bala Ciroma to investigate the matter.

They are presently on their way to Zuba Magistrate court for his arraignment.” On the number of charges he would arraign for, Ciroma said: “I will get back to you on that because I am presently in a meeting.” Details shortly…
