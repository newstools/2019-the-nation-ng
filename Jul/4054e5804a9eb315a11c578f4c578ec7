Edo State Government has objected strongly to the threat by the House of Representatives to take over the Assembly should Governor Godwin Obaseki fail to issue fresh proclamation for inauguration of the House of Assembly within the next one week. It further said the order on the Inspector General to close the House of Assembly was an abuse of process and gross illegality. In a strong-worded statement by Secretary to the Government of Edo, Osarodion Ogie, Edo state dismissed the intervention of the House of Representatives “as an attempt to use federal might to muscle, intimidate and overwhelm functionaries of a federating unit outside the due process of law.” It declared the constitution didn’t confer the power to shut down any House of Assembly on the National Assembly, let alone the House of Representatives. Short of implying the House of Representatives is influenced by vested interests on its intervention, the statement reads: “We advise interested parties who sit in positions of authority in Abuja and are using their offices to influence the House of Representatives to take note that we all ultimately owe a debt of responsibility to the good people of Edo State for our actions.” It will be recalled that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki had blamed National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole for the crisis in the Assembly when the Senate panel visited him in Benin. It warned all concerned parties to tread cautiously to avert plunging the state into deeper crisis, while stating the “illegalities of the House of Representatives will not stand.”
