A leading transport company, Peace Mass Transit, with headquarters in Enugu,Â  has introduced a new welfare scheme which transfers ownership of buses to drivers within an agreed period Chairman of the company Dr. Sam Onyishi expressed optimism that the new policy will bring about a better safety record and as well give drivers an assured sense of belonging and responsibility to handle vehicles in possession with more care. The scheme known as Driver-To-Owner (DTO), first of its kind in the transport industry will come into effect from July 1, 2019. Addressing drivers at the Emene headquarters of the company Dr. Onyishi said that all PMT buses in their possession technically becomes theirs and would formally change ownership if and when they make steady financial returns up to an agreed amount. He assured that the new policy was well thought out and designed to appreciate and empower drivers just as he noted that drivers are more safety conscious when they have a stake in the vehicle they drive. Over 3000 buses in the PMT active fleet are involved in the scheme in the first instance in addition to another 200 units of New King Hiace buses to be injected shortly. Onyishi told the staff that the DTO policy was meant to reward hard work and create a future PMT drivers that families would look forward to with assurance and pride. Before the introduction of the DTO, the company had over the years rewarded diligent drivers who had put in 15 years with a fairly used vehicle on retirement. Peace Mass Transit is the leading transport company in Nigeria with operational depots in over 65 locations across the federation.
