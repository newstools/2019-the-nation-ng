Technology firm, Tecno Nigeria, has stressed the need for more investment in youth development. Its Marketing Manager, Jeff Tang,  who spoke during scholarship presentation to pupils in Lagos, said it is in realisation of the importance of youth development that the firm, through Tecno Foundation, is giving back to the society. He said the firm is desirous of building the future. The kids-centered CSR started in 2014 as one of the ways the brand gives back to its host communities. The initiative has made it possible for many pupils from public primary schools  to win scholarships and  other prizes. As is the custom, schools also got free educational materials. The theme for this year is: Give the Nigerian child a future. In the Lagos region, five schools were selected to participate this year; they include: Coker Primary School, Lagos; Ayanleye Memorial Primary School, Ogba, Lagos; F.A.C.M School 1, Lagos; F.A.C.M School 2, Lagos and Ebenezer Primary School 2, Ojokoro, Lagos. After an examination to select the best students, scholarships were awarded to five pupils from each school courtesy of Tecno Nigeria. There was also a party which brought pupils from over 30 public schools with fun, games and numerous gifts. The occasion was an avenue to highlight the musical and acrobatic talents of the children as there were live musical performances and cultural dance displays. The winners of the scholarship in Lagos include Murital Muiz from Coker Primary School; Michael Oni from Ayanleye Memorial Primary School, Ogba; Kwawou Veronica from F.A.C.M School 1; Adeshina Samuel Ayomiposi from F.A.C.M School 2; and Alade Abdul Azeez from Ebenezer Primary School 2, Ojokoro. Each of them received a N100,000 scholarship grant. Similarly, at the Palms Mall, Ibadan, Port Harcourt; and in Abuja, it was fun as the firm made sure that  the kids had a memorable  celebration. Scholarships were awarded to the best pupils in selected public schools and free Tecno smartphones were
