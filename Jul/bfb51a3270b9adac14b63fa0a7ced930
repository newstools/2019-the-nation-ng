Barely a month after Slize Entertainment Services and Resources Limited struck a N10m recording deal with rapper Razily, courtesy Edo State Government, the record label has presented him with a car and an apartment. The car, a Toyota Camry and the apartment in G.R.A, Benin, are in fulfillment of its contract with the physically challenged Edo-based rapper whose real name is Aigbodion Samuel. Chief Executive Officer of the company, Ehimwenma Maxwell, said the presentation is necessary to encourage the artiste, even as he is busy working on his recordings. Despite being physical challenged, Razily, who raps in Edo language and English languages, believes there is ability in every disability and hopes to encourage others in his condition who may be despairing. In line with his administration’s effort at empowering raw talents with disabilities, Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, had in May, through its Ministry of Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora Affairs, entered into a N10m contract with Slize Entertainment to promote the talented rapper. Showing appreciation the artiste wrote on his Instagram: “I remember when I used to sleep on the Streets widely prone to mosquitoes, now I’m entitled to my apartment and personal car. How many will I continue to count? Thank you @slizeentertainment – Edo State Government @governorobaseki for the empowerment.”
