Osun State Waste Management Agency (OWMA) acting general manager, Festus Ogunbanwo, has reaffirmed the state government’s commitment to eradicating indiscriminate dumping of refuse on roads and other unauthorised places. He stated this while addressing a joint meeting between OWMA and the private sector partnership (PSP) operators on issues of concern to both parties, stressing that all illegal dumps must be totally discouraged because they are detrimental to public health and security. “Waste defaulters must be exposed to face the full wrath of the law. I am therefore, urging PSP members to be alive to their responsibilities of ensuring timely evacuation of refuse and regular payment of tax and levies to avoid being sanctioned. All the law suits filed against the agency have been settled out of court in deference and respect to the governor. I am also commending the harmonious working relationship between the new management and the PSP,” he said. Also speaking, the PSP chairman, Osun State, Wale Olayemi, urged OWMA and his group to remain undaunted in their resolve to ensure a clean environment despite the challenges. Olayemi and Ogunbanwo were unanimous in calling on residents of the state to patronise private waste operators instead of indulging in illegal dumping of wastes. While disclosing that investigation has shown that children are often used to perpetrate such illegal act, Salmanu Akano, media and public affairs officer of OWMA, suggested that campaigns against dumping of waste on median strips should be carried to religious houses and schools. This, he said, was necessary in view of the top priority accorded to health and security in the state and the need for such gesture to be complemented by well-meaning individuals. He added that OWMA needs increased funding for better performance, while indigent PSP members require empowerment through soft loans to procure waste disposal trucks to facilitate their work.
