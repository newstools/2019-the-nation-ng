Andrew Torre, Visa Inc.’s (NYSE:  V) Regional President for Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa has been reappointed to the President’s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), a U.S. private sector council which advises the President of the United States, through the Secretary of Commerce, on strengtheningU.S.-Africa commercial engagement. Torre was first appointed to the council in September 2016. “I have had the great privilege to work in Africa for many years and know it to be a diverse, energetic, and dynamic continent,” said Torre. “We believe that the fintech sector, coupled with African dynamism and entrepreneurship, will play a critical role in bringing sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and that companies like Visa can help increase the bonds of economic cooperation between the United States and African nations. “Our involvement in African economies can help attract more inward investment and stimulate local African businesses to export their ideas to the rest of the world. We want to be a catalyst for African innovation and growth, and a partner in helping to bring inclusive economic opportunity for everyone. This is why we are proud to participate in this important Advisory Council and look forward to continued cooperation with our U.S. and African partners.”
