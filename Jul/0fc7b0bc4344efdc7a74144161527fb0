The Ministry of Labour and Productivity has said Nigeria government has been gender friendly and sensitive. Speaking when the Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) of the World Bank visited the ministry, the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr. William Alo said the government has been doing everything possible to promote the cause of Nigerian women both in the informal and formal sectors of the economy. Alo stressed that legislations and policies in Nigeria are gender friendly, adding that the country is complying with the 35 per cent affirmative action and women are being given four months maternity leave to enable nursing mothers stay home and take care of their babies and, with their wages being paid. “In the Ministry of Labour and Employment, we make sure that there is no discrimination between men and women and we preach against it. In all policies and programmes we make sure there is equality, no discrimination of any sort even in wages,” he added. Earlier in her opening remarks, Julia Viallant, GIL team leader of Africa Gender Innovation, said the purpose of the visit was to figure out “what works and what does not” to improve gender equality.
