A group, Forward Action Bayelsa (FAB), has warned that the three governorship aspirants being sponsored by Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson lacked the capacity and acceptance to win the election for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). FAB urged Dickson to stop any plan to foist any of the three aspirants on the party to avoid an embarrassing defeat by the opposition at the poll. The Restoration Caucus of the PDP, headed by the governor,  named only three persons as members of the caucus that had indicated interest in the governorship forms. They are the senator representing the Bayelsa Central Senatorial District, Douye Diri ,Chief of Staff, Government House, Talford Ongolo, and Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Kemela Okara. But, FAB in a statement in Yenagoa by its Convener, Elder James Ikpi, joined the rising protest against the aspirants. Ikpi described the three aspirants as unpopular, without goodwill and general public acceptance to win the election for PDP. The group advised Dickson to conduct private investigations  on the sellability of the three aspirants, adding that the PDP must not jeopardise its strength by this unpopular decision. Ikpi said: “We want to strongly warn and advise against this move to unilaterally foist a candidate on PDP. Mr. Governor may need to feel the pulse of the people. “He must be sensitive to the ongoing reaction against these three persons. The PDP may be undoing itself and strengthen opposition parties in the election. The PDP ticket is not for one person to decide. PDP must thread with caution.”
