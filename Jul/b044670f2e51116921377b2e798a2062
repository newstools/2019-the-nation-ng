President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the dastardly attack on a funeral procession in Maiduguri, Borno State, resulting in the deaths of mourners. About 23 of the mourners were reportedly murdered by the Boko Haram terrorists. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said Buhari has received assurances from the armed forces that the terrorists who committed the killings “will pay a big price for their action”. He said: “The Federal Government is firmly and resolutely committed to taking all necessary measures to safeguard the nation’s security. This administration is determined to end the menace of terrorism. ” He said that a major exercise has begun to hunt down the attackers with air patrols by the nation’s Air Force and ground operations by the army. The President assured the residents of Maiduguri and the citizens settled in IDP camps that they will receive increased protection against further attacks by the assailants.
