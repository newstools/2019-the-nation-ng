A professor of Biochemistry, Prof Babajide Elemo, has said biological mechanisms help in improving human health and feeding, which leads to high standard of living. He said this at the second annual lecture of the Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, University of Lagos (UNILAG). The lecture had as its theme: “From Molecules to Ecosystem: Biology in the Service to Mankind”. The professor said: “The science of biology has been helping mankind in much way in increasing food production, in combating diseases and in protecting and conserving environment. Biological advances in the field of food and health have resulted in high standard of living.” Going further, he said biology had helped in plants and animal production. “Plant production has been tremendously increased by improving existing varieties and developing new high-yield and disease resistant varieties of plants and animals used as food. “Plant and animal breeders have developed through selective breeding. Using the principles of genetics, we have new better varieties of wheat, rice, corn, chicken, cow and sheep. Poultry breeders have developed broilers for getting quick and cheap white meat.” Elemo described biotechnology as the application of living organisms on the product of living organisms, adding that it has benefitted mankind tremendously. “The insect-pest challenge, weed challenge, drought challenge has been tackled with biotechnology. Also there has been a better crop yield with improved nutrient quality, affordable pharmaceuticals, production of biodiesel and many more,”he said. Head of the department, Prof. Bola Oboh said the department is working on propagating conservation and enhancing food security, and looking to develop natural products that can be used as supplements in treating certain forms of cancer. She also called on alumni and friends of the department to help supply the department with equipment that could further help their researches.
