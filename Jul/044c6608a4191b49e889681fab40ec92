THREE persons have been confirmed dead and two others injured as a result of flood, which ravaged parts of Jos North Local Government, Plateau State. The casualties are residents of Zinaria community in Jos North Local Government area, where the flood pulled down nine houses and rendering the occupants homeless. A witness, Sani Bello, said: “The incident happened on  Wednesday at about 5.30pm, when downpour, resulted in over flooding of the narrow waterway and eventually pulled down fences and residential houses. “The casualties occurred because the victims were indoors during the rain and the building collapsed on them. The water washed three of them away and they died in the process. One of them was my elder sister; she was pregnant and came here for a visit from Naraguta, a nearby community. Her body had been found and buried. “Right now, one lady with a broken leg is in the hospital and a seven-year-old, Ibrahim, is okay now.” However, Senator Istifanus Gyang, who is representing Plateau North in the 9th National Assembly, has visited the area to commiserate with the people. He promised to assist them with resources to create waterways and rebuild their homes. Gyang, who was represented by Daniel Dem, gave financial assistance to the affected families and urged the community to “avoid building on waterways” to avoid such an unfortunate incident. He prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased and speedy recovery of the injured. The Ward Head of the community, Mallam Yahaya Abubakar, who received the gifts on behalf of the victims, hailed the senator for his “show of concern”. He said: “This is not the first time that water would flood this area; no one has come to our aid and whatever we do here to avert flood are community efforts.” One of the beneficiaries, Mohammed Kamilu, lauded the gesture.
