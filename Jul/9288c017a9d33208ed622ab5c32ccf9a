AN accident victim, Michael Irabor, is seeking financial assistance from Nigerians to raise the sum of three million naira for a replacement surgery on his hip. Irabor, a Mass Communication graduate of  the Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu, was knocked down by a motorcyclist at Bwari area of Abuja in 2011. Although he was initially treated at a hospital in the FCT, he experienced excruciating pains upon his return to Lagos. He said: “My story began on April 14, 2011 in Abuja, shortly after I rounded off my Ordinary National Diploma in Mass Communication. I had a motorcycle accident at Bwari area of the capital territory. “After a casual treatment in Abuja, I proceeded to Lagos to begin my industrial training. It was while in Lagos that I started experiencing excruciating pains. The following year, I noticed that a bone was pulling out of my hips. “So I went to a doctor friend who first told me that I was suffering from acute rheumatism. Consequently, I was advised to exercise regularly, that with time, the pain  would disappear. “But by 2014, the pain had become severe and unbearable and the same doctor repeated what he had told me before. “However, it turned out to be a wrong diagnosis. I managed the condition until 2016. “But with the detachment of the  bone from the normal position to my buttocks, I returned to the hospital where it was revealed that I had  Vascular Disorder.” The condition makes walking difficult for him. A medical report from Cedacrest Hospital, Lagos, says he requires  N3million  for a total hip replacement surgery. Donations can be forwarded to a Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) Account Number 0176663635, with the name Micheal Irabor.
