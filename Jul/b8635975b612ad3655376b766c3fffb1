Mr Ibrahim Magu, the Acting Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says the commission’s statistics of arrests, arraignment and convictions has revealed that more youths are involved in criminal activities recently. He said this on Thursday while delivering a lecture at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp ground in Iseyin, Oyo State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the lecture was part of the orientation course for 2019 Batch B corps members in the state. Magu, who was represented by Mr Friday Ebelo, Head, EFCC Ibadan zonal office, noted that many were persuaded into the act due to their choice of providing unbridled access to all shades of evil thoughts. He said that for the young ones to excel in life, they must move away from all forms youthful delinquencies and focus on virtues that would make them future leaders. Magu also cautioned them to always be diligent in their behaviours and to be hard working in order to make meaningful impact in life, saying there was no shortcut to wealth and fame. “Acts of criminality might deliver wealth in the short run, but ultimately there will be misery and gnashing of teeth,” he warned. The EFCC official noted that the only way crime could be reduced if not eradicated is for the youths to always be careful in their activities to ensure they are not involved or become a tool in the hands of the evil people. “It often takes a process to get involve in crime. You must, therefore, be careful about what manner of thought you allow to dominate your mind. “It is equally important that you choose carefully the kind of people you associate with because it also influences what you give priority to in your heart,” he added.
