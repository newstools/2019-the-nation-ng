 Still angered by what it called VAR/Referee induced injustice, Nigeria’s third place opponents Tunisia have announced they will boycott draw for the 2021 AfCON billed for Aida Ballroom Cairo Marriott Hotel on Thursday. This decision according to Tunisian authorities is in protest against the penalty not awarded to the national team during the end of extra time in the semi-final against Senegal. Some Tunisians are however not in support of the boycott preferring instead that they put up appearance and properly register their disdain for the decision. Meanwhile Egyptian referee Jihad Jericha has been appointed to take charge in the third place match billed Wednesday at the Al Salam Stadium. Jericha according to CAF will be assisted by compatriots Mahmoud Ahmed Kamel and Chadian Issa Yaya and also by Joshua Bondo from Botswana. Both Nigeria and Tunisia are singing lamentation songs after failing in their bid to qualify for Friday’s final with Nigeria losing to Algeria while Tunisia lost to Senegal in the semifinals. After failing to get a place in the final, both teams are desperate to at least take something home from Cairo, an indication that the third place match which has been described as ‘small final’ will be full of fireworks. Nigeria last won the third place in 2010 in Angola defeating Algeria by a lone goal, while Tunisia won the third place in 1962 beating Ugandan 3-0.
