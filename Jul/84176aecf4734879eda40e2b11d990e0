A Jos Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama, on Wednesday, sentenced a 19-year-old mechanic, Abdullahi Zakari, to six months imprisonment for stealing N3,000. The presiding Judge, Mr Lawal Suleiman, handed down the sentence after the convict had pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of criminal force and theft and begged for leniency. Suleiman, however, gave the convict an option of N6,000 fine. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Ibrahim Gokwat, told the court that the case was reported at the Laranto Police B Division on June 27, by the complainant, Aminu Shehu, a resident of NEPA area, Zaria Road, Jos. Gokwak said on June 6, the complaint went out to collect money owed him by his client and on his way back, met the convict in company of three others currently at large. He told the court that the convict slapped the complainant on the face and the complainant sustained an injury, adding that in the process, the convict collected N3000 from him. The prosecutor told the court that during police investigation the convict confessed to have committed the offence. The prosecutor said the offences were punishable under Sections 239 and 272 of the Plateau Penal Code. (NAN)
