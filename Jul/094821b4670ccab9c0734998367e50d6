Nigeria should embrace state police as an effective means of crime reduction, the Osolo of Isolo, Oba Kabiru Agbabiaka, said. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday, the traditional ruler said, it would be faster to respond to emergencies and distress situations with state police. Agbabiaka noted that the crime rate was on the particularly in terms of kidnapping, herdsmen/farmers disputes, ritual killings, armed and highway robberies, among others, which should be tackled decisively. He said he was in support of community policing, adding that complementing it with state police would help to improve security. “I am very much in support of community policing because it is the best way to stop some of these identified crimes in society. “We know ourselves and almost everywhere in our community. If there is any crime in our community, members or indigenes of the community know where to go. “They know almost every part of the community and how to identify their people,” the monarch said. The officers, he said, would be familiar with their terrain and know how to nip problems in the bud. “Imagine how long it will take a security officer who is a non-indigene to understudy the new place he is posted to, compared to a person born in the state and posted to one of the areas in his state. “We all know that if there is any problem, he knows what to do, who to call and how to quickly solve the problem of that area before it escalates. “For example, in a situation where kidnap occurs, the state police know where to look with the support of members of the community like farmers, fishermen and others, who know the nooks and crannies of the community, ’’ the monarch said.
