Nollywood actor and incumbent president of the Directors Guild of Nigeria (DGN), Mr. Fred Amata, has been honoured with a chieftaincy title, in Oleh community, Delta State. Amata, a movie director, was named the Okugbe of Oleh Kingdom by the Odio-Ologbo of Oleh kingdom, HRM Anthony Williams Onovughe Ovrawah, at his palace in Oleh. The honor came, following a courtesy visit by members of the DGN to the royal father, led by Engineer Daniel Omoyibo, who was later made patron of DGN. “I’m happy and grateful to God for this,” Amata said. “I also thank the Odio- Ologbo of Oleh kingdom. It came as a surprise but I give God the glory. I was made a chief in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and that makes me carry it loudly. “The title I’ve been given is Okugbe, which means ‘The Gatherer’; one who causes unity, the one that gathers people together which is very close to the name that my father gave me.” Fred Amata is a native of Isoko, in Delta State. His father, Pa John Ifoghale Amata was said to be the first African to shoot a celluloid film entitled ‘Freedom’, in 1957. He was also a famous playwright and actor before he died in 1997. His mother was an actress in the past. His siblings – Zack, Alex, Erumena, Ruke, Elomai – and  his nephew, Jeta, the first son of Zack are all into entertainment, each, as either producer, director, actor or all combined. Amata emerged president of DGN in February, 2016.
