The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has urged the Federal Government to take immediate measures to end harassment, intimidation, attacks and forceful ejection of pastoralists in Southern part of the country. The Coalition gave the advice in a statement signed by its Spokesman, Mr Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, in Abuja on Thursday. Suleiman added that the government should quickly address the issue of their resettlement once and for all. According to him, the Coalition has read the resolutions and decisions of five South East Governors issued on July 9, 2019 over the rising tensions around the expulsion and other hostile acts against the Fulani people by many leaders and communities in many parts of Nigeria. “These tensions have been made worse by the decision of the federal government to suspend the Ruga settlement project. “This addresses most of the genuine grievances and challenges related to the management of livestock assets of the nation, the bulk of which is in the hands of Fulani people,” CNG spokesman said. He added:”We are not impressed by the patronizing and insulting attempt to divide Fulani people and Nigerians by leaders who do not appear to understand the implications of their decisions. “We ask here whether other Nigerians should now arrogate to themselves powers to decide which chemists in the North sell drugs or which business men are making money manufacturing spare parts in the North. “Should Northern Governors assume responsibility for expelling persons from particular ethnic groups that are clearly involved in criminal activities, or designing difficult and impossible conditions for others from these groups which will make it impossible for them to operate.? He urged security agencies to urgently check the escalation of hate-inducing comments by some Southern based political, cultural and religious leaders aiming at endangering the Fulani people rendering them object of indiscriminate attacks.
