Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has again declared the two toll plazas at Lekki and Ikoyi-Lekki link bridge toll free during peak hours on Wednesday. This is in continuation of the government’s real simulation survey of traffic situation in the axis with the aim of reducing traffic congestion around the Lekki-Epe and Ikoyi axis. A statement by the Governor’s Deputy Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, explained a toll-free passage  on Lekki-Epe Expressway and the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge would run between 6:30 am and 9:30 am  and 4:30pm to 7.30pm. The toll free hours, Sanwo-Olu stated, is to allow traffic consultants to the government carry out a comprehensive study of traffic flow around Lekki-Ikoyi-Victoria Island axes, which is part of the initiatives the government is bringing to diffuse vehicular gridlock in major Business Districts. According to the governor, the cost of the toll fees for the study period will be borne by the government. The governor said the administration was undertaking a traffic study with a group of experts to know where the traffic would go when the tollgates are left open for steady movement. “It is only when we do this activity at the peak hour that we will be able to understand how to deal with congestion in these places,” Sanwo-Olu said. He stated the undertaking was necessary for the government to take actions that would lead to reduction of traffic on the axes by 50 per cent. The resultant effect, he said, would lead to decrease in travel time and improved productivity.
