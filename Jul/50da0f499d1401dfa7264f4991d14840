31-Year-Old man, Kelly Udi, was on Thursday arraigned at an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court for allegedly abducting and defiling a 14-year-old girl. He pleaded not guilty to the charge before Magistrate Ejiro Kubeinje. Prosecuting Inspector Donjour Perezi said the defendant committed the offence on June 26 at Demurin Street, Alapere-Ketu. He alleged that Udi abducted the girl for one week and took her to Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, without the knowledge of her guardian, Mr. Chimezie Nwokoro. Perezi said the defendant unlawfully detained the victim with intent to have sex with her. He said when the victim returned home a week after her disappearance, she told her guardian that the defendant took her to Port Harcourt and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. Magistrate Kubeinje granted him to N200,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum.
She adjourned till September 19. An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court remanded an unemployed, John Edet, for allegedly defiling his neighbour’s nine-year-old daughter. Mrs. K. O. Doja-Ojo made the order following an application by the police. She ordered that the case file be duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. Edet was arraigned on a temporary one-count charge of defilement.
His plea was not taken. Prosecuting Inspector Peace Chukwudi alleged that Edet committed the offence at about 4pm on July 9, at Ilasan in Eti-Osa Local Government. Chukwudi said the defendant had unlawful sexual intercourse with the child. She said Edet and the girl’s parents were from the same town. “The girl complained of pains in her private parts and told her parents that Edet had been having carnal knowledge of her whenever they were not around,” the prosecutor said. The case continues on August 14.
