Ahead of the third of the Toronto International Nollywood Film Festival (TINFF) bill to hold on September 7, 2019 at the York Cinema, Canada, organisers of the event have announced Nigeria’s model Anita Osikhena Osikweme as the host for this year’s edition of the award. Anita, who is the face of popular cosmetic brand, Zaron, recently emerged the first-runner up for the Most Beautiful Model in Nigeria and brand ambassador to Wholesale Naija hair brand amongst others. The Toronto international Nollywood Film Festival is a community event that brings filmmakers from around the globe to celebrate diversity through film and organisers have that all hands are on deck to make this edition spectacular. On hosting the forthcoming award, Anita disclosed that she is privileged to have been invited to serve in that capacity. “I am glad as this further indicates that the brand is not just being recognized here in Nigeria alone but across the world and I am super excited that aside been the model host, works from Nigeria will also be considered at the September ceremony,” she said. “I’m urging every young persons out there to be encouraged and never give up.”
