Super Eagles forward says he is happy to have his confidence back after netting twice for Leicester City in their 2-2 stalemate with League One side Rotherham United in a pre-season game at the New York Stadium on Saturday, NationSport reports. The Nigeria international had ended his 11-month goal drought on Tuesday, when he headed in the second goal of City’s 3-0 pre-season win over Cambridge United. With three goals in two games, the former Manchester City striker continues to make case for himself to the national team set-up after being left out of the bronze-winning Nigeria team to the Egypt 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The 22-year old who was deep in form towards the end of last season, notably missing a huge opportunity to potentially deny Manchester City the title at the Etihad Stadium in May is now back amongst the goals and that’s given his confidence almost priceless boost. “I am delighted, I am happy getting two goals today. Hopefully I can take that into the season. I think it’s important for my confidence. It has been a long time coming but I am happy again. I think I can take it fully into the season. “We have a big squad, so many players who are good footballers. Everyone is competing and fighting for a place,” he said in a postmatch interview.
