 Indications that Thursday’s Confederation of African Football (CAF) Annual General Assembly will embrace new ways of doing business emerged on Wednesday as the Executive body announced changes in management of some competitions on the continent. CAF Champions league one of the topmost club competitions whose final was hitherto played on home and away basis will henceforth be a one legged affair to be played on neutral ground. The decision is not unconnected with the controversy that trailed this year’s CAF Champions league final between Esperance of Tunisia and Wydad Casablanca of Morocco which is yet to be resolved. The Second tear club competition the Confederation Cup final will equally be one legged final to be played a neutral ground. Egg heads of the 54 member Confederation believe this will eliminate fracas and ensure that none of the finalists have undue advantage. In another development, African Women Cup of Nations which hitherto had 8 teams competing will henceforth feature 12 teams thus offering opportunity for extra four countries to showcase their skills. Only eventual champions Nigeria, hosts Ghana, South Africa, Cameroon, Algeria, Mali, Zambia and Equatorial Guinea participated at the AWCON 2018 which will mark the last time the championship will feature 8 teams.
