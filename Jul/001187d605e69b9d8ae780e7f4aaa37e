Former Super Eagles’ coach Bonfrere Jo says the Super Eagles lacked the tactical cohesion to excel at just concluded 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt but maintained that the team can excel if properly managed. The Super Eagles finished in the third position to clinch the bronze medal for the record eight-time, after piping Tunisia 1-0 in the best loser’s final. The team was widely criticized after the uninspiring semi-final loss to Algeria and Bonfrere believed the technical crew led by Gernot Rohr assembled young individual players who struggled to create scoring chances. “Yes, they lacked tactics and cohesion at the Nations Cup. They were not creating the scoring chances we expected, but the players are young, they are good individually and if well managed, yes, they can do it (in future),” Bonfrere said. “Nigeria has plenty of talents. They are young and they can play together more. Yes, it will be a good team in the future”. Bonfrere who led Nigeria to Olympic gold medal in Atlanta 1996 and silver medal added that Senegal was unfortunate to fall short of the title for the second time. “The final was great, Senegal was good but, yes, Algeria played more tactics. They are the worthy champions of Africa,” he concluded.
