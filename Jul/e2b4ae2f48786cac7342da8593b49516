A lawmaker representing Badagry Federal Constituency, Mr. Babatunde Hunpe, has distributed over 3,000 uniforms worth N6 million to pupils in 20 primary schools. Distributing the uniforms to the pupils of LA Primary School, Iyaafin, Badagry, on Thursday, he said this was part of his campaign promises to his constituents. Hunpe, represented by his wife, Elizabeth, said education was pivotal to the development process of any community. “Coming to Iyaafin today to distribute uniforms to pupils of St. Thomas Primary School is part of my belief that children are the greatest assets any society can possess. “To achieve a brighter future, we have to pay attention to the progress of our children. “This is just a tip of the iceberg; I am still coming with more goodies for you my children. “I implore you to face your studies, because you are the leaders of tomorrow and future leaders of a greater Nigeria,” he said. Hunpe said he had distributed uniforms to other pupils in some primary schools in Badagry West and Olorunda Local Council Development Area (LCDA) before coming to Badagry Local Government. “We have distributed the uniforms to pupils at Methodist Primary School, Ashipanu; Salvation Army Primary School, Anlo-Boglo; LA Primary School, Keta West and Gberefu LA Primary School, Apa, all in Badagry West LCDA. “Also, we have done the same thing at Anglican Primary School, Ilado; LA Primary School, Mowo; Community Nur/Pry School, Esepe/Mushin/Obele; Morogbo Primary School, Morogbo and Anglican Nur/Pry School, Igborosun. “We will proceed to other primary schools within Badagry today and tomorrow to distribute the remaining uniforms to them,” he said. The school’s Assistant Head Teacher, Mrs. Victoria Awolesi, thanked Hunpe for the kind gesture, urging other politicians to emulate him. A pupil, Funke Ogundipe, thanked the legislator for providing uniforms for them.
