No fewer than 303 students from 17 states have received $7.5 million in full or partial scholarships from 225 American universities and colleges to study in the United States for the 2019-2020 academic session. Acting United States Consul-General Osman Tat stated this in Lagos during the 2019 Education USA pre-departure orientation for students who have received offers of admission and scholarships to for US study this fall. Tat, who noted the US remains a top destination for international students, said the list of acceptances for Nigerian students for the upcoming academic year cuts across many of the 50 U.S. states. “I congratulate each one of you on your tremendous success. This is a very important step in your life. I encourage you to make the most out of your time in the United States to acquire the requisite skills and knowledge needed to support Nigeria’s development,” Tat told the group of U.S.-bound students. The students have been accepted for undergraduate and graduate degree programmes at top notch U.S. institutions ranging from Ivy League universities, liberal arts colleges, women’s colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), to community colleges. They include Stanford University, The George Washington University, Johns Hopkins University, Purdue University, Tufts University, Boston University, Emory University, and Howard University, among many others. The pre-departure orientation is intended to assist students to prepare for their move from Nigeria to the United States.  The event included interactive sessions on topics such as travel planning, adjusting to life in America, safety on campus, and F-1 visa rules for international students. Participants also had the opportunity to meet with students currently studying in the United States who offered tips on how to prepare for the US academic, social, and cultural environment. Among the departing students are 13 Education USA Opportunity Fund grantees —10 undergraduate and three graduate students, with full scholarships — who received financial aid to cover the up-front cost of obtaining admission. Annually, through the Opportunity Fund Programme, the US Consulate’s EducationUSA Advising Centre assists talented low-income students who are good candidates for admission to US colleges and universities, by funding their application process. According to the latest Open Doors Report, published annually by the Institute of International Education, Nigeria is the 13th highest sending country of international students to the US, with about 12, 693 Nigerians currently studying in the United States.
