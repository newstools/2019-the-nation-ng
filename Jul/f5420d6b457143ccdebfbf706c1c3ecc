Medview Airline has confirmed that its flight VL2105 enroute Lagos from Abuja on Tuesday experienced cabin depressurisation while descending from 32,000ft altitude. The airline’s Chief Operating Officer, Mr Michael Ajigbotoso said this in a statement in Lagos on Thursday. Ajigbotoso said the Captain noticed a warning sign of cabin depressurisation while descending from 32000ft altitude and immediately briefed passengers on board on the development. He said the pilot then referred to the check list and applied the necessary procedure to mitigate the situation. The oxygen masks dropped and were in good working condition for the passengers’ usage. “The captain called for priority landing because he had been on number seven on queue,’’ he said. Ajigbotoso said the pilot-in-command was obliged and he made a safe landing, adding that the passengers were calm since it did not pose a serious danger. He said the incident was promptly reported to the necessary authorities and investigation was ongoing. Ajigbotoso said the situation was professionally handled according to required operational standard procedures.
