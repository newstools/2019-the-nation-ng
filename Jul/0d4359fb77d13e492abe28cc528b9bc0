The Lagos State Government will rehabilitate dilapidated public schools to make them conducive for learning, Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat said on monday. Hamzat spoke when he inspected some of the schools. The inspected schools are Maryland Nursery and Primary school in Maryland and Ahmad Memorial Muslim Nursery Primary in Agege, “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration is prioritising educational section because the education of our children is important and the environment where they are taught is equally important. “One of the reasons why we are here is to see for ourselves the state of some of our schools that are in bad shapes so that we can come up with strategies to put them in good shapes. “Very soon our children will be going on holiday, and before they resume we want to make sure we achieve some infrastructure upgrade,” Hamzat said. He added: “We want to protect our children from the sun and the rain when they are learning in their classrooms. We want to decongest some of the classrooms; we also noticed that some of the doors, windows and furniture are bad. “We saw a whole lot of structural issues and we want to make sure that our children are comfortable when they in the school.”
