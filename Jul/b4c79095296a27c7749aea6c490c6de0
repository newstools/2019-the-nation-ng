The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) today, 5th July 2019, dispatched its first team of officials to coordinate the 2019 Hajj activities in Saudi Arabia. Addressing the team at the International Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Chairman of the Commission, Barrister Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad, admonished them to remember that they are travelling to Saudi Arabia as officials of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and therefore stressed that discipline, organised team work, commitment to the task ahead are crucial to the success of 2019 Hajj. He emphasized on the importance of their good conduct to the image of the country. According to Mukhtar, the impression they create is the yardstick that will be used to judge Nigerian pilgrims. He reminded them of their assignments, which hover around ensuring comfort, dignity and security of pilgrims, without whom there will not be Hajj officials. The Chairman urged them to respect hierarchy, treat all pilgrims well without discrimination, respect constituted authorities and maintain spirit of brotherhood among all pilgrims notwithstanding their nationality. The team of 39 NAHCON staff on advance assignment in Saudi Arabia are responsible for receiving pilgrims upon arrival in Madinah and Jeddah Airports, their feeding, beddings in their various accommodation, security, transportation, enlightenment and general monitoring. The advanced team, led by Madinah coordinator, who is also the Acting Secretary to the Commission, is expected to liaise with Saudi authorities in coordinating movement of pilgrims and updating the relevant authorities on new developments from the host country as they are being released.
