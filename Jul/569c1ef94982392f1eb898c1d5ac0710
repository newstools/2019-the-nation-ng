An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, has ordered that a 57-year-old father, Mr. Mojeeb Fashola, accused of sexually assaulting his three daughters, be remanded in prison pending legal advice. Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat, who did not take Fashola’s plea, remanded him at Kirikiri Prison and ordered that the case file be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. She adjourned the case till October 14. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Benson Emuerhi had told the court that the defendant committed the offences between April and May at his home in Ayetoro, Ijanikin, near Badagry. He alleged that the defendant sexually assaulted one of the girls aged eight by using his finger to penetrate into her private parts. Emuehi added that on a later date, the defendant also unlawfully assaulted his two other daughters, aged 10 and 12 by touching their buttocks and breasts seductively. The prosecutor said when the victims’ mother threatened to report the matter to the police, the defendant beat her up and hit her head and hand with a pestle. He said the defendant was arrested by the police and that the case was transferred to the Gender Section at Ikeja Police Command for further investigation. Emuerhi said the offence contravened sections 135, 170 and 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
