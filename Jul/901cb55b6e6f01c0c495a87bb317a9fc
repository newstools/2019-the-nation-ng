Less than 24 hours after a Boeing 737-300 aircraft belonging to Air Peace experienced hard landing at runway of Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, the airline said Wednesday that its aircraft was airworthy. The airline said ongoing in house investigation into the accident revealed that nothing was wrong with aircraft, but attributed the accident to possible pilot error. In a statement signed by its Safety Manager, Godfrey Ogbogu, he said the pilot landed the airplane harder than intended, which affected the nose wheel. The statement reads:” The landing incident of Flight P4 7191 at Murtala Muhammed International Airport on Wednesday, July 23, 2019, has nothing to do with the airworthiness of the airplane. “Our preliminary in house investigation indicates that in a bid to make a positive touchdown as required by procedures during such weather operations, the pilot landed the airplane harder than intended which affected the nose wheel. “There are issues with the airworthiness of the aircraft as Air Peace Limited assures of best maintenance practices at all times and spares No resources to that effect. “The management wishes to assure the flying public that Air Peace has never stopped appraising its safety practices and procures as demanded by industry standards.” Meanwhile, the runway where the aircraft carried out hard landing has been cleared for normal flight operations.
