The Convener of Yes, We are Winning Foundation (YWNW), Ibigbami Muyiwa Mark, has appealed to the federal governments to come up with policies that include the physically challenged persons. Mark said this in an interview with The Nation at the World Skills Day Seminar organised by Yes, We are Winning Foundation held recently at Alliance Global Building, Ikeja, Lagos. It featured presentations, networking musical rendition, panel discussants and the presentations from members of the Down Syndrome Foundation. He said that “providing employability skills for Nigeria youths, especially the physically challenged and other disadvantaged youths across the country, will be a veritable instrument to enhance economic growth in Nigeria.” The Group Marketing Manager of Ziza Digital, Agbons Igiewe, who spoke on the topic: Digital Media as a tool for Investment Opportunities, urges youths to use technology effectively to develop their skills and position themselves for global jobs and opportunities. Igiewe, said technology is what is driving business everywhere in the world and seeing that youths today are have access to internet, it is imperative that they use internet productively and create jobs for themselves. “We are in a global world and the opportunities for new jobs through the internet. It is important that young people look for those opportunities and explore them”, she said. A physically challenged gospel guitarist, Djagbo Bishop, charges youths to develop their minds and focus on their dreams despite the seeming challenges facing the country. Bishop, who plays guitar with no palm, and spoke on ‘Fashioning my skills for profitability and economic Growth,’ said “I was born with a congenital amputation of my palms and fingers but I want to say the greatest challenge that a man can have is a handicapped mind and not physical challenges”.
