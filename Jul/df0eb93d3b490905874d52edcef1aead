An Ilorin Magistrates’ Court on Thursday remanded three emloyees, Jenmo Usman, Iliyasu Mohammed and Maude Yusuf for allegedly attempting to kidnap their employer, Sarafadeen Yusuf. The defendants were brought before the court on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and attempted kidnapping. Chief Magistrate, Ibijoke Olawoyin, ordered the defendants to be remanded at Oke-kura Prison, Ilorin, and adjourned the case till July 18 for further mention. The Prosecutor, Insp. Al-Hassan Jubril informed the court that the suspects called the victim with phone number 08029158831 and threatened him to pay N2 million otherwise he would be kidnapped or killed. Al-Hassan said arrangement was made by the police to lay ambush for the suspects at an agreed point. He said that the suspects were arrested by the police on June 13 at the agreed point where they picked the black polythene bag containing the ‘ransom’, but which had stones and sticks stuffed in it instead of money. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The Prosecutor said the alleged offences Contravened Sections 2 and 3 of Kwara State Prohibition of Kidnapping Law 2010 and section 398 of the Penal Code Law. He prayed the court to remand the defendants in prison custody pending the outcome of investigation. (NAN)
