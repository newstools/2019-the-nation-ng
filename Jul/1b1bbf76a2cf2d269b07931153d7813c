Nigeria wrestler, Alfred Parkistan is chasing a podium finish in his debut at the 2019 Africa Games billed to hold from 19th to 31st August, 2019 in Rabat, Morocco. The National Greco Roman Wrestling Champion qualified for the 12th African Games after defeating Bright Orobekvion of Edo state in the final of the 63kg at the 3rd Governor Dickson National Classics in Yenegoa. In a chat with NationSport, the Delta born wrestler said he was determined to secure his place at the continental showpiece despite the tough oppositions in at the Classics. “I am happy that I will be representing Nigeria at the 2019 All Africa Games in Morocco. My first outing at the 2018 Africa Wrestling Championships in Port Harcourt did not go well at all. I tried my best but lost my third fight. This time around my target is to train hard and stand on the medal podium singing the national anthem in Morocco. “I was determined to win the final of the 3rd Governor Dickson classics in Yenegoa, although my opponent gave me tough time. I came determined and very prepared and promised myself not to leave Bayelsa until I win a gold medal. “My uncle introduced me into wrestling and wrestling has made me who I am. My coach, Christopher Clark is my role model and I want to be greater than him,” said Parkistan, who is tutored by former National and African champion, Ibo Oziti.
