A statement in Calabar on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Christian Ita, quoted Governor Ayade as describing Jedy-Agba’s nomination as a big plus for Cross River. “I heartily congratulate my brother and friend, Prince Goddy Jeddy Agba, on his nomination as Minister. “It is a fitting nomination and a big plus for Cross River considering Jeddy’s track record of service to Nigeria. “And I have no doubt that he will bring his wealth of experience to bear on any ministry he is eventually assigned to,” the governor said. While expressing optimism the ministerial nominee will make Cross Riverians proud as a minister, Ayade called for closing of ranks across party divides to give Jeddy-Agba the needed support to succeed. “The interest of Cross River comes first. Let us therefore, rise above party and ethnic affiliations to give one of own, our son, the necessary support he needs to succeed as minister,” he further stated.
