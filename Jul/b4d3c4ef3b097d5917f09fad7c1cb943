“ONE thing that makes me wonder whether there is any God presiding over the affairs of man is the fact that while good people perish, evil men flourish. Take for instance, Talleyrand. He is most likely going to die in his bed “. Talleyrand duly died in his bed many years after, long after Napoleon had succumbed to gastric cancer in detention camp on the Island of St Helena. For centuries, Napoleon’s fatal affliction was attributed to arsenic poisoning by his English conquerors. When Talleyrand was told of Napoleon’s death, the rogue statesman and extraordinary emissary famously described by Napoleon as “ a piece of dung in silk stockings”, dismissed it as an item of news and not a great event. “I am an atheist, thank God”, Oscar Wilde, the rogue Anglo-Irish genius, famously concluded.
