Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has tasked security agencies in the country to ensure that the killers of Afenifere leader, Mrs Funke Olakunrin are brought to book in no distant time. The Governor in a statement by the commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo said the killing was unacceptable. Akeredolu said “this is one death too many. It is unacceptable and condemnable.” According to the governor, “this sad development once again, heightens the level of fear that has pervaded our nation even as it represents a despicable commentary in all ramifications.” “To say the least, it represents an unenviable turning point, the depth of everything that is evil,” “On behalf of the State Executive Council, the Governor symphatizes with our foremost leader and indeed the people of the state over this dastardly act,” he added. He appealed to all and sundry to remain calm and allow the Police to unravel the perpetrators of the murder.
