A combined team of men of the Navy, Police and Customs at the weekend in Ilorin, Kwara State, paraded 24 persons in connection with alleged smuggling of bags of rice from Benin Republic to Nigeria. The security agents also displayed 850 bags of 50 kilograms of rice allegedly smuggled into the country by the suspects. Parading the suspects, Police Commissioner Kayode Egbetokun said 15 of the suspects were arrested in Offa by the officers of the Navy School of Health Sciences, who he said impounded the rice. He said the 15 suspects were the drivers transporting the rice in vehicles to destinations where they were asked to keep the items. Egbetokun, who said the Navy handed over the suspects and the impounded goods to the Police for investigations, added that investigations conducted by the police led to the arrest of the remaining nine suspects. He said the suspects, whom he described as the owners of the smuggled goods, were arrested at locations within and outside the state. Egbetokun said the suspects confessed that they bought the rice in Cotonou, Benin Republic, to sell in Nigeria. The commissioner, who addressed reporters at the command headquarters in Ilorin in company of other officers, said the police had concluded investigation and would hand over the suspects and the goods to the Customs for further investigations. Head of the delegation of the Customs at the briefing, Adamu Yahaya, a Chief Superintendent of Customs, thanked the Police and the Navy for doing a good job. He said the Customs would judiciously carry out its assignment on the matter.
