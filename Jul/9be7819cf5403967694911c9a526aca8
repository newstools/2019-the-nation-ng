An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Monday remanded two men at Kirikiri Prisons for allegedly robbing an Uber driver, Charles Ekwamu, of his Toyota Camry car. Daniel Anagor, 28 and Samuel Effiong, 21, were also accused of attempting to strangle their victim after dispossessing him of his car. They are facing a three-count charge of armed robbery, conspiracy and attempted murder before Chief Magistrate M.I. Dan-Oni. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada said the defendants committed the offence with others at large on June 14 at Abijo, Lekki, Lagos. He said Ekwamu was attacked while driving the defendants and his accomplices. They suddenly brought out a rope and a knife and attacked him, he said. Eruada alleged that the defendants tried to strangle him with a rope while he was being robbed of his car with number-plate KJA 116 EY. He said they also robbed their victim of his phone, five Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards and N250,000. The prosecutor said the defendants were arrested by some policemen while trying to escape. Chief Magistrate Dan-Oni did not take the defendant’s plea. She ordered that the defendants be remanded at Kirikiri pending an advice by Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The case continues on August 5.
