Famous actor, producer and director, Muyiwa Ademola, popularly called Mr Authentic, is set to release his new movie which he revealed will hit the cinemas across the south west on August 9th, 2019. Ademola said the movie is centered on “The past- the present- and the future- which are all connected”. This comes 11 years after his last movie ‘Owo Okuta’ which was screened in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. The actor disclosed this via an Instagram post where he posted the jacket of the movie. “The above displayed is the last movie I took to the cinemas,” he wrote. Mr Authentic explained the reason why he had not produced a movie. “I took a deep breath and a little rest because I felt people weren’t keen on my type of stories again,” he said. “So, I paid attention to acting in peoples’ films alone.” Ademola has produced over 20 films and in 2005, his movie, ‘Ori’ won the best indigenous film at the maiden edition of African Movie Academy Award (AMAA). Some of his other notable works include ‘Alapadupe’, ‘JJ’, ‘Ile’ and ‘Iranse Aje.’
