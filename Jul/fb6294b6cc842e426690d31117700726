Super Eagles goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi has said that the players know what is at stake and are ready for the game against Cameroon at the Alexandria Stadium, Egypt. The Kaizer Chiefs FC of South Africa goalkeeper is expected to return to the starting lineup after he was rested in the last game against Madagascar. The former Warri Wolves goalkeeper admitted that Nigeria was hurt in the shock 2-0 defeat to Madagascar in the last group B game and expressed belief that the team would come out stronger against Cameroon. “We are looking forward to our game, which is most important to us. Sometimes it is okay to lose a game to prepare you for the next game that is very important. The Cameroon game is more important than Madagascar game. Everybody is trying to be fit mentally and physically to ensure we overcome Cameroon,” Akpeyi said. He added: “Playing against Cameroon is like playing with any other team in the tournament. To me, there is nothing special that will make me rate Cameroon better than any other team. Like statistics showed before our last game, Nigeria was rated above Madagascar and nobody would have predicted that Nigeria would lose to them. This is football and you welcome everything.  Whoever shows determination will win at the end of the day.”
