First civilian Lagos State Governor Alhaji Lateef Jakande said on Monday that the best gifts he got from God include the opportunity of serving the state and clocking 90 years. Jakande was the governor between 1979 and 1983, before his second tenure was truncated by a military coup. The elder statesman spoke with reporters yesterday at his Ilupeju home. “I thank God for giving me the opportunity to serve Lagos. No better gift will one have than the opportunity to serve my people. I thank God for that,” he said. Jakande advised young politicians to make up their mind to serve and know what they want to do in power. He said young politicians have to be educated to get ready to serve. The elder statesman was happy that successive civilian governments that came after him served Lagos and kept the vision he had for the state. According to him, his success in Lagos State was because of the programmes he introduced, which had the acceptance of Lagosians. Jakande added that the development of Lagos State in recent time had been very commendable, saying that “those who came after me have done very well”. He said the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration had started on a good note, adding that he would further sustain the tempo in the development of Lagos that he and other administrations had started.
