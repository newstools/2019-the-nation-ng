The former Ajax Amsterdam of Holland midfielder therefore the urged fans of both teams to live in the reality, insisting that a determined and confidence side will win the match. “Not only Africa, in the whole world, we know about this rivalry-, and we also need to rationalise this, I think we have our fans already to take care of because they are very emotional about the game, talking about the history. “We need to live in the present and the present means we have to work with confidence. We have seen that the Nigeria team have some difficulties, which make them dangerous. And I am sure they can improve on it. So we have to focus on our game. The game will involve some young guys and it is very important that they enjoy the game,” Seedorf said. The former Deportivo La Coruña of Spain manager said he is better prepared for the clash while urging his players to show their good qualities by going for victory against Nigeria. “I am more than ready, for me it is a normal game and I have to prepare myself and be ready for the match. We have to show we are better than them. That is the match we have analysed the day after our last game, scoring is a consequence of the thing you do before, and I think we have given so much attention to it.
