President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday swore in Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad as the substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN). He became the 18th CJN at the brief ceremony. Muhammad, who took over from the immediate past and suspended CJN, Walter Onnoghen, was screened and cleared by the Senate last week. He has been on acting capacity since January, 2019.
