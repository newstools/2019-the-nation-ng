He spoke during the maiden meeting of the new board with workers of the Commission in Abuja, on Thursday. “Everyone is aware of the very important roles capital markets play. We need to attract investments to develop our country and each one of you play a critical role in that regard. “We are happy to be here and we are going to enable you do well so that together, we can find solutions to our challenges. We are going to learn, brainstorm and work together to move the capital market forward,” he said. According to him, the nation needs investments in order to be able to attain its developmental goals, adding that the capital market plays a huge role in that respect. He therefore urged the workers to work with the board to achieve this. He said: “We need to see how we can move forward to have a more orderly market, a market that is fair and transparent and can attract investments to build Nigeria. We need a market that is attractive to investors, both local and foreign “We aspire to have a capital market where the rules are enforced and where the public who invests are all protected. We need to re inforce the public trust. I therefore enjoin everyone to help us towards building a capital market that this country deserves.” He assured that the members of the board would work swiftly but surely to ensure that the nation has the capital market Nigerians would be proud of. “There has been incredible progress in our capital markets in the last 20 years; we need to move fast leveraging on technology and we know that we can be the best and we aspire to be the best,” he added.
