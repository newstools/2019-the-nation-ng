A prominent monarch in Akoko Northwest local government area of Ondo state, Oba Sanni Walidu, the Onigedegede of Gedegede on Thursday said he had not remained the same since his recent attack by suspected Fulani herdsmen in his palace. The royal father cried out over his poor health condition since the recent assault on him. According to him, he had visited medical institutions, spritual homes and native doctors without positive result because of the shock that traumatised him. The monarch said the way his attack was carried out had made many of his subjects who are predominant farmers scared of going to their farms which herdsmen used their cattle to destroy on a daily basis. A farmer from the town, Taiwo Akande noted that if their monarch was attacked by herdsmen and nothing happened what will then be their own faith. He urged the government to be proactive on Fulani/Host communities relationship in order to bring lasting remedy to the affected communities. It would be recalled that farmers in Gedegede recently reported the destruction of their farm crops to the monarch who in turn invited the herdsmen. However, rather than allowing resolution of the matter, the herdsmen allegedly pounced on the monarch which consequently led to the intervention of the Ondo state government.
