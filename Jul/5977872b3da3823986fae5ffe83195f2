Lagos State government will soon pay the insurance benefits of its dead workers. The benefits will be received by their families, Local Government Service Commission chairman Babatunde Rotinwa said at the weekend. Those to be paid were Councils’ and State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) workers. Speaking in Alausa, Ikeja at the presentation of letters to the beneficiaries, Rotinwa said the exercise underscored the government’s kind gesture. Rotinwa said the benefits would be paid in conjunction with the LASACO Assurance Plc. He said the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration was committed to the welfare of civil servants and others, adding that the presentation was a new approach in the verification adopted by the government for proper documentation before collection of cheques. Permanent Secretary Finance Ministry Mrs Funmi Balogun advised the beneficiaries to spend the money judiciously. Speaking on behalf of LASACO Assurance Plc Managing Director Mr. Segun Balogun, Deputy Managing Director (Technical) Mr. Biodun Rasaq, hailed the government for paying workers’ premium promptly.
