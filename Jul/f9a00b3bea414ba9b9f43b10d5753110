Insurance giant AXA Mansard  has announced its partnership with the Lagos State Government as the state prepares to conduct the 2019 Tree Planting Exercise. A statement by the firm stated that the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency, LASPARK 2019 Tree Planting exercise will hold on  July 14, 2019 with the theme: “Clean and green is our perfect dream”. The event is billed to hold across all the 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in the state. AXA Mansard Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, Mr Kola Oni said insurance companies are in a privileged position to enhance knowledge on climate risks in order to better understand and tackle climate change. The statement said: “AXA Mansard is also aware of the role it can play in promoting environmental protection awareness amongst its stakeholders, contributing to improving the understanding of global and local environmental risks, and committing to addressing climate change. “The Lagos State Government in 2012, committed to an internationally recognised tree planting programme to plant 10 million trees by 2020. This commitment is based on the fact that tree planting remains one of the most effective ways of absorbing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that are harmful to the environment from the atmosphere. The Initiative is therefore aimed at improving environmental sustainability in Nigeria. “As both a responsible insurer and an environmentally responsible corporation, AXA Mansard has a responsibility to leverage its expertise and take action to reduce climate risks; supporting this initiative will enable us perform this responsibility successfully.” LASPARK General Manager, Mrs Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola noted that the exercise is a universally progressive idea to integrate private bodies into government policies and programmes in order to achieve a broad and enduring legacy, adding that tree is a significant accessory to mental and physical comfort.
