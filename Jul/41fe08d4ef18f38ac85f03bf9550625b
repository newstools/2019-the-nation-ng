An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court on Monday sentenced a driver, Adeyemi Adeshina, to 48 months imprisonment for stealing N326,000 from a colleague’s mobile banking application. Magistrate M. O. Ope-Agbe convicted Adeshina, 47, after he pleaded guilty to a four-count charge of stealing. She sentenced Adeshina to 12 months imprisonment on each of the counts, without an option fine. Mrs. Ope-Agbe said the sentences would run concurrently, meaning that Adeshina would spend only 12 months in jail. Reviewing the case, Prosecuting Sergeant Cyriacus Osuji said Adeshina committed the offences on December 7, 8 and 10, 2018, at 1A, 2nd Street, Osborne Foreshore Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos. He said the convict stole N326,000 in three tranches from John Wamdeo through a mobile transfer. Osuji said the complainant used to ask the convict to help him transfer money with his phone. “On the day in question, Adeshina transferred N100,000 three times from Wamdeo’s Diamond Bank mobile App into his own Guaranty Trust Bank account no. 0268789586 without Wamdeo’s knowledge. “He also stole N26,000 which the complainant gave him to keep, making all the money stolen to be N326, 000,” he said.
