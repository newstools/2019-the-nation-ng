In its quest to boost brand equity and loyalty, Peer Icon Partners Limited, a strategic communication company held interface and discussion sessions for owners and managers of major brands across the country. The seminar which centered on impact branding, tagged, ‘Bestsellers seminar’ was attended by top social media influencers in Nigeria. Speaking during the seminar, the facilitator and Principal Strategist, Peer Icon Partners, Nosa Emma-Iyamu, said the goal of Bestseller is to introduce participants to the concept of “Impact Branding” as a marketing tool that will equip them with the principles needed to building a truly impactful brand generating positive returns to the society beyond being “for profit.” “Influencer marketing can be traced back to the early 20th century. Over time it has evolved from product-centered marketing to value-centered marketing with the rise of social media platforms and the consumer being encouraged to participate to create content of their own. With the flood of information available to the consumers, the need for social media influencers became justifiable as they exude trust through the content that they create,” he explained. He noted that the challenge with social media influencers in Nigeria is that majority of them are not “niche” but “me-too” brands used only as media channels. “Only a few can be categorised as opinion leaders and experts in a field but Social Media Influencers have the potential to drive impactful change in their communities and the nation at large; establishing a recognised brand as they do so.”
