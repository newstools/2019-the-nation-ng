The national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the assault on a female attendant at an Abuja sex toy shop, Bibra, by Senator Ishaku Abbo representing Adamawa North on the platform of the PDP. In a statement Wednesday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it detests and completely condemned the lawmaker’s action. The party said it would not condone such act lawlessness and callousness as exhibited by the senator. The statement reads: “Our party is also shocked that the harmless victim of the unprovoked assault is said to be a nursing mother, who ought to be protected. “Though this is a personal conduct of an individual, which has no bearing with the culture of our party, the PDP however holds that no responsible person will condone such an attitude. “In the light of this, the NWC has commenced investigation into the matter and summons Senator Elisha Abbo in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the PDP and code of conduct of our members. “In the same vein, the party has taken note of the immediate action taken by the Senate. “The PDP, at all levels of engagement, is reputed for her utmost respect and commitment towards the rights, safety and wellbeing of our citizens, particularly our women and cannot tolerate any callous assault on any Nigerian. “The PDP, therefore, assures Nigerians that it will always stand on the side of justice and will never spare a thought in taking action on any of its members found wanting, particularly those elected or appointed into public offices”.
