The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria NAHCON has announced additional reduction of 200 Riyals from 2019 Hajj fare of intending pilgrims of Zamfara State. This was revealed in a statement released by Head Public Affairs, NAHCON, Hajia Fatima Sandra Usara, on behalf of the commission’s chairman/CEO, Barr Abdullahi Muktar. The cut followed renegotiation with the state’s home/accommodation owner in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The amount, which is equivalent to N16, 492.08, has decreased the Zamfara State fares to N1, 467, 896.57 for 2019 Hajj. The NAHCON chairman thanked the new government of Zamfara State under leadership of Governor Mohammed Bello Mattawalle, for the support and understanding exhibited in the course of further bargaining. “The Commission also seizes this medium to appreciate and congratulate the Zamfara State Muslim Pilgrims’ Welfare Board for its endeavour in mobilising intending pilgrims despite challenges experienced in the state and for the commendable arrangements already in place for the airlift of registered pilgrims to the holy land,” the statement read. Intending pilgrims are encouraged to contact the state’s Muslim pilgrims’ welfare board to secure the surplus amount.
