The Southwest Chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Mr Femi Oke, has said the plan of the Federal Government to establish food processing centres in the 774 local government areas of the country will boost rural job creation. Oke recalled that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo told farmers at a meeting that the government intends to establish local processing centres to reduce food waste and boost economic activities in the rural areas. He  believes economic development starts within the community adding that the Federal Government efforts  was a critical part of developing jobs and building a healthy local economy long-term. This is because building a local food industry cluster focused on processing will support entrepreneurship, local jobs, food manufacturing and agriculture. According to him, demand for food is huge and growing and it makes sense to grow and invest in farmers. Oke sought the enhancement of farm incomes by offering a ready market for farm products, generate off-farm employment, and reduce rural–urban migration. Stakeholders complained that rural-based food processing industries  are  mostly  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  face  such  constraints  as  poor infrastructure,  shortage  of  entrepreneurial  talent  and  skilled  manpower,  limited  access  to  appropriate technologies, volatile demand, and small profit margins.
