Global Process and Pipeline Services Limited (GPPSL), a Nigerian company focused solely on process and pipeline services, has acquired three massive flooding pumps with the capacity of 3,150 USG per minute and close to 600 PSI each, together with three massive lifting pump (6,000 USG/Min) each and other connections that go with the equipment spread. “They are high pressure, high volume and no other company can boast of such flooding pumps in West Africa”, chief executive officer of GPPSL, Obi Uzu, told select reporters on the sideline of the just concluded 2019 Nigerian Oil & Gas (NOG) conference and exhibition in Abuja. Nigeria is on the verge of completing the 48-inch pipeline – the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline, and there are also plans for another big pipeline project that will run from Nigeria to North Africa. “Those are massive projects that will need our kind of equipment. Besides there is also requirement for big pipeline services in-country”, Uzu said. GPPSL also acquired six Air Loaders, which include pneumatic suction pumps for cleaning of floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) tanks. The FPSOs will require cleaning according to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) related regulation. “We have gone ahead to make these massive investments to keep the game alive – those clients we have been working for are happy, but we want to make sure that they are happier with the services they are getting today  and in future compared to what they got in the past.” The GPPSL chief said the company is also investing in solid organizational process and sustainable human resources.
