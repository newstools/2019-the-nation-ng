Budding gospel musician, Chukwuemeka Michael Ebuka, who is better known as Michael Olive, has released a new song titled ‘Ebube.’ According to the Ebonyi State born artiste, ‘Ebube’ which was produced by Vice beatmaker, “is a song to show the magnanimity of God grace upon my life  and every other person, it’s a song for thanksgiving and appreciation. It’s been sang in Igbo which is my language and English which is a general language.” On what inspired ‘Ebube,’ Michael Olive: “The song actually came through my prayer time. It’s a song from the Holy Spirit. Pastors see vision during their prayer time but for me I hear sounds, baselines, guitar, keyboard and lyrics.  I have a lot of songs which actually came like that in which I haven’t recorded yet. When this song came to my spirit I picked up my phone recorded it and now it’s in the reality.” Olive who has Ordinary National Diploma (OND) from the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta, Ogun State, further revealed that It feels good to have recorded and released his debut and also to know that he has begun to pursue his dreams in serving God and wining more souls. “I’m looking forward in releasing more songs this year,” he said.
