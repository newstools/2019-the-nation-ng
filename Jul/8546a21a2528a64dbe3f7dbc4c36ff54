As part of her commitment to place Nigeria on the global the fashion and modelling map, Mrs. Joan Okorodudu, founder and CEO of ISIS Models Africa has revealed her plans to set up a branch of the modelling outfit in London, United Kingdom. “We may not become a fashion capital like Milan or Paris, but if Africans take the time to sit down for a minute, we can make a New York out of the Nigerian fashion industry, as there are flourishing companies based here worth billions,” the 54-year-old model agency owner, designer and Boston University alumnus said. Popularly known as ‘the godmother of modelling’ in Nigeria, Okorodudu has pushed new frontiers and has positively propelled young ladies towards success in their modelling career.
