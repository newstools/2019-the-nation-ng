Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) chapter of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) and the Nigerian Civil Service Union (NCSU) have pledged to work with FIRS to realise its N8.8 trillion target for the year. Its Chairman, Okere Samson, and his NCSU counterpart, Idris Hassan, gave the assurance at a meeting with FIRS Chairman, Tunde Fowler. According to Hassan, the FIRS chair has raised the level of staff welfare and unfolded plans that would enable the workers to realise their goals. He added that Fowler also approved meal, children education, and maintenance grants – once the workers met their target and attained some consensus on the vacancies for last year and this year’s promotion. “Apart from the increase of subsistence allowance, staff have also been paid wardrobe allowances, while quarterly bonus on met or exceeded target in revenue collection, 13th month salary, and payment of equity contribution to benefiting staff of the FIRS Mass Housing Scheme have also been approved. “This is to inform FIRS staff that following continuous engagement between Nigeria Civil Service Union (NCSU) and management of the FIRS, the management has been able to address most of the issues raised like increment of subsistence allowance to 30 per cent, reduction of KPI (Key Performance Indicators) benchmark from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of non-oil, and payment of terminal benefits to staff among others,” he  said. On his part, the ASCSN Chairman, Comrade Samson advised the staff to work harder to ensure that the Service realises its revenue target. On proposed staff grants, such as meal subsidies, children’s education and furniture maintenance grants, Samson said the FIRS chairman had directed the Director, Human Capital to   pay grants once the FIRS attains 70 per cent of its non-oil revenue target after the third quarter of the year. He said: “All outstanding severance benefits to retired staff have been approved for payment to staff that exited the service since November 2018, while Fowler directed that more working tools such as printers, laptops, and furniture be provided by directors in charge of facility and efficiency, to ensure timely distribution of such tools to field offices.”
