THE kidnapped Secretary-General of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Anthony Porole, has regained his freedom after almost one week in the kidnappers’ den. It was gathered on Thursday in Port Harcourt that Porole was released in the evening of Wednesday (July 3), but it could not be confirmed if ransom was paid, before he regained his freedom. The secretary-general was kidnapped around 8:30pm on June 28 in his compound at Biara-Ogoni hometown in Gokana Local Government Area of Rivers State, with the criminals shooting sporadically, before escaping with him to an unknown destination. MOSOP, on Thursday in Port Harcourt, through its Publicity Secretary, Sunny Zorvah, stated that members of the umbrella organisation of Ogoni people were glad about Porole’s release unhurt. It said: “We commend all efforts by individuals and the security agencies in the release of the MOSOP’s Secretary-General. We are calling on the leaders of the various communities in Ogoni to secure their territories and purge criminal elements from their kingdoms.
