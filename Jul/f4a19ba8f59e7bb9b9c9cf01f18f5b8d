Some electricity consumers in Lekki, Lagos on Monday accused Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) of negligence. The firm, they claimed, has refused to fix their faulty transformer 7 at Ilasan Jakande Estate, Lekki. There has been power outage in the area for the past four weeks following shortage of transformer oil and damage of feeder panel. Residents have been in darkness. Commercial activities are paralysed. A resident, Mr. Kazeem Sulaiman, appealed to EKEDC head office to intervene, “as the Lekki Business Unit of the firm at Agungi has not responded to our complaints.”
