A Tinubu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Monday sentenced an unemployed man, John Koffi, to four years imprisonment for stabbing a welder with a broken bottle. Magistrate A.M Olumide-Fusika convicted Koffi, 21, following his plea of guilty to a one-count charge of assault occasioning grievous harm. The offence contravened Section 171 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015. Before the sentence, the court heard that Koffi broke into Mr Nsikkan Okon’s workshop with the intent to steal and stabbed him while trying to escape. She held: “I hereby sentence the defendant to four years imprisonment. “The defendant should learn a skill that he so pleases and the prison authorities should keep a close watch on him. Earlier, prosecuting Inspector Ben Ekundayo reviewed the facts of the case. Ekundayo said Koffi, of Mobil Road, Ajah, Lagos, committed the offence at about 3 am on May 20, at Thomas Estate, Ajah. He stated that Okon, a welder, observed that some unknown persons had been entering his workshop and stealing his work tools. “The complainant stood guard in his workshop overnight and saw Koffi scaling the fence into the shop to steal his tools. “When the defendant saw Okon, he attacked him with a broken bottle and stabbed him repeatedly on his right hand and chest,” Ekundayo said.
