The Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the forfeiture of N31.4million and two vehicles seized from a convicted drug dealer Chief Odugwe Azubuike to the Federal Government. Justice Mohammed Liman sentenced him to five- year imprisonment. The National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) charged Azubuike with unlawful importation of 3.150 kilograms of cocaine. He was arraigned in 2010 with the prosecution calling two witnesses and tendering several exhibits. Midway into the trial, Azubuike fled. He was later re-arrested and arraigned for another drug-related offence, for which he was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment. While serving the three-year jail term, he was made to face the previous charge over which he jumped bail. The convict pleaded guilty to the charge. Prosecuting counsel Ichakpa Oigoga told the court that NDLEA recovered N31, 321, 013.55 million and N104,800,00 from the convictâ€™s bank accounts. He added that a Toyota 4Runner and a Toyota Sienna were also recovered from him. The prosecutor said the money and the vehicles were proceeds of illicit drug dealing and should be forfeited. Justice Liman ordered their forfeiture to the Federal Government.
