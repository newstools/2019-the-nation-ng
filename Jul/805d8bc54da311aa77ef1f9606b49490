THE Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has in ducted 46 recently qualified dealing clerks, paving the way for them to begin trading at the Exchange. Out of the 53 candidates who had passed the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS) examination and went through the mandatory practical Automated Trading System (ATS) training at the NSE, 46 passed the final oral examination at the Exchange. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Mr Oscar Onyema said the induction was both a celebration and a call to stand tall in integrity, to be impeccable in character, to be professional in service and to uphold the high ethics and values for which the Exchange and the capital market are renowned. According to him, professionalism and ethical behaviours are the major hurdles that the new dealing clerks must cross effortlessly in their daily practice of their profession. “The NSE has clear and enforceable rules and operates with a zero tolerance policy on all infractions. The NSE will support the inductees in developing their capacity. However, if infractions occur, NSE will not hesitate to wield the axe on any erring member that falls short on any of its rules,” Onyema said. He also advised the new clerks to stay relevant in today’s dynamic environment, emphasizing that continuous training is a tool that should not be underestimated. He noted that the Exchange established X-Academy, to provide education to individuals who wish to improve their understanding of various aspects of the capital market. Doyen of Stockbrokers, Alhaji Rasheed Yussuf, called on the newly inducted dealing clerks to let their words be their bond noting that this would engender confidence and growth of their respective organizations and the capital market at large.
