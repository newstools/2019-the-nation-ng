The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division, Maj.-Gen. Jamil Sarham, has stated that the personnel of the Nigerian Army have Nigerians’ interest at heart. He spoke Wednesday at the Primary Healthcare Centre, Rumuokwurusi-Port Harcourt in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, during the free medical outreach, which was part of the activities to mark this year’s Army Day celebration. Maj. Gen. Sarham, who is also the Land Component Commander of Operation Delta Safe, was represented by the Commander, 6 Division Medical Services and Hospital, Lt. Col. Johnson Ogah, a Consultant Anaesthetist, while the outreach amid heavy rain by a team of medical professionals, had as beneficiaries: many children, youths and the elderly. The GOC said: “The Nigerian Army values the health of people of its host communities, hence the outreach. The programme is in line with the vision of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, to support good health of Nigerians. “One thing the Chief of Army Staff likes doing, as part of the Nigerian Army’s corporate social responsibilities, is the medical outreach, which is part of our military/civil relations with the people. It also gives us an opportunity to reach out to people of the host communities, to render our services and for them to know that we have their interest at heart.” One of the beneficiaries of the well-attended free medical outreach, Chief Nelson Wali, who is also the Vice Chairman, Rumuokwurusi Nvuike Council of Chiefs, lauded the Chief of Army Staff for initiating the outreach and the army medical team for the efforts. Wali disclosed that he was diagnosed and given free drugs for treatment, just like many others. While also speaking, other beneficiaries: Chief Loveday Ihunwo and Mrs. Victoria Gospower pleaded that the medical outreach should be a continuous exercise, for more persons to benefit.
