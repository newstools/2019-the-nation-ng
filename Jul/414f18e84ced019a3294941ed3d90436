The controvesy over the purported invasion of the Ondo state House of Assembly complex by a snake has assumed another dimension as Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu Sunsay ordered the probe of the appearance of the reptile in its hallow chamber. The Governor who expressed dismay on how snake scared at the state parliament, inspected the facilities at the State House of Assembly. He said his government would investigate what brought the snake into the law chamber while the lawmakers were in session. Lawmakers had on Thursday scampered for safety when a snake dropped from the roof and landed on the hallow chamber during the plenary. It led to hasty suspension of proceedings as directed by the speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun. Akeredolu however blamed the lawmakers, alleging blackmail in the such a circumstance. He said his inspection of facilities at the premises of the House did not suggest that snakes could penetrate into the chamber. The Governor alleged that members of the House of Assembly diverted the money earnmarked for maintainance of the facilities in the Assembly complex to other things. Although he admitted that the facilities at the Assembly complex need renovation, the Governor said he could not believe that a live snake could jump from the roof into the chamber. But, the Speaker, Oleyelogun said that the matter was painted more than the actual incidence in the social media. According to him, the House had requested for fund for the total renovation of structures and facilities at the Assemblyâ€™s complex before the incident.
