Two of the world’s biggest car manufacturers are forging an alliance towards developing technologies aimed for the electric and autonomous segments. Both Ford Motors and Volkswagen AG confirmed last Thursday that they are expanding their alliance which was revealed in January. The expansion will cover joint development and collaboration on the development of autonomous and electric vehicles. The two companies said Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess and Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett will both appear at the scheduled press conference. Among the expected agenda is a potential investment by Volkswagen towards Argo AI, the autonomous driving system company in which Ford has a majority stake. Another matter that is expected to be discussed is Volkswagen’s contribution to the collaboration which is rumoured to be valued around $2 billion. Both Volkswagen and Ford declined to comment on the matter. However, a Ford spokesperson did confirm that the two companies are in productive talks regarding a number of areas. As for investments geared towards the development of artificial intelligence and self-driving technologies, Ford has pledged to invest $4 billion into the industry by 2023. Ford established its Ford Autonomous Vehicles division in 2018 for this very reason. It most valuable acquisition to date is when it bought Argo AI, a startup based in Pittsburgh that specialises in the development of software for self-driving cars. The two car companies have been in discussion on how to share the burden when it comes to the development of electric and autonomous cars.
