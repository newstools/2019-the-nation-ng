The reigning Miss Port Harcourt City International, Precious Nnengi Ransome, has announced plans to embark on a pet project which focuses on battling malaria. “I want to create an awareness and help people fight against this deadly sickness,” she said. “Malaria kills nearly one million people every year, hence this campaign is aimed at helping people learn how to prevent malaria, and anti-malaria drugs, nets and creams will be given to people.” The Queen who emerged amidst other contestants in a big ceremony in Port Harcourt, Rivers State also revealed plans to go for an international pageant contest after her reign elapses. “I am planning to go for an International Pageant, and I’m also aiming to have my own organization that will help teach the younger generation the importance of a good menstrual hygiene and circle, hence as a continuation of my project “Pad Up A Girl Child”. Since she emerged last year she said, “ever since I got crowned, i would say my life took a new turn, it has made me a more responsible person, so far it hasn’t been easy but I signed up for this and I’m not quitting because i love the lady I’m growing into every single day. “I want to wake up one day and look back at how far I’ve come and smile because I’m proud of myself, and all this is going to require a lot of hard work. A huge thanks to the Miss Port Harcourt City Organization for giving me a platform to climb higher.” In her reign so far, Queen Precious has visited motherless babies homes and was part of a team that visited senior citizens at Okujagu community on Valentine’s day.
