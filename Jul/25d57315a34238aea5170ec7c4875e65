A member of the House of Representatives (Ibeju-Lekki Federal Constituency), Mr. Adebayo Balogun, has given reasons for the need to build a coastal road from Akodo Ise to Victoria Island, Lagos. In an interview with reporters at the weekend, he said it is evident that the existing road infrastructure in Ibeju Lekki, especially the Lekki axis, cannot accommodate the emerging industrial revolution in the area. He said the existing roads had been damaged. Balogun urged the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to begin the process of completing the whole stretch of the Port Harcourt -Lagos coastal road. The ministry in the interim, should make provisions in the 2020 budget estimates for the construction of a coastal road from Ise in Ibeju Lekki to Victoria Island in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State, he said. Last Thursday, the lawmaker moved a motion titled: “Urgent Need to Construct Lekki Coastal Road from Akodo Ise to Victoria Island, Lagos State. In the motion, he noted that Ibeju Lekki Local Government is located along the coastal line of Lagos State and is probably the fastest growing economic and industrial hub, especially with the establishment of the Lekki Free Trade Zone, which sits on 16,500 hectares. Balogun further said: “Dangote Oil Refinery, which is the largest in Africa with its conglomerates such as a fertiliser plant, a petrochemical plant and a sub -sea gas pipeline project, is expected to begin operations at the local government in less than two years. “With a daily production of 650,000 barrels per day, it will transform the Nigerian economy from a net importer of refined petroleum products to a net exporter of petroleum products.”
