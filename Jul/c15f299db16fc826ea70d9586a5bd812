THE Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC) has recovered multi million naira equipment from a private residence in Akwa Ibom State. The equipment, allegedly meant for a cottage hospital in Essien Udim Local Government Area, include one dialysis machine, two 15 KVA generators, an infant incubator and others. ICPC Commissioner Shola Shodipo, who led reporters to recover the items, said: “ICPC is interested in constituency projects and has set up tracking groups in 12 states. In the course of our assignment, we discovered that the equipment – three dialysis machines and others – meant for the Ukana Cottage hospital, were not delivered. We found only one in a private place which was not delivered or put in place in the hospital. “These machines and other equipment were meant to be delivered since 2018. We have taken the equipment to the appropriate location. The equipment are supposed to help the community in healthcare. “We are still investigating. I will not be able to tell for now, but I can tell you that the equipment were meant for the Cottage Hospital and a particular company was awarded the contract.” The hospital consultant, Dr. Mary Udoh, who received the equipment, thanked ICPC for ensuring that the equipment were delivered to the hospital. She said the equipment would facilitate healthcare delivery to the communities. “On behalf of the hospital management, I want to say we are very happy receiving the equipment today. I thank the ICPC for ensuring that these equipment were delivered to the right place. The equipment will help us in our service delivery to the people,” she added.
