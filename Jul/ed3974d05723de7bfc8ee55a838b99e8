Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Company (NERC) should sanction erring power distribution companies (DisCos) to keep them on their toes, a group, Change Partners International, has said. Its Founder, Mr Akachukwu Okafor, said the advice is relevant now that the Federal Government and Siemens Incorporation have held talks on how scale up power generation by 11,000 megawatts (Mw) of electricity. In an interview with The Nation on phone, Okafor said many of the 11 DisCos have committed grievous offences in the past and went scot free, adding that any attempts to spare those firms again would affect the image of the industry. Okafor said: “Siemens is a world-class firm, with competence in generation and technologies. The company has the capacity to deal with issues we have with the grid in Nigeria. The contracts with Siemiens would strengthening the grid infrastructure, transmission lines and distribution networks in Nigeria. This is the reason the power distribution firms must be penalised in order to enable them do the tight thing.” According to him, the contract between the Federal Government and Siemens would help in boosting the the power sector. The government, Okafor said, must try and meet its obligations in order to ensure the success of the deal, adding that the German government has also put in place measures in order to ensure that the contract is delivered at the right time. He commended the Federal Government for partnering Siemens, stressing that the initiative is the best since President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office five years ago. He said: “The synergy between the Federal Government and Siemens to improve electricity in Nigeria is a good one. It is commendable as it is the best since Mr President assumed office about five years ago.”
