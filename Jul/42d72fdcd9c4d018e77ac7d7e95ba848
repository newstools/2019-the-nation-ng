Lagos Sexual and Domestic Offences Court, Ikeja has fixed judgment for October 18 in the charge of alleged defilement of a two-year-old pupil brought against a supervisor of Chrisland International School, Lekki, Mr Adegboyega Adenekan. Justice Sybil Nwaka fixed the date for judgement during resumed proceedings in the matter. Justice Nwaka also refused the bail application filed by Adenekan, who was sent back on remand to Kirikiri Prisons two weeks ago by the court. Ruling on the bail application filed by his counsel, Mr Olatunde Adejuyigbe (SAN), the trial judge said she was being mindful of the safety of the defendant. “I am mindful of the accused protection and therefore adjourned the case to October 2 for submission of final written address.” Earlier during the proceedings on Wednesday, the prosecuting counsel, Mr. B.T Boye told the court that there are factors to be considered before granting bail to any defendant. Boye listed the factors to include “the nature of offence, character of evidence, the criminal record of the defendant, likelihood of repetition if granted bail,  guilt on the defendant side and detention for the protection of the defendant.” It would be recalled that, at the last proceedings, the court revoke the bail granted by a magistrate court to the defendant which he has been enjoying since the commencement of trial in 2017 as the court was not provided with the conditions attached to it. Adenekan is being prosecuted by the Lagos State Government for defiling a two-year-old former pupil in the nursery section of the school. He had pleaded not guilty.
