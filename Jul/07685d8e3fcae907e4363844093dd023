It said the nomination was not only well-deserved but also one that will move the state forward. The group also applauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for not giving the slot to former Governor Abiola Ajimobi. In a statement by chairman and Publicity Secretary of Oyo APC Reformers, Hon Lawrence Adewale and Engr. Dipo Fawole, the forum promised to support, cooperate and work with the minister-designate. It said it will put appropriate measure in place to reorganise and strengthen the party in the state for future elections. The Reformers applauded the decision of Oke Ogun Unity Forum leaders for returning to the APC after the end of the “jackboot dictator”. It said since the “Constituted Authority” has lost his final battle and the federal government has aligned with the people of Oyo state, it is time to start forming alliance with other leaders and groups like Oke Ogun Unity Forum to start reconciliation, reformation, rebuilding and redevelopment of the party. While appreciating the success of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s leadership and reconciliatory efforts in Ondo state, the group pleaded with the Asiwaju team to pay a similar visit to Oyo state and investigate the group’s persistence call for the dissolution of the indolent party executive in the state
