To mark her birthday, radio talk show host, Agnes Madakor, has paid special tribute to late Precious Owolabi, a corps member who died after sustaining gunshots while covering Shiites’ violent protest for Channels Television in Abuja last Monday. Madakor, who was anchor for the just concluded Nigeria’s prestigious regional award, South Achievers Award and currently being shortlisted for Versace Africa, as part of her 26th birthday offered prayers for the repose of the fallen corps member at the Catholic Church of Epiphany-Lagos, last Thursday, even as she described the incident as unfortunate. “That incident is sad,” Madakor said. “God alone knows… it’s in my heart.” Born in Douala Cameroon to a Cross River mom and an Anambra father, Madakor earned the name ‘Amaka your beauty on radio’ being one of the popular voices of ‘voice our culture’ airing on Voice of Nigeria, Radio Nigeria in 2011; and ‘campus life’ on Kapital F.M 92.9. Madakor has also appeared on billboards for brands such as House of Tara International, Belle Femme Signature and many others. The On-Air-Personality, face model, scriptwriter, songbird and voice over artist currently hones her skills as presenter with Tell Africa Media as she prepares to debut her continental talk show tagged ‘Talk to Agnes.’
