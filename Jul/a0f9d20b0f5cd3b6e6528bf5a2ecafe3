Watch this space. “A true Thespian generates his art from within. He doesn’t force it. To him/her, its as natural as breathing. It’s one of the secret recipes God used in creating him/her. It’s carefully embedded in his/her DNA. That is talent but with it must come Training, for only then can it become a Profession.”
