Justice J.A Orjiako-led Rivers State Governorship election Petition Tribunal sitting has adjourned till August 1, 2019 for continuation of evidence by 2nd respondent Governor Nyesom Wike) witnesses. Three witnesses have already testified from the second respondent’s list of witnesses. The trio is collation agents for Port Harcourt City, Andoni and Oyibo Local Government Areas of the state. Each told the three-man panelists that election was held in their respective LGAs on March 9 peacefully. They added results were securely collated and announced in their presence by the officials the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Those who have appeared before the panel to speak in favour of the Governor are a former commissioner during Wike’s first tenure, Chinyere Igwe,(Port Harcourt City LGA), Samuel Gilbert(Andoni) and Jackson Nweke (Oyigbo). The Action Democratic Party(ADP), state governorship candidate at the election, Victor Fingesi is challenging the victory of Governor Nyesom Wike at the polls, using INEC’s March 15 statement the election in the state was marred by violence and disruption, which led to the suspension of collation of election results, as grounds for his petition. Fingesi is seeking the cancellation of the election bases; and insisting that a fresh election be conducted. But the PDP agents on Saturday said the exercise was smooth and hitch free and not disrupted at all. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the sitting, the ADP Lawyer, Dolapo Tella Attoni expressed optimism the petition will be upheld at the end of the day and the state governorship election cancelled. He stated his hope is predicated on the grounds of the petition and the provision of the law, in the event of viol nice and electoral malpractice in elections. Efforts to speak with other lawyers in the matter failed as they declined comments.
