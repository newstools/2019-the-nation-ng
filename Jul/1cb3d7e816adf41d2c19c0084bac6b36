The Publicity Secretary of the Nutritional Society of Nigeria, Olusola Malomo, has urged Nigerians, especially  religious adherents to explore the nutritional and health benefits of 100 per cent  fruit juice to recover lost nutrients after a long period of fasting. Malomo gave the advice in the first series of his engagement in the health  and nutritional  benefits of 100 per cent  fruit juice, a monthly educative  programme  sponsored by Chi Limited, the parent company of Chivita, as part of its ‘no-added sugar’ campaign. According to the sponsor, the engagement, which kicked off last year,  aimed at sharing unbiased information on the benefits of 100 per cent fruit juice and support independent efforts by experts such as scientists, nutritionists and dieticians to show how 100 per cent fruit juice contributes to the health and well-being of consumers. In the series titled: ‘100 per cent Fruit Juice: A Healthy Way to Revitalise after Fasting,’  Malomo said fasting helps to relieve human system,  adjust fat    level, streng-then the digestive system and increase its efficiency. He, however, regretted that many people lose the health benefits of the spiritual exercise when they take to junk food shortly after. ”They break their fast with lavish, sweet and oily feasts. This increases cholesterol level and, perhaps, triggers diabetes. A few individuals, on the other hand, overstrain their systems, leading to deficiency of vital nutrients.
