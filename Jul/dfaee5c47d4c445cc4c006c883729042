The Chairman, Benue  Internal Revenue Service (BIRS),  Mr. Andrew Ayabam has ordered that all tax consultants with the Service must be tax compliant within seven days. Ayabam who frowned at the situation where tax administrators are not tax compliant also warned against forging tax clearance certificates. He said anybody caught will be handed over to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for prosecution. The chairman who spoke at the meeting convened with consultants at the corporate headquarters of the service in Makurdi, the state capital, warned all consultants against payment of tax into personal or company accounts. He said all tax payments must be made directly into the state government accounts for easy accountability and assured that the consultants will be paid their agreed percentages every first week of the month. Ayabam also instructed all tax consultants who are yet to do their full remittance, to pay up before July 23, 2019 or face termination.
