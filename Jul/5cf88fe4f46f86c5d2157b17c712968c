The police in Ogun have arrested three persons for allergy killing a couple on June 30. James Olaosebikan, 72, and his wife Esther, 68, were murdered in cold blood at their Sagamu residence.
Their killings, according to the police, entered their residence through the ceiling and butchered them to death. The suspects, Ibrahim Uthman, Aba Abdulkareem and Abdulhamid Ibrahim were arrested on July 12 and they confessed to have killed the couple after they recognised one of four armed men who invaded their home to rob them. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP) said the incident was reported by the couple’s son, Joseph Olaosebikan. He said: “Upon the report, the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama ordered the DPO Sagamu Division, SP Okiki Agunbiade to fish out the killers within the shortest possible time. The DPO and his men embarked on technical and forensic investigation of the case and their efforts yielded positive result with the arrest of three members of the gang. “They confessed being a robbery gang and that one of their member who is now at large invited them for the purpose of robbing old couple and a nearby shop. “But on getting to the house, they discovered that the couple recognised one of them, hence they matcheted them to death. “CP Bashir Makama has ordered the homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) to take over the case for proper investigation. He also directed that the fleeing member of the gang must be brought to book within the shortest possible time,” said Oyeyemi.
