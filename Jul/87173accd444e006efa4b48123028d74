Suspected assailants on Tuesday night besieged the Erinjiyan-Ekiti residence of a former deputy speaker of Ekiti House of Assembly, Hon. Olusegun Adewumi in Ekiti West Local Government Area. The bandits, who forced their way into the residence around 2am, didn’t meet Adewumi who reportedly travelled to Canada with his family. It would be recalled some bandits had on March 30, 2013 attacked the former deputy speaker’s residence in Erinjiyan where his mother, Mrs. Juliana Adewumi and aides Mr. Ayo Jeje aka Murphy were murdered. The gardener in charge of the residence, who was not around when the incident happened, said the assailants who infiltrated into the house were after the former speaker because no property were carted away. He explained it was when the hoodlums had left the people inside called to notify him of the incident. He said: “I was in Aramoko when I received a call from someone living close to Honourable ‘s house that I should come at dawn to Erinjiyan. “Not quite long, I received other calls from two different people, who were known to me. And I rushed down to Erinjiyan at dawn to check. When I got there, I could see traces of the entry, but no property was carted away. “They were said to be fully armed, asking about the honourable. They were quoted to have  said “the stupid guy is not in Ado and still  nowhere to be in his hometown, Erijiyan.” He added the bandits invaded Adewumi’s residence in Ado Ekiti few months ago, saying this will be the third time the former lawmaker would be attacked since the gruesome killing of his mother. When contacted the Ekiti Police Command Spokesman, Caleb Ikechukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police said the command has not been briefed of the incident.
