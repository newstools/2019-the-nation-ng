The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condoled with family of Mr Precious Owolabi, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member attached to Channels Television who was killed in Abuja during a clash between Shiites and police. The party in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Tuesday in Abuja, said it was saddened by the death of Owolabi, DCP Usman Umar and other Nigerians. Owolabi, 23 years, was shot dead during the Monday clash between police and Shiite protesters in Abuja. Ologbondiyan condemned the continuous killing of Nigerians in avoidable clashes in various parts of the country, particularly the preventable skirmishes between the police and the Monday protesters. “Indeed, our hearts reach out to his family at this moment of grief. “The killing of Owolabi, as well as the avoidable deaths of other compatriots, including a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is indeed another sad commentary on the irreplaceable losses and anguish families in Nigeria’’. Ologbondiyan called on the National Assembly to immediately take urgent legislative steps to unravel how the Monday protest led to the death of yet to be ascertained number of Nigerians. He also advised President Muhammadu Buhari to take immediate steps that would put to an end the violence ravaging in the country as well ensure a stable, united, equitable and secured Nigeria. “Certainly, no nation can thrive under an atmosphere of persistent violence, bloodletting and siege mentality on the citizenry’’. Ologbondiyan also call for an end to all anti-people tendencies, noxious body language and all acts that promote impunity and lawlessness in Nigeria. (NAN)
