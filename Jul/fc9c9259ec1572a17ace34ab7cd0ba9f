The Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) plans to make the Employment Compensation Scheme (ECA), attractive to employers. Speaking at the Fidau prayer for the late president of Nigeria Employers’Consultative Association (NECA), Dr. Muhammad Jimoh Yinusa,  NSITF Chairman, Austin Enejamo-Isire, said the fund was set to propagate the benefits of the scheme to employers, noting that such  campaigns would make employers key into the scheme. He said: “It is our plan to enhance the vision of NSITF, which would ensure deliverance and what is our vision, to be the leading social security institution in Africa as well as build the economy of our country. “We have a deliberate action on safety net and it is our main target to ensure that workers are well protected in the workplaces and should there be any accident that they are well compensated. “Employers who are under the scheme are better off than those who are not, this is because, in case of accident during the course of work, they pay nothing to take care of their employee, short of the mandatory 1 per cent contribution.” Enejamo-Isire reiterated the need to make employers aware of the advantage of enrolling their workers in the scheme. According to him, awareness was key to the success of the scheme, adding that the Federal Government was doing a lot for Nigerians in social investments to provide a fair deal for all citizens. He said: “I have just resumed as the chairman of the NSITF board and I believe that one way to increase enrolment is to create awareness and I do know that if you do great things and you fail to propagate those things, nobody will recognise that.’’
