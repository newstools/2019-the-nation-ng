The igando/Ikotun local council development area has joined others in Lagos state to celebrate the 2019 tree- planting Day across the State. A small gathering of representative of the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, attended the exercise witnessed by executive chairman Igando/Ikotun LCDA, Chief Mrs. Morenike Williams and other notable personalities. Sanwo-Olu’s representative Mr Abiodun Bamgboye noted it was of high importance that residents plant trees in their environment to preserve lives by giving back oxygen. “We can never over stress the importance of tree planting in our lives.Trees are essential to eco-systems in which they reside. As they control climate by moderating the effects of sun, rain and wind, they also absorb and store rainwater which prevents the transport of chemicals into drinkable water” he said. “They are on important part of every community and good neighbours to lovers of nature. Aside from creating a peaceful and aesthetically pleasing environment, they improve the quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban settings,” the governor stated. Williams warned it is an offence to cut trees in Lagos, noting  anybody caught in the act would be dealt with by the necessary agents in charge. “We all know the importance of tree planting and we’ve already educated our people both the literate and illiterate on why they shouldn’t cut the trees. “The trees give us oxygen while we breath out  carbon dioxide. We also frown at cooking with trees because it is very dangerous to the health,” she noted.
