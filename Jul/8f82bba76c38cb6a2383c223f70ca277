TWO persons were feared dead at the weekend in renewed hostilities between Usumtong and Ebom communities in Abi Local Government Area of Cross River State. The head of Ebom village, Chief Sunday Obite, alleged yesterday that a man and his son were beheaded by people from Usumtong, who ambushed them while they were on their farm last Saturday. It was gathered that the man, Mr. Oti Ato, who was killed with his son, Sunday, was also with his grandson, Michael, who escaped with gunshot injuries, and other members of his family. Obite said three persons are missing, adding that the headless bodies of the victims had been recovered with the help of soldiers deployed in the communities since the crisis started last year. He said: “The man and his family were harvesting cassava when they were attacked by Usumutong people. The grandson, who is receiving treatment in a hospital at Itigidi following the bullet wound he sustained while hiding in the bush, said he saw the people cutting off his grandfather’s and father’s heads from his hiding place in the bush. “They even made the wife, Eliza Oti, watch while they beheaded her husband and son and asked her to inform her family. “We thought since the soldiers were present, peace had been restored. But we have been proved wrong. Even as they stole our produce, we kept mute. But now they have started again by killing a man and his son in the presence of his wife.” Another member of Ebom community, Oban Bassey, said they retrieved the bodies with the help of soldiers and reported the matter to the police. Police spokesperson Irene Ugbo said: “We are aware of the killing. The commissioner of police has deployed men there. Community leaders have been invited to meet the commissioner for further deliberation. At present the area is calm.”
