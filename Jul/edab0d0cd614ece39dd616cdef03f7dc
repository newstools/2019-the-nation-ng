The Ebonyi State Police Command has arrested one Mrs. Nkechinyere Aja for alleged abuse and harm occasioned on the right eye of her house help, Chinonyerem Chiude. The Police Spokesperson, DSP Loveth Odah, described the incident as child abuse and labour, an offence punishable under the law. Odah said the alleged perpetrator, who is a staff of Mile Four Hospital in Abakaliki, had injured the victim on her right eye while flogging her for using detergent to wash household utensils instead of soap. The police spokesperson said the culprit, Aja, who admitted committing the act, was later released to commence treatment on the victim. Chiude, the victim, who is a Primary four pupil in New Era International School, Abakaliki, told newsmen that her mistress, Mrs. Aja, inflicted the injury on her right eye while flogging her, adding that she was instructed by her mistress not to disclose the real cause of her injury. “My aunt got annoyed immediately I told her I used detergent instead of bar soap to wash plates, she flogged me with cane until she injured my right eye,” she said. Mrs. Dorothy Magbo, Proprietress of the New Era International School, Abakaliki, said she reported the matter to the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development after the victim’s mistress refused to honour several invitations made to her. “I noticed Chiude was emotionally down and when I approached her, Chiude said she sustained the injury when her aunt beat her for using detergent to wash plates instead of soap,” she said. Mr. Godwin Igwe, Head of Department, Child Development of the ministry, expressed dismay over the incident describing it as ‘inhumanity’ to life.
