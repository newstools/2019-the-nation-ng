More aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have joined Bayelsa and Kogi states’ governorship race. They obtained their nomination documents yesterday at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. For Bayelsa State, Fred Agbedi and Reuben Okoya obtained their expression of interest and nomination forms for N21 million each. For Kogi State was Mrs Grace Adejoh, who only paid the mandatory N1 million fee for expression of interest, as the N20 million nomination form is free for women aspirants. All the three aspirants promised to improve the economies of their states and develop infrastructure, with emphasis on job creation and youth empowerment. At separate interactions with reporters, the aspirants bemoaned the security situation in the states and pledged to put in place the necessary mechanisms to ensure improved security of life and property. Agbedi promised to end militancy and crude oil theft in Bayelsa State by building modular refineries and proving the right environment for industrialisation, if elected. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed November 16 for the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.
