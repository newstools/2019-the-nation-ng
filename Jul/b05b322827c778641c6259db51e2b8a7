Sub-Saharan Africa’s number one business brand, CNBC Africa, has announced the launch of Nazanin Alakija’s the Social Accelerator for a Green Economy (S.A.G.E) Innovation Centre to combat climate change and other environmental issues in Nigeria. The S.A.G.E Innovation Centre is a ground-breaking accelerator with a unique focus on developing SME ventures and entrepreneurs in developing countries ‘Green Economy.’ The centre is expected to build resilience to climate change by enacting programmes that would implement best practices for a healthy environment, thereby empowering social entrepreneurs across Nigeria and Africa. Nigeria is considered 58th most vulnerable and the 22nd least ready nation to adapt to the threats of climate change. Vulnerabilities include exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. An estimated 25 per cent of Nigerians live in the exposed coastal region – a hub for economic activity and source of 90 per cent of foreign income. The S.A.G.E Innovation Centre Founder Nazanin Alakija said there is a critical need for attention to be paid towards climate change, especially in continents or regions plagued by poverty. “I believe that climate change is the greatest threat and defining issue of our time, which has led to hazard and degradation, thereby posing great threats to lives and property globally. “So, S.A.G.E Innovation Centre is borne out of my vision to help combat the effects of climate change upon us and ensure we win the war against environmental pollution of all sorts,” she said.
