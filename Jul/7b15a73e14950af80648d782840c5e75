The Buhari Support Organization in the South West has described the victory of the Osun State governor, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola, at the Supreme Court as a testimonial of the doggedness and tenacity of the people of the state to pursue the progressive agenda. At a press briefing in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, the Coordinator of the group in the South West, Prince Felix Awofisayo, said the apex court’s verdict, which affirmed Oyetola as winner of the Osun State September 22, 2018 governorship election, is also an endorsement of the expression of wishes of the Osun voters during the exercise. Congratulating Oyetola and his deputy, Gboyega Alabi, for the victory, he said he is “now going to leave behind him all distractions and would be able to use his God-giving administrative talents and managerial sagacity to ensure life more abundant for all Osun residents.” He said: “The victory for our state will be an invigorating advancement and consolidation of the progressive tendency. The next level echoes what Gboyega Oyetola and the Buhari Support Organization in the South West stand for. This is that the government policies must be in overriding interest of the majority and not just a privileged few. “This is why we emphasise social intervention programmes as the key trajectory of overall government social and economic policies. So, we are confident that under the seasoned navigation of Governor Gboyega Oyetola in consonance with the Buhari’s Next Level agenda, Osun is on the path of progress.”
