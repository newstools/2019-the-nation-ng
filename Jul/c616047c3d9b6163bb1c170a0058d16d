La Mode Magazine and La Mode Disability Foundation have announced the fifth edition of its annual event to create awareness, appreciate and support persons living with disabilities. The Green October event with the theme ‘Disability Inclusion’, takes place on Nigeria’s Independence Day, October 1, at the Oriental Hotel, Lekki, Lagos. According to the organisers, one of the aims of the edition is to advocate for inclusion of person with disabilities. “We have to include them in our activities, in our forums, fashion shows, business and corporate firms should see the need to include these persons in their various places or positions” said CEO, La Mode Magazine, Sandra Odige. “Some of them are doing very well because we do free training for person with disabilities. If they are well trained i am sure they will add value to whichever organizations they are in. We are trying to encourage them so they can leave their depressed state. They are beautiful, they are good, and all they need is opportunity and inclusion.” Odige however, called on well-meaning Nigerian to support the cause which has been on since 2015 via sponsorship. “We are consistent and focus, we will keep doing it. Where it would lead us, we don’t know but we know that we are doing the right thing and people who feel they can be part of this can contact us via our social media and they won’t regret it. It’s not about money but about the value that we add for humanity.” Actress Tana Adelana who was at the press briefing urged persons living with disability to speak to people who find the good in them and not who make them feel depressed.
