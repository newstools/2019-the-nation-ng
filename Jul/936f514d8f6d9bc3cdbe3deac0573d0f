An Ibadan-based trader, Bushira Salawudeen, has prayed a Mapo Customary Court to plead with her husband, Rafiu, to forgive her and stop the divorce proceedings. Salawudeen, in her short statement before Alhaji Suleiman Apanpa, the President of the court,
admitted that that she threatens to attacks her husband with broken bottles during arguments to silence him.
“I can’t tell you what usually comes over me. I just know that I do attack Rafiu with broken bottles. “Please, help me beg him, I will not repeat it again,” she begged the court. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Rafiu had told the court to put an end to the 23-year-old union between him and his wife on grounds of threat to life, lack of love and nagging attitude. “For over three years now, she has threatened my life. She breaks bottles and threatens to stab me with it. “I can’t allow her into my house again,” he told the court. Corroborating the plaintiff’s submission, Rafiu’s sister prayed the court to dissolve the union without any further waste of time. “My lord, I have spoken to her to drop her arrogance and act of hooliganism, but her heart is made of stone. Delivering his ruling, Justice Apanpa noted that the court does not tolerate any act that could bring about bloodshed. Apanpa dissolved the marriage and awarded custody of two children to Rafi’u and the one to Salawudeen. “Rafiu shall pay N5,000 as the child’s monthly feeding allowance in addition to being responsible for his education and welfare. “Rafiul shall also pay N5,000 to Bushira to enable her mover her property,” theaArbitrator ordered.
