THE Department Of Petroleum Resources (DPR) on Thursday sealed two Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) stations in Lagos safety reasons. The first was Petrocam in Ayobo, Alimosho Local Goverment Area of Lagos. It was totally sealed by DPR officials for allegedly operating without approval; operating in a residential area, and in a building under direct high tension cable. The downstream oil sector regulator also partially sealed  Gasland Nig Ltd for allegedly operating under a risky and unsafe condition. Head, Gas Section, DPR Lagos Zonal Office, Williams Ateukudoh who led the team during the clampdown said the exercise was part of Department’s routine inspections to forestall fire outbreak, and general compliance to safety standards in the domestic service stations. He said through the inspection and surveillance routine on gas stations, DPR has been able to stop illegal operators to the detriment of the general public. He said: “Today, we are on surveillance inspection of gas facilities and what we have seen is very very unsafe. We realised that Petrocam is an illegal entity. The site is unsuitable for operation, so we effect the closure. “We had sealed it off some five months ago but in violation of DPR mandate, they  continued to operate, so we effect another closure to ensure this time they cease to operate. “At Gasland, the operation is very unsafe; we shut it down because safety has been thrown overboard. And it was not like that when we licensed them.” Head, Corporate Service, George Ene-ita who was part of the team, appealed to  members of the public to always furnish DPR with useful information on suspicious illegal operators and those that have thrown safety and precautionary measures to the wind. “We want to appeal to the public to help ensure that proper and standard procedures are in place and adhere to by reacting out to us when stations default. We have a dedicated line for this and the DPR website is also there,” he said.
