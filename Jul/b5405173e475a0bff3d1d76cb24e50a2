A woman identified as Mama Maria has been found beheaded by a man described as her lover at  Owode, Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State. The incident happened penultimate Monday, after the unnamed man had sex  with the deceased. Sources said the single mother  was a popular foodstuff seller at the Ilaro Market. She had invited the man to pass the night at her residence when a misunderstanding broke out between them shortly after they had sex. The man was said to have strangled the single mother to death and proceeded to behead her. He soon fled the scene. Curious neighbours who noticed that the woman had not emerged from her  out by 10 am raised the alarm on sighting blood spilling from under the door to her room. They forced the door open and found her  in a pool of her blood with her head cut off. The police were said to have evacuated the body from the scene. A source said: “It was shocking to us because we saw the woman when she returned home with the man that killed her the previous night. “We later noticed they had an altercation but their voices simmered and we thought that all was well between them not knowing that she had been killed. “It was when she did not come early enough which was unusual that made neighbours to visit her room. “They had to force  the door open after seeing blood on the doorstep. We found her headless in a pool of her blood while her boyfriend had disappeared into the thin air.’’ Police spokesman, Mr Abimbola Oyeyemi said the culprit had been arrested.
