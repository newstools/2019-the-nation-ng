Former Kyrgyz President, Almazbek Atambayev, was on Tuesday summoned for interrogation by the Ministry of the Interior, local media reports. The 62-year-old former president was deprived of legal immunity after a parliament vote on June 27. A special commission formed by the parliament suggested earlier that Atambayev was involved in six crimes during his presidency. Atambayev called the accusations against him “absurd,’’ saying that he was clean and ready to answer all the accusations. He served as president of Kyrgyzstan from December 2011 to November 2017.
