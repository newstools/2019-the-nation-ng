The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) has suspended sitting till Tuesday for lawyer to President Muhammadu Buhari to play video recordings where Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC), Prof Mahmoud Yakubu ruled out the adoption of electronic transmission of result of the last general elections. The tribunal adjourned shortly after Buhari’s lawyer,Alex Izinyon (SAN) applied to be allowed to bring his equipment to play a video Compact Disc (CD) which, he said, contains an interview recording of the INEC Chairman, saying electronic transmission of results was no Longer possible. Izinyon’s application was informed by the objection raised by petitioners’ lawyer, Chris Uche (SAN) to the use of the CD player and television set (brought by the petitioners) to play the CD. Earlier, Uche had, through the petitioners’ witness on Monday – Segun Showunmi – played some video clips where Yakubu and an INEC official, Mike Igini spoke about the possible deployment of electronic transmission of the elections results, using a central server. While being cross-examined by Izinyon, Showunmi said he was aware of an interview granted on February 6, 2019 where Yakubu said electronic transmission of results was no longer possible. Izinnyon then reached for a file on the table in front of him and brought out a CD, which he said contained the interview of February 6, 2019. He indicated his intention to have the CD played to the hearing of all, including the witness, a gesture Uche objected to, insisting the Izinyon should provide his own equipment to play his CD. “My lord, this are our equipment, pointing to the flat screen television and CD player. We brought them to play our CDs. They should bring their own. “In digital world, there is what they call virus, that may affect our gadgets if the CD is played on it,”Uche said, following which Izinyon sought an adjournment till the next day to enable him fetch his own equipment.
