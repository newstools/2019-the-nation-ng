A Nigerian doctor with the Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board (LSMPWB), Dr Abideen Aro, has helped to revive a slumped pilgrim at the Masjid Haram/Nabawi in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. The incident occurred after Solatul Maghrib, the early evening prayer, about 7 a.m. The pilgrim is not from Nigeria. The Nation sighted officials of the Saudi Arabia Red Crescent Authority, also called emergency responders, attending to the pilgrim, who apparently slumped due to exhaustion. About five of the emergency responders battled in vain to revive the victim. Their colleagues chased away other pilgrims, who wanted to see what was going on. “Hajji! Hajji!! Go!!!” Two of the responders were shouting, urging the pilgrims not to stay there. Like others, Dr Aro arrived at the scene and introduced himself as a doctor to the agitated responders. He was allowed access to the slumped pilgrim. The doctor collected some medical instruments, including the one used to check the pilgrim’s heart. After some intervention, the pilgrim opened his eyes and responded to further first aid treatment. He was quickly put on an emergency vehicle and driven to hospital for further treatment. The emergency responders thanked Dr Aro for his “miraculous” help. According to Dr Aro, an official of Lagos State Accident and Trauma Centre, the pilgrim was dehydrated. He blamed the high temperature in Saudi Arabia. Dr Aro, who was formerly with the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), said the pilgrim needed to be placed on drip to get his energy back.
