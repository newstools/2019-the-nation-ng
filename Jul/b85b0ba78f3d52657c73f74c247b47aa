Everton is reportedly considering selling Nigerian talent
Henry Onyekuru this summer as he once again, failed to receive a work permit. It was reported last week that the forward had been denied a
work permit for the third summer in a row. Now, Turkish reports suggests Everton may be considering
selling the player. Fotomac reports that Everton has decided to sell the
player. The Nigerian spent last season on loan at Galatasaray and the Turkish
side is open to bringing him in, either on loan or permanently. Onyekuru, who got married over the weekend, was signed by
Everton in 2017. He joined from KAS Eupen in a deal reported by the BBC to be
in the region of £7 million. However, he was immediately farmed out to
Anderlecht as he did not yet have a work permit. After injury ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup,
Everton again struggled to get clearance for the player and loaned him to
Turkey. Onyekuru had a great season in Istanbul. He scored 16 goals
for the club, including the goal that won them the league. However, he failed to make an impact with Nigeria at this
summer’s African Cup of Nations, leaving Everton short in their hopes of
another work permit application. It will be a shame if Everton never gets the chance to field
Onyekuru in a competitive fixture. But it is starting to look as if their
gamble on his international clearance may not pay off.
