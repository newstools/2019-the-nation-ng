The National President of Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Hajiya Saratu Iya Aliyu, is excited by the President’s signing of the AfCFTA. Hajiya Aliyu said the signing of the treaty by the President was a courageous decision and a fullfilment of the will of Nigerians after a rigorous consultative process involving all stakeholders across the country. In a statement by the organisation’s Director-General, Amb. Ayo Olukanni, Hajiya Aliyu said now the hard work must begin if Nigeria, especially the private sector is to reap the benefits of the Agreement. She said close attention must be paid to the operational phase which has commenced, especially the rules of origin, the Pan African digital payment platform, Web-based and mobile applications for business, and an African Trade Observatory Portal. She advised that that the Organised private sector must work closely together to enable the private businesses and manufacturers harness the potentials of the Agreement. She said NACCIMA was already putting finishing touches to arrangements for seminars, workshops and Advocacy programmes to enable Chambers to key into and take advantage of the opportunities under the Agreement which is expected to create a huge continental trading place on the African continent
