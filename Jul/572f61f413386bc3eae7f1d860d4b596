Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) are required to open a collection account with Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs) of their choice for the receipt of contributions from micro pension participants, a report by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) has shown. The report, titled: “2019 PenCom First Quarter Report”, stated that the collection and management of the Micro Pension Fund will soon commence and PFAS are required to open the collection account. During the quarter under review, the Commission worked on the development of the Micro Pension Plan (MPP) returns rendition template for operators in line with the guidelines for the plan. According to the Commission, the returns would be used to monitor MPP operations, ensure the provision of efficient service delivery to contributors and take action against violations of the guidelines whenever they arise. In the same vein, the Commission said it is in the process of issuing a fee structure to govern the management of the Micro Pension Fund by pension fund operators. This is in light of the commencement of registration of contributors under the MPP and the subsequent collection of contributions from Micro Pension Contributors, the commission added. The report read: “The Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2014 expanded coverage of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) to the self-employed and persons working in organisations with less than 3 employees. This category of workers constitutes the larger percentage of the working population in the country. In order to achieve the pension industry’s strategic objective of covering 30 per cent of the working population in Nigeria under the CPS by the end of 2024, the MPP is being given impetus as an initiative that would ensure the coverage of this important segment of the economy.
