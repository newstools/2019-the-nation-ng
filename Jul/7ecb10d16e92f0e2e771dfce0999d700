Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged manufacturers to develop alternatives to plastic bottles and other non-degradable items, which are threatening the environment. Sanwo-Olu made the call at an environment forum in Lagos, with the theme ‘’The earth, our business, our future’’. The governor, represented by his deputy, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, lamented that plastic waste constituted over 70 per cent of items polluting water bodies and blocking drains, with the devastating flooding. “Our administration is ready to collaborate with the private sector whose activities impact more on the environment to seek innovative ways of carrying on their activities without jeopardising people’s lives and the sustainability of the planet. “These organisations must consider investing in new environmentally friendly technologies, especially in the areas of renewable energy, waste recycling, emissions and packaging. “For instance, plastic waste constitutes a major challenge to the environment, polluting our water bodies and blocking our drainage.” “We owe it as a responsibility to our future to promote policies, strategies and business models that will ensure the sustenance of an environment that will continue to provide support for our lives, our businesses and the future of humanity,” Sanwo-Olu said. Pan African Capital Holdings Chairman Mr Dolapo Atekoja said  the forum was to share ideas and proffer solutions to the menace of environment degradation driven by consumerism. ‘’As, a company, we   are    convinced that   issues   of   climate   change and environmental   sustainability  should   be   on   the   front banner. That  is why we  have been a leading voice, both internationally and locally, in promoting this very important subject; so, we are particularly glad that you are here to lend your voice because the issues of enhancing the environment is one of collaboration rather than isolation.
