The Guild of Medical Laboratory Science Directors (GMLD), Imo chapter, has expressed concern over the infiltration of quacks in the medical laboratory services in the state. Mr Nseabasi Peter, the state Chairman of the guild, raised the concern on Monday in Owerri, while briefing newsmen after paying a courtesy call on the Secretary to the Government of Imo, Mr Uche Onyeagocha. Peter also complained that the previous previous administrations did not carry the guild along. He therefore urged the present administration to make use of the guild, saying that the use of quacks to carryout professional duties of experts was an aberration. “The hiring of quacks in place of certified personnel of Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN) to perform professional duties of experts is an aberration,” he said. He expressed the readiness of the guild to partner with the Chief Emeka Ihedioha-led government in rebuilding the health sector in the state. He said: “Records have it that only two medical laboratory scientists are in the Local Government Civil Service pay roll whereas non-professionals, non MLSCN licensed persons were hired to perform our primary duties. “We hereby call for the employment of medical laboratory scientists in the primary health care centers. “This is to ensure that quality medical diagnostic services are rendered to the rural populace as part of the rebuilding Imo agenda of the governor.’’ (NAN)
