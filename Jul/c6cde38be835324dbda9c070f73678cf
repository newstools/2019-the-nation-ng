Anambra State Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Kate Omenugha has charged students in the state to have confidence in themselves and not to accept sex as condition for favours. She gave the advice in Awka, at the occasion organized to honour winner of Eastern Nigeria Secondary School’s Essay Competition, Miss Veronica Nnalue. She said she was impressed with Nnalue’s capacity, describing her as a child of destiny whose innate greatness should not be hindered. The commissioner enjoined her to remain a role model for others, urging her to educate her peers on the dangers of keeping late nights. She said, “Let your peers know that they should not accept sex as a condition for any favours, instead they should have confidence in themselves and believe that they are untouchables. “Go into the world and display your potential, influence the female students on how they can maintain their pride of place as women.” According to Omenugha, schools in the state were globally competitive as a result of the high standards set by the present government. She cited example of Queens of Rosary College (QRC), Onitsha that recently emerged winners of quiz competition sponsored by ANCOPPS. “St. John of God Secondary School, Awka is also one of the best schools in the state,” she added.
