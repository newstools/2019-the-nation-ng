A 45-year-old man, Emmanuel Toviho, on Friday appeared in a Badagry Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State for allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl. Toviho, whose address is not provided, faces a two-count charge of rape and sexual assault, to which he pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, ASP. Akpan Nkem, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on July 6 at Godo Guest House, Ibereko in Badagry. Nkem said that Toviho unlawfully had sexual intercourse with the girl without her consent. “The defendant forcefully penetrated the girl’s private part without her consent. “He also conducted himself in a manner likely to breach the peace,’’ the prosecutor said. Ikem said that the offences contravened Sections 168 and 259 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Patrick Adekomiya, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N300, 000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the case until Aug.6. (NAN)
