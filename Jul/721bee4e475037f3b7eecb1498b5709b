The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has suspended its 12-day old strike in Cross River, it was learnt. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suspension was contained in a communique issued at the end of the association’s Annual General Meeting yesterday in Calabar. According to NAN,  the doctors embarked on indefinite strike following the kidnap of their member, Dr Marcus Inyama, on July 18 in Akpabuyo Local Government. The communique said the strike was suspended because Inyama was released on July 26. “Arising from the meeting and taking into serious cognisance the health care needs of the people of Cross River, NMA in Cross River has suspended the notice of total and indefinite strike across the state. “Accordingly, members …have been instructed to resume work immediately. “The association will without fail keep to its January 8, 2018, resolution in the event of the kidnap of a doctor or their dependents.” “The resolution states that NMA will henceforth withdraw all medical services without any notice anytime a doctor or dependents are taken captive in future,” it said. It urged the government and security agencies to do more to safeguard life and property. “NMA is appealing to the legislature and Governor Ben Ayade to pass and assent to the state anti-kidnapping bill.” The association, however, thanked security agencies, the governor, legislature and the press for their efforts and commitment to the safe release of their colleague.
