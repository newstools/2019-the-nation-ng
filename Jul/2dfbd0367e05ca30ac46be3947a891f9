Celebrities like Banky W, Adesuwa Etomi, Toke Makinwa, DJ Obi, DJ Lambo, Reminisce and Teni The Entertainer, among others, have revealed how they succeeded in Nigeria’s super competitive entertainment industry. They said this at the second edition of BUDXLagos, a global programme that connects and spotlights creative minds in music and pop culture from around the world, which held in Lekki, Lagos, recently. The event, a collaboration of Budweiser in conjunction with Mixmag, was an atmosphere of music, fun games and beer. In Teni’s case, the ‘For Your Case’ crooner said her family were against her going into entertainment as her older sister, Niniola, was already a popular singer and one entertainer in the family was already one too many. She explained how she pushed through and eventually won them over with the success of her career. Adebayo Oke-Lawal, Creative Director and founder of Orange Culture sai that the hate he received while trying to create his brand only spurred him on. “I was bullied because I dressed differently, liked colors that weren’t considered for men, my voice was too thin,” he said. “Orange Culture became a brand that was created to be a home for people who saw masculinity in a different light” On Air Personality Toke Makinwa tackled the issue of unequal pay in entertainment and a total disregard for the female gender. She however, explained that to overcome the unfair treatment of women in entertainment is to become exceptionally good at your craft that no one sees you as a female on air personality, a female DJ, or practically a female anything. At the end of each session, the disc jockeys like DJ Obi, DJ Nana, DJ Jillionaire and DJ Crowd Kontroller and the others holding down the musical forte, guests going wild on the dance floor dancing to their unique mesh of oldies and new hit songs that got people off their seat, busting a move.
