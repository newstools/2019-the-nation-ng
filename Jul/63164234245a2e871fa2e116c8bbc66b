The management of Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu, has urged striking non-academic staff members to shelve their alleged planned attacks on the academic staff members and respect the ruling of the National Industrial Court (NIC) which directed them to maintain peace and eschew violence on the campuses of the Polytechnic. In a statement by the polytechnic’s Deputy Registrar, Information and Public Relations, Mr Olanrewaju Kuye, members of the striking non-academic unions were advised to wait for the court’s final adjudication on the matter. The statement reads: ”Management made this call in reaction to an audio recording making rounds inciting the non-academic staff members against the academic staff members who have been working to ensure that the academic calendar is not truncated, the finalists are being mobilised for the compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) exercise. ”In the same vein, the striking members of the polytechnic are advised to respect the freedom of association and allow the academic staff members and other willing staff to continue their primary assignments without any form of molestation or harassment. ”The striking members of staff are admonished to listen to wise counsels, embrace dialogue and wait for the outcome of the Head of Service, Lagos State House of Assembly and NIC to conclude their efforts at proffering lasting solution to the crisis of Consolidated Tertiary Institution Salary Structure (CONTISS 15) Migration. “It would be recalled that the agitation for the implementation of CONTISS 15 migration by the non-academic staff unions is an issue that NASU and SSANIP have been using since 2016 to foment troubles in the polytechnic.” Kuye said the grouse of the unions was that they wanted the polytechnic’s management to migrate all staff with no recourse to the NBTE guidelines and approval of the state government simply because some of the union leaders did not meet the requirements. ”While we pray that the few striking members of the polytechnic would allow Governor Babajide Sanwoolu to settle down for work in peace, it should also be noted that insistence by these few workers on self-help through intimidation, threats and incitement against the law-abiding staff would be curtailed by adequate measures of caution as permitted by the law.”
