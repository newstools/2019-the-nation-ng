A staff of the independent national election commission, (INEC) Asaba, Mr. Onyali Henry on Wednesday disowned some documents issued by the electoral umpire during the recent Delta State Governorship Election. Onyali, a principal executive officer, who appeared on subpoena before the Justice Suleiman Belgore led the Delta State Election Petition Tribunal disowned exhibits P5 and P5A (smart card reader results) during cross-examination. Lead counsel to the APC governorship candidate, Nichols Ichekor asked that the witness to be shown exhibits P5 and P5A (smart card reader result) among other documents. But the witness (RW5) rejected the documents saying, “These documents are not from our office.” Earlier, counsel to the petitioner had applied orally that all the evidence given by PW14, PW15 and PW19 be expunged from the record of the tribunal based on a ruling by the tribunal. Mr. Onyali tendered documents including forms EC8C, EC8D and EC8E and INEC official receipt which was admitted as exhibits RA35-1-25, RA36, and RA37. Also, Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa (1st respondent) closed his defence after a ten day defence tendering certified true copies of documents including forms EC8C, EC8D and EC8E and calling 10 witnesses. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) (2nd respondent) is due to commence its defence. PDO lead counsel, Mr. A.T Kehinde (SAN) however, applied for time to study the petition. Justice Belgore adjourned hearing to July 26th 2019.
