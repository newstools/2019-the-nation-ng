Senator Elisha Abbo has pleaded not guilty to the assault charge against him. The senator said this on Monday during his arraignment at the Magistrate Court in Zuba for allegedly assaulting a nursing woman at an adult toy shop in Abuja. The offence, which borders on criminal force and assault, is contrary to section 263 and 264 of Penal Code law. Abbo, dressed in lilac colour native mounted the dock at 2:55pm and pleaded not guilty to the two count charge against him. The senator, who was smiling throughout the proceedings, was also seen taking selfie with people. The prosecution counsel, James Idachaba told the court the police were yet to conclude investigation in the matter, thereby requesting more time. He asked the court for adjournment to enable the investigators conclude investigation and open their case. The defence counsel Adegbite Isaac Adeniyi prayed the court to grant his client bail on self recognition as a serving senator. Adeniyi, while arguing that the defendant would not jump bail and promising that he will always be present to face his trial, added that he will not interfere with the investigation. “He is a public figure and will not commit any offence. He will also not destroy any evidence that the prosecutor may have against him ” He said that the alleged offence is bailable and if granted bail, it will not undermine the purpose of criminal prosecution. In his ruling to the bail application, Magistrate Abdullahi Ilellah admitted that it was a bailable offence and the purpose of granting bail is to grant the defendant time to face his trial. He granted the defendant bail worth N5million with two sureties who must have verifiable addresses within the Federal Capital Territory. The magistrate therefore adjourned the matter to 22nd July 2019.
