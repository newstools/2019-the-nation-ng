A woman was on Monday night rescued by the police from being mobbed in Amukoko, Lagos. It was gathered that some youths found charms and other items under the woman’s cap. Residents, it was learnt, had been agitated for some days following the disappearance of a baby. A resident, Gabriel Oyebanji, said the woman was strangely dressed and was not a familiar face in the area. He added: “People suspected that the woman was a kidnapper and they confronted her, but she denied the allegation. Then they beat her up and told her to remove her cap, but she refused. “She was later taken to the leader of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) in the community where her cap was removed. Kolanut and charms were found underneath the cap. “The people told the OPC leader to release the woman to them so that they would kill her, but he refused and immediately called the police. “This infuriated the boys and they fought the OPC and the police. The woman was later taken away by the police.”
