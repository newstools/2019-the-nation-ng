AS the nation waits with bated breath for the announcement of the second term cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari, the minds of concerned observers are agitated with many questions. Who makes the cabinet’s list? Will politicians dominate the list as it was in the President’s first term? Will it be a cabinet of technocrats, considering that the President has hinted that he would work with people who will really help him to make a difference? Sentry has been trying to have a glimpse of what the President is putting together, and what has come to light so far is the clash of interests in many states. Some ex-this, ex-that who are determined to make the list are battling well respected technocrats being pushed forward by powerful interests. The ex-this and ex-that are threatening fire and brimstone should the President skip them for “people who contributed nothing to the victory of the APC.” One such technocrat being resisted is the chief executive of a parastatal with links to tertiary institutions.
