Matti defeated Omeh Amadi to come out top in the youth men’s singles event at the just concluded NTTF National Junior and Youth League at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. Matti took home  N80,000 after proving his worth in a 3-2 (5-11, 11-8, 10-12, 11-6, 14-12) victory against Omeh. The runner-up got N40,000 . An excited Matti said: “I feel very happy and also surprised because I never thought I could win the game. “My opponent was leading 12-11, then I took a point which was an edge but he insisted that it wasn’t an edge. Later, the umpire said it was an edge, so that made me win the competition. “I have been training so hard for this competition and also I have been looking forward to winning because a lot of people said I will be the one to win the championship.”
