Master Agent, Eti-Osa LGA Bet9ja, Clement Atakpo said the aim of the tournament, which will be on knockout basis, is to give young players the opportunity to exhibit their talents. “This is an initiative brought to the fore by Bet9ja and the idea is to identify specific empowerment program in different localities that they want to support. In Eti-Osa for instance, we know that the youths are passionate about football. “We are using the competition as a major youth empowerment program aimed at discovering talents that we can nurture and take to the next level and engage them positively rather than involving in all the social vices.” Project Consultant, Opeyemi Lawal said the tournament is opened to everyone in respective of age. “This is an open tournament. It is the first edition which is the  pilot scheme and we are looking forward to a better one in the next edition. Hopefully by November we will be having a talent hunt program which will have age bracket. But for the talents we will discover from this tournament, instead of allowing them to waste away, we will put them together, train them routinely and support them so that they can get better,” Lawal said. The winner of the tournament will go home with 150,000, while the second and third placed teams will be rewarded with the sum of N100,000 and N75,000 respectively for their efforts.
