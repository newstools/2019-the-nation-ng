Former European champion – Austria’s Robert Gardos has
acknowledged the quality of players heading to the 2019 ITTF Challenge Plus
Nigeria Open but the France-based star is ready to rock the boat with the top
stars. Being the second time the Austrian star will be heading to
Africa but this time, he wants to make an impact when the tournament serves off
on August 7 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. The Hungaria-born Austrian star admitted the timing of the
tournament fits into his calendar in readiness for the new season. However, the
former European Youth Champion is not going for vacation this time in the West
African nation but hopes to make a statement in the tournament. “I think the tournament fits into my calendar for the new
season preparation and I will try to make a good result for my ranking to
qualify for the next Olympic Games in Japan. Despite not knowing much about the tournament, Robert Gardos
believes he was convinced by some of the top players to be part of Africa’s
elite competition. “I did not know much and I have never been to Nigeria
before. I am aware it is a Challenge Plus tournament which has always been well
organised in an exciting atmosphere,” he said. With a modest ambition heading to Lagos, Robert Gardos said:
“I hope to play a good level of my game and hope to make it to the last eight
and be among the top four in the men’s singles.” Recalling his maiden visit to Africa, the Austrian star
said: I was in Egypt for a tournament a long time ago, where I also had a
vacation. I have not visited many countries in Africa before and I hope to
enjoy every moment in Lagos.”
