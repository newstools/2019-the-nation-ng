Hon Dalyop Fom, Member, representing Jos South Constituency in the Plateau House of Assembly, has employed 25 youths and will be paying them with his entire monthly salary. Fom made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Jos on Saturday. The lawmaker said that the painstaking decision was to reduce unemployment in his constituency. He said that the 25 youths who were from the five districts of his constituency would be working in his constituency office as liaisons with their districts. “I took this painstaking decision in a bid to contribute my own quota in curbing the worrisome issue of unemployment. “This implies that rather than using my earnings for my personal needs and benefit, I chose to use it to fill those of my constituents,’’ he said. Fom said that he would continue to initiate ideas and programmes that would impact on the lives of his constituents. According to him, doing so is my little way of giving back to the people who ensured my unhampered triumphant victory at the polls. (NAN)
