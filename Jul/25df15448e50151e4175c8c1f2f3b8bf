THE Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has ordered the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), Michael Ogbizi, to immediately take over the investigation into the alleged rape case against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA). The IGP said the order would ensure a speedy, thorough, fair and impartial investigation into the rape allegation by Mrs Busola Dakolo, wife of singer Timi Dakolo, against Fatoyinbo. A statement in Abuja by the Force spokesman DCP Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said the DIG will also take over the investigation of Fatoyinbo against the Dakolos. The DIG, as part of the investigation, will provide a personal supervision to all parts of the investigation to ensure justice and fair-hearing to all the parties, with each case being treated purely on its merit. Operatives from the Special Tactical Squad (STS) from Abuja, on Saturday, served a letter of invitation on the home of the Dakolos in Lagos. Following criticism that trailed the manner in which the operatives of the STS unit served the letter on the Dakolos, the police said: “The IGP has directed that the procedure which the police operatives adopted in serving invitation letters on Timi and Busola Dakolo on Saturday, July 20, be subjected to rigorous and discreet scrutiny to ascertain its conformity with police standard operating procedure and international best practices.” The police chief urged members of the public and the parties involved in the cases to remain calm and patient, assured of professionalism in the matter.
