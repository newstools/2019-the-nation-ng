Boeing’s first half (Q1) aircraft deliveries dipped 37 per cent as the grounding of the 737 MAX continues to impact the firm, investigations revealed. Three Nigerian airlines, Air Peace, Arik Air and Green Africa Airways placed orders for over 118 Boeing 737-800 max aircraft, which are due for delivery in the next few years. While Green Africa Airways placed order for 100 of the aircraft type valued at $11.7 billion, Air Peace placed order for 10, while Arik Air placed order for eight of the airplane. Investigations revealed that total deliveries of commercial aircraft for the first six months were down from 378 in 2018, to 239 this year, with 737 deliveries slumping to 113 from 269. For the second quarter 2019, only 24 737s were handed over to customers; none of them from the MAX family. Other aircraft returned similar numbers to last year, but the 767 jumped from the previous year’s nine to 22, as Boeing ramped up production of the 767 tanker for the US Air Force. Findings revealed that the 737 MAX grounding continues after an additional problem was identified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during a simulator test of updated flight control software. US operators of the MAX series have removed them from their flight schedules until September at the earliest. Boeing, investigations revealed, has already reduced 737 productions to 42 per month, but if the grounding and its inability to deliver continues, production may be trimmed further. Statistics from Boeing revealed that to date, orders for the aircraft were in negative territory for the first six months, with a total of minus 119 net orders to the end of June. Information gleaned from Boeing websites revealed that “the 737 was the cause of the swing, with 180 cancellations or changes reflected in the numbers.
