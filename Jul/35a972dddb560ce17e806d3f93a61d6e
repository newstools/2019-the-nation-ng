Market analysts, however, remained cautious. “We expect bearish performance to dominate activities in the market, although we see opportunity for bargain hunting,” Afrinvest Securities stated. Analysts at Cordros Securities maintained their conservative outlook for the equities market in the short to medium term, citing the absence of any catalysts to drive positive market returns. Most analysts agreed that the stock market had been weakened by macroeconomic uncertainties due to the emerging political situation. Managing Director, Network Capital, Mr Oluropo Dada, said political risk was a major factor noting that early determination of the presidential election result at the tribunal and appointment of ministers will further create legitimacy for the government and give clearer direction to foreign investors who are major drivers of the market. Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds Limited, Mallam Kasimu Garba Kurfi said early release of the ministers’ list could clear the macroeconomic uncertainties about who will lead the economic agenda of the government.
