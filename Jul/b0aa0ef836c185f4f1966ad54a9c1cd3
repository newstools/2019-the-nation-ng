Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have commended the Supreme Court for rejecting the application by the All Progressives Congress (APC), seeking a review of the May 24  judgement of the court on the voided  Zamfara state elections. The governors, in a statement on Monday by the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Mr Seriake Dickson, threw their weight behind the five-man panel of justices, led by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivor. The apex court had dismissed the APC’s application as incompetent and lacking in merit. The statement said “Providence has by this verdict, put a stamp of approval on the exceptional developments achieved in the state by Gov. Bello Matawalle since being sworn in on May 29, 2019. “God stopped their sinister plan to thwart the people-oriented human, social, economic, environmental and structural development blueprints that Matawalle and his team have already rolled out for the state. “We, in the PDP and majority of the good people of Zamfara, will welcome any errant but repentant APC politician, who sheds negativity and joins hands with us to implement policies that will further this State. “May the good Lord give Governor Bello Matawalle the wisdom, strength and foresight to expand the developmental territories of Zamfara to a height that the entire people of the state will be proud of”.
