Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said that the screening and confirmation of the nominees would begin on Wednesday. He added that other legislative activities in the chamber would take back seat to ensure the speedy completion of the important assignment. Lawan said this after reeling out the list on the floor of the upper legislative chamber of the national assembly on Tuesday. “The screening of the ministerial nominees will commence tomorrow morning,” he said. “All other legislative activities will take back stage for this very important national assignment.” President Muhammadu Buhari sent 43 ministerial nominees for confirmation. Some of those who made it back are Rotimi Amaechi, ex-minister of transportation; Mohammed Bello, ex-minister of federal capital territory (FCT); and Chris Ngige; ex-minister of labour and employment; and Abubakar Malami, minister of justice among others.
