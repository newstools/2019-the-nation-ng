 AN Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama, on Wednesday, sentenced a 31-year-old driver Nasiru Ibrahim to five years imprisonment for stealing 1,200 litres of fuel. Judge Lawal Suleiman sentenced Ibrahim after he pleaded guilty to stealing 1,200 litres of fuel from a tanker laden with petrol which he was told to deliver somewhere. Suleiman, however, gave the convict an option of N50,000 fine or spend five years in prison, and to also pay N300,000 as compensation to the complainant. The judge said the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such act of cheating. Prosecutor Daniel Longwal told the court that the case was reported on October 10 at the Nasarawa Gwong Police Station by Ibrahim Haji of Rikkos, who is the complainant. The prosecutor said the convict was entrusted with a tanker loaded with fuel and he sold 1,200 litres of the fuel valued at N162,000 and converted the money to personal use. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Sections 287 and 307 of the Penal Code. On arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. Also, an out-of-work man was ordered to sweep court premises for stealing cloth. A Grade 1 Area Court in Karu, Federal Capital Territory, on Wednesday, ordered a 27-year-old woman, Joy Alake, to sweep the court premises for two weeks for stealing nine pieces of wrappers and four skirts worth N68,000. The convict pleaded for leniency.
