 GROUP Managing Director, Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe has reiterated the gains of cultivating savings culture among the youths. He spoke when he visited the Ebonyi University Staff School, called the ‘CEO School’ in Abakaliki to mark the 2019 World Saving Day. Addressing the students, Wigwe, represented by the Zonal Head, Commercial Banking East, Access Bank Plc., Fidel Ibeabuchi, said, “Imbibing a savings culture is an important aspect of child development, and as parents, guardians and teachers, it is our responsibility to instill in them this mentality. In addition, it encourages a sense of discipline and planning, which can also be applied in other parts of your lives. As you grow up, pay attention to your finances, because whatever habits you learn and adopt now will lay a foundation for your future.” Following the allocation of schools by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to licensed banks, Access Bank visited schools in Lagos, Taraba, Nassarawa, Jigawa, Akwa Ibom, and Enugu States. The World Savings Day celebration follows other commendable projects of Access Bank to promote a savings culture among Nigerians, which also include its partnership with MTN at the mPulse planet to educate pre-teens and teenagers on the importance of practicing good savings culture through new and interesting ideas. The bank celebrated World Savings Day with customers across the country by engaging school children in six geo-political zones on the importance of building an early savings culture and improving their future through financial independence. The essence of the World Savings Day, which was celebrated by financial institutions and other related organisations in October 31,  was to increase public awareness on the importance of savings both for households and for the national economy. This also encompasses the CBN’s initiative to bridge financial literacy and inclusion particularly for children in Nigeria.
