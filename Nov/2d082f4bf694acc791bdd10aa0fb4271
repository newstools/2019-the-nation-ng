Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday expressed concern over attack on the Kogi State secretariat of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) by thugs alleged to the loyal to a political party. PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, urged the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, to bring the perpetrators of such a heinous crime to book. Ologbondiyan also condemned the threats of violence on the PDP, noting that such would never deter the party from attaining victory in the November 16 governorship election. He said that the party’s position was predicated on reported threats by a governorship candidate and his party to unleash violence and disrupt PDP campaigns in Kogi Central Senatorial Zone. The PDP spokesperson said such person was apparently distressed by the massive support the PDP candidate, Mr. Musa Wada, was enjoying across the state. He said that the people of Kogi were on the move with the PDP in their readiness to confront and dismantle planned violence. He also called the attention of security agencies to reports of a training ground for thugs in Kogi Central District. He urged the Inspector General of Police and the military hierarchy to immediately call Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC to order. Ologbodiyan also called for  urgent steps to ensure adequate security to safeguard lives and property in the run-up to the November 16 election in the state.
