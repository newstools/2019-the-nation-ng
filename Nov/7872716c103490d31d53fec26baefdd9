By Adeniyi Adewoyin  Rapper Eedris Abdulkareem, who is known for lending his voice against bad governance and societal issues through music has joined forces with Dr. Joe Okei Odumakin on a new song titled ‘Onyema Onyema’ in appreciating Chief Allen Onyema, the CEO of Air Peace for his support in bringing home stranded Nigerians from South Africa in the height of the recent xenophobic attacks. Explaining why he chose to honour Onyema with the song, Eedris said: “I extol and commend Chief Onyema for his love for Nigeria, irrespective of whose side the pendulum swings. His labour of love is simply unquantifiable and worthy of emulation, this kind of patriotic and unbiased actions should be celebrated by all and sundry so that people like Chief Onyema will continue doing what they do. Nigeria needs men like him to get to the eldorado. Men with hearts of gold.” The soong is the result of the creative merger  between Lakreem Entertainment and Centre for Change Initiative . On the reason he collaborated with Dr. Odumakin, the rapper cum activist averred. “We are kindred spirits. Dr. Joe Okei Odumakin has my kind of spirit and she is a fighter amongst fighters, a true amazon whose sincerity and tenacity of purpose is unquestionable. Then again, her love for Nigeria equals mine, and that informed my decision to partner with her in the project as a worthy icon and heroine of our time, solid enough, untainted and unfettered enough to celebrate yet another worthy Icon of Nigeria in the person of the Air Peace CEO.” According to the management of Lakreem Entertainment, the audio/visual offering of the single ‘Onyema Onyema’ will be hitting the airwaves in a fortnight. “Let us encourage, celebrate and project the best in the land and not the worst of the society, as the society will ultimately become what we the citizens make of it,” Eedris said.
