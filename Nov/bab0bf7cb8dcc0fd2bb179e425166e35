THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday began the distribution of sensitive materials to various Registration Area Centres (RACs) in Bayelsa State ahead of today’s  governorship election. Officials of the commission, party agents, national and international observers were present at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the exercise. Mr. Monday Udoh, the Resident Electoral Commission (REC), told journalists that INEC was fully ready to conduct credible election for the people. He said: “We are here to observe and monitor the movement of the materials; the sensitive materials are ballot paper, result sheets and card readers. “The distribution is moving smoothly. The security agents are here and officials of the National Union of Road Transporter Workers (NURTW) are also with us. The police have deployed many of their men for this and the election proper. “The electorate should be civil, peaceful, conduct themselves well and listen to instructions, especially from the security personnel.” Mr Tari Ere, a local government party agent for All Progressives Congress (APC) for Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, expressed worries over seemingly unavailable materials, including result sheets. “What is keeping us here are wards 9, 10, 11 voters registers and we are good to go; although, we are having some issues in ward 15 Southern Ijaw where result sheets were not available. “But they brought  replacement sheets, which have been certified. So we are good to go and we are very comfortable with the distribution processes.” Also, Mr Victor Ateki, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) agent for Brass Local Government Area of the state, expressed worries over their materials passing through Nembe due to the crisis in the area.
