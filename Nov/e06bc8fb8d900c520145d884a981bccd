Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, on Friday dissolved the seven-year-old marriage between one Abiodun Osobukola and his wife, Omolara, over alleged infidelity and childlessness. Odunade held that Omolara may have known that she was guilty of the allegations leveled against her, adding that this may explain her absence in court. He consequently dissolved the union in the interest of peaceful coexistence. In his petition to the court, Abiodun, a veterinary doctor and resident of Omiadio area of Ibadan, said he was determined to end his seven-year-old marriage because his wife was adulterous and had no child for him. “Since 2012 when Omolara and I got married to one another, she had been engaging in acts that could make any man give up on marriage even though I endured. “Such actions include sleeping with different men and gossiping around in the neighbourhood. “This is coupled with the fact that Omolara has refused to be productive inspite of my efforts. “In fact, she specifically told me to look for another wife and she has packed all her property from my house,” Abiodun said. Omolara was, however, absent for the third consecutive time to respond to the allegations leveled against her. The bailiff had informed the court that he had on several occasions served hearing notices on Omolara which she kept ignoring.
