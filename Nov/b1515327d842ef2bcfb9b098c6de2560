Senior management officers of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) have received a five-day training on strategic leadership and management in Abuja. The training, organised by the Centre for Management Development (CMD), was attended by 100 personnel of the NIS. It was the second phase of training for personnel of the NIS to be trained by the CMD this year. CMD’s Acting Director-General Bitrus Danharbi Chinoko, who was represented by the Acting Director, Administration and Human Resources, Mr Mohammed Nuhu, hailed the NIS leadership for its determination to invest in human capital development through training and retraining of personnel of the service. “We believe that everything rises and falls on leadership. That is why CMD is committed to building strategic leadership platforms in various government agencies. “This training is to expose officers to wider and more innovative ways of thinking, on a daily basis, about the entire goals of the organisation,” he said. NIS Comptroller-General Mohammed Babandeede, who was represented by Comptroller K. N. Nandap, showered encomiums on CMD for rendering quality service throughout the period of the training. He noted that the partnership of the two organisations had always yielded positive results in management of the NIS over the years.
