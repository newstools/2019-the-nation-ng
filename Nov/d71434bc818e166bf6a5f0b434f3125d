 A TANKER loaded with 33,000 litres of Premium Motor Spirit or petrol on Monday caught fire in the Ipaja area of Lagos. The intense fire spread to a nearby car, leaving only its charred frame. The tanker itself was half-burnt. The Nation gathered that the tanker was conveying allegedly stolen petroleum product from a vandalised pipeline. The explosion was said to have happened around 8am when the tanker hit an electric pole around Abesan Estate gate in  the area, resulting in the fire. There was traffic gridlock in the area and motorists had to use alternative routes. Respondents including the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and the Lagos state Fire Service came promptly on the scene but there was no loss of life. LASEMA Public Affairs Officer, Nosa Okunbor said the Agency’s Dolphin Squad at Lagos West was drafted to the fire scene around 8:18am. He said the truck was carrying petrol siphoned from a vandalised pipeline at the back of Honeyland School, Abesan Estate, Ipaja. “At the scene of the incident, we gathered that a tanker conveying stolen petroleum product from a vandalised pipeline came in contact with an electric pole which resulted in a fire outbreak. The residents of the area rallied support to control the fire before the arrival of the combined response team of LASEMA and the Lagos State Fire Service. “On arrival, the cooperative residents readily gave way for the combined response team of LASEMA and LASG Fire Service to perform their duties. We also contacted men of the NSCDC as well as officials of NNPC/PPMC for the trans-loading and recovery of the remaining PMS in tanker truck of the vandals,” he said.
