 THE Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons ( NAPTIP) Dame Julie Okak â€“ Dunli on Tuesday signed an agreement with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and other aviation authorities on new initiative to tackle the challenges of human trafficking and illegal migration through the airports and land borders. Donli said the challenges of human trafficking and illegal migration have become quite enormous that it requires new initiatives, which must be developed to ensure sustained successes against the twin monsters. Speaking at the Lagos Airport while handing over information, education and communication (IEC) materials to FAAN, she said the materials were given to increase vigilance and positive actions to intercept or interrupt suspected human trafficking activities as well as infuse counter-trafficking messages at conspicuous areas at major airports. The programme was put together with support from NAPTIP partners including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United States Department of State/ International Narcotics and Enforcement, International Air Transport Association (IATA) and NCAA. The NAPTIP boss directed airlines and FAAN to display counter-trafficking messages at the check-in and boarding areas, as well as along boarding gates. She specifically urged airlines to ensure they have such messages as part of the inflight audio and visual communications.
