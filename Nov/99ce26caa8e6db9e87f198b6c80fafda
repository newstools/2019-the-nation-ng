Since Samsung globally unveiled the Galaxy Fold and created a new mobile category, there’s been much hype about the extraordinary device. Not only is the Galaxy Fold infused with never-seen-before integration of tablet and phone, but it also encompasses incredible innovation in material, engineering and display. The Managing Director at Samsung Electronics West Africa, David Suh, said: “Samsung prides itself on being at the forefront of design and technology innovation and the Galaxy Fold is a testament to this. Quite simply, it’s a device that will change the way we use smartphones, as well as what we expect them to do into the future. I’m really looking forward to seeing user responses to this amazing device.” The Galaxy Fold will launch in Nigeria on November 14 at which time more details will be shared about local pricing, availability and where to purchase the device.
