 SIXTY-three pupils from seven public secondary schools in Lagos State have been presented with bronze medals of the Duke of Edinburgh award by the International Award for Young People in Nigeria on Tuesday at the Ikoyi residence of the Deputy British High Commissioner, Harriet Thompson. The pupils were found deserving of having completed requirements for the award, which included learning a skill, engaging in social services, keeping healthy through physical/sporting activities and adventurous journeys. The pupils drawn from Akande Dahunsi Memorial Senior High School, Osborne; Girls’ Senior Academy, Lagos Island; Okesuna Senior High school, Lagos Island; Badore Community Senior Secondary School, Badore; Lagos State Senior Model College, Badore; Etinosa Senior Community High School; and Olowu Community Senior Secondary School, were also given certificates, while their teachers (award leaders) and principals were publicly acknowledged for supporting them. Some of them testified to how undertaking the programme challenged them to learn and do things they would have considered doing outside their school work thereby gaining confidence, determination, and learning more about themselves. Kehinde Tomon of Okesuna Senior High School said she learnt that gaining other skills were crucial to success in life beyond academics. “Before the award, I had no interest  in skills. I had all my attention focused on my studies because I thought that was all I needed to be great in life.
