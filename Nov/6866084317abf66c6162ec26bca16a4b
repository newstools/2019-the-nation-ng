Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has promised to maintain a policy of zero tolerance for potholes on township roads from the next fiscal year. He said: “No stone will be left unturned at ensuring that we place maximum premium on road rehabilitation.” Prince Abiodun spoke while appraising the 2020 proposed expenditure of the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, at the Treasury Board Meeting on Year 2020 Budget, held at the Oba’s complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He said his administration would not be defined as an administration that allowed potholes to take over township roads, adding that work had begun on some of the roads. “Some of the roads earmarked for rehabilitation include Abeokuta South and North township roads, Akute, Ifo, Ewekoro, Odeda, Obafemi Owode-Egba, Mowe-Ibafo township roads in Ogun Central; in Ogun East, Ijebu-Ode- Ago- Iwoye, Ijebu-Igbo, Ogbere-Iperu-Sagamu, Ogijo, Odogbolu up to Remo township roads, and also for Ogun West, we plan to work on  Sango-Ota, Igbesa, Ado-Odo, Agbara, Ilaro-Owode-Yewa, Aiyetoro, Imeko up to Idiroko township roads,” he said.
