  Chairman of Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, has said no country can drive its democracy with a weak and compromised judicial system. Bamidele urged Nigerian universities and top legal practitioners to pay more attention to the production of lawyers who are morally sound and academically upright. This, he said, is the best way to help the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) build a strong, virile and sustainable legal system that can deepen the rule of law in the country. In a statement in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, the senator representing Ekiti Central was reacting to his appointment as a member of the prestigious Body of Benchers in Nigeria. Bamidele averred that good legal and judicial systems are best ingredients for steady growth and development of democracy. The senator noted that having lawyers who cherish dignity and sincerity would help in building a democratic culture that can drive development in all facets. He assured the nation that his membership of the prestigious body would be brought to bear in the operation of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate. Bamidele said this would in turn fortify lawmakers’ knowledge of legislation and imbue them with requisite knowledge on how best to run the country, in tandem with the constitution. “Legal and judicial systems are like Siamese twins. They co-exist and help each other in a mutual way. No democracy can grow where the two are bastardised and egregiously compromised. “That is why it is imperative and instructive to lay a rocky foundation for our legal system by, as a matter of necessity, ensuring that all legal institutions, ranging from universities to Law School and chambers where young lawyers observe pupillage, to harp on intellectual broadness and dignity to practise the profession.”
