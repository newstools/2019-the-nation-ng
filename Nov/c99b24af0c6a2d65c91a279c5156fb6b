Kolade Adeyemi, Kano  Rotarian Action Group for Population and Development yesterday adopted measures to halt the death of over 68,000 women through pregnancy-related complications in the country. The group’s National Coordinator for Rotary and Child Health Project, Prof. Emmanuel Adedolapo Lufadeju, spoke yesterday in Kano. He was accompanied by the group’s Northwest Coordinators. Lufadeju said the Rotarians were in Kano to map out a comprehensive agenda designed to tackle the high rate of maternal mortality in the country. The expert said the only panacea for reducing such deaths among pregnant women was to adopt child-spacing as well as the use of contraceptives. He said the disturbing trend is preventable. Lufadeju said about 20 million unsafe abortions take place in developing countries each year while as many as 700,000 women die from unsafe abortions, which he put at 13 per cent of maternal deaths. “Nigeria’s maternal mortality rate stood at 23 per cent from the total global deaths, which is too dangerous and must be reduced,” he said.
