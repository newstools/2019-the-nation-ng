By Lucas Ajanaku The Chief Executive Officer, Jumia Nigeria, Mrs Juliet Anammah, has stated that Keke Napep (Tricycle) is one of the bizarre things Nigerians searched for on the platform during the weeks leading to the company’s Black Friday campaign slated for today. This, according to her, is an affirmation of the trust that shoppers have in the platform for finding everyday essentials. Anammah, who spoke in Lagos, said entrepreneurs and consumers always remain the biggest beneficiaries of the Black Friday campaigns. This is because all the products listed on the Jumia platform are data driven to enable consumers find the products they want at a price that’s convenient for both the sellers and consumers. In line with the McKinsey’s Lion Go Digital Report, online shopping could account for up to 10 per cent of retail sales in Africa (with a value of around $75 billion) by 2025, as more Africans gain access to the internet.  “Campaigns such as Black Friday will contribute significantly to driving e-commerce adoption; we plan Black Friday campaigns six months ahead of time. We engage in consumer focus groups and multiple workshops with consumers to understand some of the things they want to buy on Jumia. So, it starts with the consumers first. We share the data we obtain with our sellers to influence the kind of products they should list on our platform during special campaigns like Black Friday and at a price that is convenient for both parties,” she said. Although Jumia introduced the Black Friday campaign to Nigerians in 2014, two years after it established its presence in the country, consumers’ response to the campaign has been tremendous. “Consumers response to Black Friday has been tremendous since we introduced the shopping event to Nigerians in 2014. Year on year, we’ve seen it grow. Nigerians are very responsive to campaigns like these.”
