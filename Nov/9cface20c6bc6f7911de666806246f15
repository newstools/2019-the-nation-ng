FBNInsurance Limited, one of the leading life insurance companies in Nigeria, has paid N5.4 billion claims settlements to its clients at the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Managing Director, Mr. Val Ojumah, has said. Ojumah, in a statement, stated that the company also paid N4.8 billion claims in 2018, despite the unpredictable economic situation in the country occasioned by the preparation for the general election at that time. He said the focus of the company was to maintain the indisputable leadership position in the life insurance sub-sector by paying claims promptly and at the same time protect the interest of its various corporate and individual clients.  According to him: “Ours is a business of trust and as part of our efforts geared towards maintaining irrefutable leadership in the life insurance sub-sector, we have built a solid foundation where our clients can insure their trust by promptly paying their claims. We have also deepened our footprints across Nigeria in our quest to serving our customers and shareholders even better than we have done in previous years. “Customer satisfaction is the fulcrum of insurance business and this inevitably builds customer loyalty and we will not fail to ensure this. We believe once FBNInsurance is able to pay customers’ claims as they arise, numerous customers and the general public will have faith to take up more life policies because they are convinced that should a claim/loss arise, FBNInsurance will be able to meet its financial obligations to them”. FBNInsurance is an FBNHoldings company associated with the Sanlam Group SA and was incorporated in 2010 to transact life insurance business in Nigeria and currently operates from over 40 outlets and two branches nationwide.
