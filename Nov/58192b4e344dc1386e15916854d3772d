 Super Eagles and Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi was named the Absa Premiership’s Player of the Months of September and October yesterday.
Chiefs’ Ernst Middendorp won the Coach of the Month award.
The awards were announced in a press conference at the offices of the Premier Soccer League in Parktown.
A delighted Akpeyi, who has kept four clean sheets in five matches, admitted after scooping the award that the honours came as a surprise to him.
“This comes as a big surprise to me but it also shows the importance of putting effort in whatever you do,” Akpeyi said.
“I give credit to the technical team that has been patient with me. I am settling in, I am taking each game as it comes. Khune is a good keeper, I am just grateful for the opportunity from the coach.
“It is healthy competition in that department. I am just happy to be improving all the time,” Akpeyi added. League leaders Chiefs lost their only league game of the season 1-0 against Polokwane City at FNB Stadium at the beginning of September.
They then won four games in a row until the end of November – beating AmaZulu 2-0 at King Zwelithini Stadium‚ Baroka FC 1-0 at FNB‚ Lamontville Golden Arrows 2-0 at FNB and Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 at Loftus Versfeld.
