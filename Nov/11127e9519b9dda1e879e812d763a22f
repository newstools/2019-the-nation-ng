By James Azania, Lokoja  Suspected political thugs on Tuesday attacked the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Barr. Natasha Akpoti at the stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. The meeting organised by INEC was for the signing of peace accord among the political parties and their candidates, ahead of Saturday’s poll in the state. According to an eyewitness: “The incident happened even while the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, the Inspector General, Mohammed Adamu, among other security chiefs, were all already seated for the program. “It took the efforts of the men of the Nigerian Army to rescue the SDP governorship candidate from the vicinity.” The SDP had earlier alleged of plans to attack the convoy of its candidate, while the party secretariat in Lokoja, was torched on Monday by yet- to- be identified hoodlums. While the party put the blame for the attacks on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the latter fired back, saying that they were neck deep into electioneering campaigns and had no time for frivolities.
