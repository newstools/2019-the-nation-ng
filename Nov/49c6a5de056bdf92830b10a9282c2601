Our Reporter  The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri,   yesterday accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with  the security agents to manipulate the election in the state. Senator Diri stated this shortly after casting his vote at his polling unit, ward six, unit four in Sampou community, Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area. He voted at about 10.40am. “It is going on peacefully in my unit and Kolga. Voting orderly here. It’s going on well here. However, I have reports of pockets of electoral fraud commited by APC, coming on with thugs to hijack materials denying PDP members from voting. I raised the red flag about Nembe Bassambiri. What I have is that no PDP agent is allowed to go into Nembe Bassambiri. At Eniware in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, the reports I have is that the APC thugs went there. The same with Opolo, and other places. But we are monitoring the process”, Diri stated. The PDP candidate also called on INEC to justify the huge investments on this election by ensuring free, fair and credible poll. Diri, called for cancellation of cooked up reports from where electoral materials were hijacked. “Let me call on the umpire first, the INEC, to be alive to their responsibility on the disturbing reports on the incidences we are hearing. Where they need to invoke their power, they should do so either not accepting cooked up results where materials have been hijacked”, Diri said. He stated, “we call on the security agencies not to take side with APC, which are the reports we are getting. Let them be professional and neutral so that the election will be credible and open. So that our party members are not harassed.”
