 LAGOS State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged members of Community Development Associations to monitor and supervise ongoing projects across the state in their communities. The governor gave the charge at the grand finale of the year’s Community Day celebration which held on Wednesday at the Police College Parade Ground, Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu described the CDAs and Community Development Committees (CDCs) as the real growth engines in the state. He harped on the need to ensure that contractors handling the various projects do a very good job. The event, with the theme: “Revising Rural Communities For 21st Century Development,” was organised by the Lagos State Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs. The governor said, “Our community development, the CDAs and the CDCs are the real engines of growth. They are the owners of all our interventions in government. They are the ones that own every intervention. Everything we are building is for the community; it’s for the local government. “So, it is important that the local government takes ownership of these development initiatives. We need to ensure that once we’ve sent contractors out, you should monitor them and ensure that they do and deliver quality service so that the schools, the hospitals, and the roads that those contractors are building meet the standard that is required of them. “You have to serve as monitors and ensure that the right proportions of things needed are used. You have the right to present your complaints to any contractor once you discover that the work is not properly done.” Ten community development associations with laudable community projects adjudged to be the best amongst all by the supervising ministry were presented with minibuses and other prizes.
