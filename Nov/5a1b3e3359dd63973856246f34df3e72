 LAGOSIANS have been reassured of their safety in the Centre of Excellence. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave the reassurance yesterday when he lauded operatives of the 81 Division, Nigerian Army (NA) for foiling attempts by Boko Haram terrorists to attack a university in the state. The Nation exclusively reported in its yesterday edition that army operatives had arrested eight suspects, including four directly involved in the botched attempt on the unidentified varsity. According to a statement by Lagos Information and Strategy Commissioner Gbenga Omotoso, the governor praised the gallantry of the officers who foiled the attempted attack. He reassured residents of government’s commitment to their safety as well those of visitors, noting that the security apparatus of the state has strategies in place to forestall any threat to the peace that exists in Lagos.  Omotoso said: “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will continue to provide the equipment and resources that are necessary to fortify the security machinery of the state. “Lagos remains safe and residents should maintain peaceful co-existence with one another.” He appealed to Lagosians to further complement the efforts of the security agencies by being observant at all times and ensure they reported any influx of unfamiliar people to law enforcement agencies because “security is the responsibility of all”. The commissioner added that unusual movements should be reported to the Lagos State Government through its emergency toll-free lines- 767 or 112.
