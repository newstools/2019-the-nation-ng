The two-year-old lion used as a guard by an Indian national at his Victoria Island residence, has been tranquilised and relocated to the Omu Resort Zoo in Lekki, the Lagos State Taskforce said on Monday. The agency had acted on a petition from residents of Muri-Okunola Street on the presence of a lion at house 229, assuring that the owner would be prosecuted for keeping a wild animal and putting the lives of other residents in danger. According to the Taskforce spokesman Taofiq Adebayo, the lion was brought in from Cameroun by the unnamed Indian two-years-ago, adding that it was tranquilised three times before evacuation to the zoo. Adebayo said the evacuation was done in collaboration with officials from the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture and medical personnel from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan (UI). The operation was supervised by Yinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) – Adebayo said the lion was tranquilised by Dr Ogunmo Bamidele who led the UI team. “Immediately I got the petition, I deployed my officers to the house at 229, Muri-Okunola Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, where they kept a close watch for more than 72 hours before the lion was finally removed today. “In as much as we appreciate residents around Victoria Island for their prompt action, we urge every member of the public to be observant in their immediate environment and report any strange or unusual activity to appropriate government authority for prompt action”, Adebayo said on behalf of Egbeyemi.Director, Veterinary Services, Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Macaulay Rasheed warned residents against rearing wild animals in residential areas to avoid unnecessary attack and contagious animal diseases.
