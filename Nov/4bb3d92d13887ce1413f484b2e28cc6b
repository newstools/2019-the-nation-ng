From Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  The Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, yesterday sacked the All Progressives Congress (APC) member representing Ilorin South Constituency, Hassan Azeez Oluwanilo, from the House of Assembly. It declared the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) candidate, Jimoh Raheem Agboola, as the winner of the March 9 poll. Delivering judgment, Justice Hamman Barkar Hkawu based the court’s decision on the disputed APC primaries, which produced Alhaji Suleiman Abdulsalam, popularly called Sule Cement, but he was later replaced with 28-year-old Oluwanilo. The court held that the APC had no valid candidate for the 2019 House of Assembly election and thereby declared the PDP candidate with the second highest votes, Agboola, as the winner of the poll. Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has congratulated Agboola on the Appeal Court judgment. The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, said: “What has happened today is one of the beauties of democracy. As respecters of the rule of law and decorum, we submit to the position of their Lordships and congratulate our brother from the opposition party.”
