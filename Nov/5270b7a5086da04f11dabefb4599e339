Managing-Director, Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin has called on residents to properly dispose of their domestic waste by bagging them and patronising designated Private Sector Participants (PSP) operators. In a statement by the agency, Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Folashade Kadiri said measures are being made to reposition the services of PSP operators in the state and ensure that household waste evacuation is carried out at least once a week. Dr Gbadegesin said residents should endeavour to pay for service rendered. The managing director noted that waste collection and disposal services were never free anywhere in the world, adding that rates currently payable by residents for such services were reasonable and advised that no one should indulge in illegal refuse disposal just to avoid payment. He further noted that LAWMA continues to position containers at strategic locations and distributes waste disposal bags across the state under its Blue Box initiative. He urged residents to properly sort their waste at source for recycling and to patronise PSP operators assigned to their areas and pay for waste collection. The LAWMA boss reiterated the Authority’s resolve to stamp out all forms of improper waste disposal in the metropolis, which has resulted in environmental degradation, urging residents to support efforts of the Authority to establish a cleaner and livable environment. Accordingly, he advised residents to desist from dumping waste indiscriminately on road medians, verges and gutters which in recent times had worsened the problem of flooding in the metropolis and exposed the populace to various degrees of health dangers. Gbadegesin reminded the general public of government’s zero tolerance for environmental abuse, as the Authority commenced total enforcement against indiscriminate waste dumping, insisting that ignorance of the law would not be taken as an excuse for anyone caught violating it.
