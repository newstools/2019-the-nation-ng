AFTER years of confrontation with his boss, a deputy governor in one of the states has turned into a submissive footman of the governor, following the decision of the latter to yield to his deputy the state’s security vote for one month. It was said that there had been no love lost between the governor and his deputy since they assumed the leadership of the state because the deputy governor kept complaining that he was not given any specific responsibility in the government. The petulant deputy governor was said to have written various petitions to the powers – that – be against the governor and even tried on various occasions to undermine the governor’s authority. All that however changed when the governor decided to proceed on leave and transmitted a letter to the state’s House of Assembly asking his deputy to act as governor in his absence. The governor returned from leave and found that his deputy had  barely touched the security vote for the month he was away. He called his deputy and asked why he left the security vote for the month he (governor) was on leave untouched, and the deputy said he felt that the money belonged to the governor and should not be tampered with. “No,” replied the governor, “the money is all yours.” The Deputy Governor could not believe his ears. “I alone?!” he exclaimed and went dumb for a minute or so before he could muster the words to thank the governor and sing his praises. Since then, he has become the governor’s praise singer, telling whoever cares to listen that his boss is the best governor that ever lived.
