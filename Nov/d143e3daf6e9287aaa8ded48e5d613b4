By Our Reporter  Twenty eight inmates of the Home for the Needy and Internally Displaced Persons Camp at Uhorgua in Edo State are currently studying various courses at the Edo State University, Iyamho. Coordinator of the centre, Mr. Solomon Folorunsho, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin yesterday. According to him, eight of the inmates are studying medicine, seven law, eight nursing and midwifery, one mechanical engineering, one international relations and diplomacy, while three others are undertaking some other courses. Folorunsho said another set of more than 100 inmates of the camp had been offered admissions to study various courses in universities in parts of the country. He said the IDPs were being sponsored in the universities with donations from public-spirited individuals and the International Christian Centre. The coordinator appealed to the Federal Government and the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Education Fund (UNICEF) to take over the sponsorship of the inmates. He identified key challenges plaguing the camp as accommodation, feeding, health and education issues, saying that the camp was in dire need of books and writing materials for more than 3,000 young people at the camp. Folorunsho said the camp had been approved as centre for external examinations by NECO, WAEC, GCE and NABTEB. According to him, the IDPs, who consume 10 bags of garri and 15 bags of rice daily, are fed twice everyday. He said that a clinic had been built at the centre, appealing to the general public to donate drugs and medical facilities to the camp.
