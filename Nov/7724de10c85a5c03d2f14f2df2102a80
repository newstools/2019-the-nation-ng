  Former Super Eagles midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, said there is no need to panic despite Nigeria’s poor run of results  recently  in international football  competitions. The  Golden Eaglets became the latest Nigerian team to exit an international competition when it lost  1-3 to The Netherland on Tuesday in the FIFA World Under -17 World Cup Brazil 2019. The CHAN Eagles had earlier lost to Togo in the qualifiers of the tournament  African  Nation Championship while  the Togolese also saw off Nigeria at the WAFU Cup of Nations. However, Adepoju popularly called the ‘Headmaster’ in his playing days lamented the sad occurrence but noted that it wasn’t the end for Nigerian football. “The round leather game is all about winning and losing but it is sad that we are losing; a lot can be done to reverse the trend,” Adepoju popularly called the ‘Headmaster’ in his playing days told  NationSport. “We need to start preparing for the next championships now. We have to put the defeats behind us and see how we can regain our past glory.” The former Real Betis player noted that there were players who can represent Nigeria at every level, adding that all that was needed was  to unearth the talents: “Nigeria is blessed with good players. What the coaches need to do is to extend their search to every corner of the country. “The only way out of the current sad situation is to start doing things the right way. The CHAN Eagles excited the WAFU and CHAN qualifiers because the league had not started.” The mercurial midfielder added: “We have not done well this time, but we can bounce back next time if we do the right things at all time.”
