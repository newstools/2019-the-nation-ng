 THE Lagos State Government and the First Investment Development Company (FIDC), developers of the upscale Ilubirin Foreshore Housing Project, have reiterated their commitment to the delivery of the housing estate by next year. Speaking during an inspection/facility tour of the project on Lagos Island, the Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai said with the pledge from the parties, Lagosians and, indeed, the public, which has been dreaming of  the housing complex would soon have such dreams fulfilled. “We have a solid plan to deliver the first phase of the project, which is residential in the fourth quarter of 2020 to be followed by the Commercial and Entertainment/Leisure Parks in 2021. Ilubirin is a critically important development for the city that will rejuvenate the area. We have a duty to ensure that more Lagos residents become home owners and that the homes themselves are built to global and international standards,” Akinderu-Fatai declared. Commending the initiative and steadfastness of the FIDC management to the realisation of the Ilubirin dream, the commissioner expressed optimism that when fully delivered, the project would go a long way in addressing the housing deficit in the state. The Project Director of FIDC, Wale Bamgbelu, said there is “a collective determination and commitment from both parties to the timely delivery of Ilubiri, which will set a new standard for mixed-used housing estates”. He added that Ilubirin will create a benchmark for future community development in Lagos state which is anchored on the concept of ‘live, work and play’. He explained that the Ilubirin first Residential offering, the “Premier Collection” will provide a total of 108 spacious apartments across five elegant blocks consisting of 20 studios, 64 two-bedrooms and 24 three-bedroom apartments carefully designed and detailed to provide some of the finest places to live in anywhere in the world.
