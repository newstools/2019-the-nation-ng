 THE people of Ugbene Umualor in Awka North Local Government Area of Anambra State, yesterday, blocked the Government House to protest the alleged imposition of a traditional ruler on them by the government. The community numbering over 200 stormed the state seat of power around 1.30pm, singing war songs with several placards with different inscriptions. Some of the placards read, “Allow Umualor to produce the next Eze Ukwu of Ugbene based on court order, we want peace in our community, Ugbene Umualor, Governor Obiano should order Commissioner to stop confusing our community.” Security officials blocked the protesters from entering the Government House. The spokesperson for the protesters, Jonas Okelue, accused the state commissioner for local government, chieftaincy and community affairs, Greg Obi of manipulating and causing confusion in their area. He said they went to court in 2019 and got judgement in 2019 that the people should select who would rule them. Based on that, according to Okelue, the kingmakers were dissolved, but the commissioner came to use the dissolved kingmakers to cause disaffection in our community. Other community leaders, Chief Alfred Offor and Chief Wilson Okoye said Ndi Umualor in the community deserve to present the new monarch as tradition demanded. They said they were ready to use all means to resist the imposition of anybody on the community, adding that it was their right to make their selection. The commissioner for local government, chieftaincy and community affairs, Greg Obi, assured them that their problems would be resolved in no distant time. Obi who was represented by Henry Nwasike, the Public Relation’s Officer of the Ministry, commended them for not being violent in their protest. He said Governor Willie Obiano  will look into their agitations with a view to solving them.
