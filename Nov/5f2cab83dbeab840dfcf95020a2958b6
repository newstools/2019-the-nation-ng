Thirty-eight young engineers comprising 29 males and nine females have graduated from the 2019 Sahara Graduate Engineering Programme (GEP). The GEP is an annual capacity building initiative of Sahara Power Group through its arms – Egbin Power Plc and First Independent Power Limited (FIPL) in collaboration with the National Power Training Institute (NAPTIN), to close the manpower gap in the power sector. The new graduates, who were offered certificates during the graduation ceremony held in Lagos. According to the Group Managing Director of Sahara Power  Group, Mr. Kola Adesina, with the graduation of the 2019 batch, the total number of young engineers that have undergone the programme since its commencement in 2014 is 198. Kola Adesina said the trainees were selected out of over 8,500 applicants after a very rigorous process, adding that they were chosen from various fields of engineering professions including electrical, chemical, electronic and mechanical. He said: “Over the past 12 months, they have embarked on intensive classroom training and hands-on activities across power generation, operations, distribution, transmission, electricity and commercial awareness. “These rigorous sessions were conducted by seasoned power experts, so I am confident that this foundation will empower our future power experts to transform the sector as they progress in their careers.” The Director-General of NAPTIN, Mr. Ahmed Nagode, said the GEP was a very important and fundamental programme in the career of a professional engineer in the power sector. “It is a programme that bridges the gap between academic qualification of BSC/HND in Electrical and Mechanical engineering and the skills required to operate on the power networks,” Nagode said.
