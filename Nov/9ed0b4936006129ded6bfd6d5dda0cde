A MIDDLE-aged man, Sampson Paul standing trial for robbery, told an FCT High Court that on the day the alleged crime took place, he was in faraway Auchi, Edo State, attending a wedding. The police charged Paul with criminal conspiracy, armed robbery and attempt to commit murder. Under cross-examination, Paul said on July 6, 2017, the day the police alleged the offence took place, he was with his fiancee in Auchi for her sister’s wedding. “I work at Interconnect Hotel at Dutse Alhaji and I was given four days casual leave to attend the wedding,” he said. I left Abuja on July 4, 2017 and returned on July 11, 2017.” Asked to show evidence that he traveled to Auchi on the day of the incident, the defendant said the police seized his letter of approval for the casual leave. He also said the ticket given to him by Peace Mass transport was destroyed because it rained heavily that day. “The police tortured and forced me to sign a written statement on something I know nothing about,” he said.
