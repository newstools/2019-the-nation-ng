Lagos State government said it has trained over 30,000 drivers from January till date and also retrained 200 others who were apprehended for contravening traffic laws. Acting General Manager of Lagos State Driver’s Institute (LASDRI), Mrs Afusat Tiamiyu disclosed this yesterday at the public enlightenment campaign on unlocking traffic gridlock through drivers’ education which took place at Tipper Garage, Ojota yesterday. The campaign which had over 500 tipper drivers attached to the garage in attendance, will also go round other garages in Lagos, according to Tiamiyu. She said the campaign is for drivers to know what is expected of them and what to do on the roads to be better drivers and to expose them to basic technology, “we want zero tolerance for accidents especially during this festive period. “Accidents don’t just happen they are caused majorly by drivers, that is why we have brought our services to them, to let them know that Lagos state government values their lives and has a passion for the safety of lives and property, we want them to be better drivers and to continue to drive and be better drivers. “This is the added contribution that the Lagos State Drivers’ Institute makes to our lives while training professional drivers as part of being the fulfilment of the government for efficient traffic management and transportation in Lagos State.” She urged motorist to desist from road vices such as speed violation, overloading, drunk driving, use of cell phones, non-use of the seatbelt, over-speeding, dangerous driving, traffic lights/sign violation, lane indiscipline, use of worn-out tyres and underage driving to avoid being prosecuted.
