AN Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday remanded a 43-year-old man, Amarachi Chukwuneke, in Kirikiri Correctional Centre, for allegedly defiling his six-year-old daughter. Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olufunke Sule-Amzat, said Chukwuneke should be remanded pending advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Sule-Amzat also directed that the case file should be sent to the DPP for advice. The prosecutor, ASP Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 4 at his residence. Emuerhi said that the defendant defiled his daughter of about six years, when her mother was not around. “The mother noticed that the girl always cry anytime she washes her private parts while bathing. “She decided to take her to the hospital for a medical checkup, and it was at the hospital that the child was confirmed to have been defiled,“ the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. “The case was reported at the police station and the father of the baby was arrested,” the prosecutor told the court. The case continues on Feb. 27.
