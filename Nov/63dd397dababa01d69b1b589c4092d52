 THERE was confusion in Mahuta Community, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna metropolis at the weekend, as kidnappers of Dr Adamu Chinoko, a lecturer at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, held a brother of the lecturer who took N2m ransom to the kidnappers. The kidnappers initially demanded N10 million to free the lecturer who was abducted last Thursday. After much appeal, the kidnappers agreed to collect N2m. The matter however became complicated on Sunday, as the victims brother, Dr Umar, also a lecturer with Kaduna Polytechnic who went to pay the N2m ransom to the kidnappers, was held captive. Confirming the development to newsmen on Monday evening, spokesman of Kebbi Indigenes Association in Kaduna, Garba Muhammad, said the kidnappers were now demanding additional N5m. Muhammad said, “There was a twist to the incident on Sunday when Dr. Umar Chinoko, who acted as a ransom bearer went to deliver the N2m demanded by the abductors. “From there, he too was abducted and taken hostage by the kidnappers. “Dr. Umar Chinoko went to pay a ransom of N2m and a new motorbike the kidnappers demanded and he was held. “After they collected the ransom, they also held him hostage and demanded for additional N5m before they could be freed. “As I speak to you he is still with the abductors.” The spokesman also added that the representative of the Emir of Zuru, also known as Wakilin Zuru, was aware of the unfortunate incident. Police Public Relations Officer Yakubu Sabo could not speak on the incident on Monday evening. He told The Nation that he was going to get details on the incident and get back to our correspondent, but he never did at press time.
