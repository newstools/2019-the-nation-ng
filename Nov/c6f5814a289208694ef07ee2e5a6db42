 THE British global Airline, British Airways has partnered with leading Pan African financial institution, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc and announced a collaboration to reward loyal customers who are cardholders of the bank. The promo which will last for six months from November 2019, will see UBA customers getting significant discounts when they purchase their British Airways tickets using their UBA cards. Specifically, the promo  will allow customers to enjoy between 10% to 15% discount on ticket bought  for the period of the promo. The collaboration is aimed at increasing customer experience and satisfaction, while non-UBA customers only need to procure a card instantly from any UBA branch to enjoy the service. The General Manager, Corporate Bank Directorate, UBA, Mr Muyiwa Akinyemi, who expressed delight at the collaboration, noted that the promo between the two organisations was carefully thought out to ensure that loyal customers of the two institutions are duly rewarded, while ensuring that they also receive more value for their money. “UBA is excited to collaborate with one of the foremost Airlines in the world to run a promotion aimed at rewarding our cardholders and premium customers who will enjoy discounted tickets and other ancillary benefits such as loyalty points on the British Airways Executive Club.” It is interesting to note that the 10% to15% discount is exclusive of taxes and customers can use the award-winning LEO (Virtual) banker to book the British Airways tickets and utilise UBA cards to make the payments. The General Manager for British Airways in West Africa, Mr Kola Olayinka, noted that the airline is pleased to partner with the bank due to its huge customer base and wide branch network, adding that with the partnership, more customers will be able to enjoy the promo.  jillokeke@yahoo.com, 07069429757, 08158610847
