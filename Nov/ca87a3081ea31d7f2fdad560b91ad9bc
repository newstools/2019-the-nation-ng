James Azania, Lokoja The Kogi All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Campaign Council has alleged that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) are planning to dress thugs in falsely inscribed GYB/APC caps and jackets. The Chairman of the Media and Publicity Committee, of the APC campaign, Kingsley Fanwo, Tuesday, in a statement, said that intelligence report at their disposal indicate that the two opposition parties are in “evil connivance” in this respect. According to him: “The Social Democratic Party and the People’s Democratic Party have perfected plans to produce fez caps and jackets with the inscription of GYB and APC; which they will distribute to hoodlums and mercenaries imported from neighbouring states. “The hoodlums have been instructed by the SDP and the PDP to invade polling units and cause mayhem during the governorship election, to give the governor a bad name and to harp on that at the tribunal since they already know the governor will win the election, going by the massive acceptance by the people. “We urge security agencies to enhance security at the polling units to protect the franchise of the Kogi people. “The governorship election is not war, but an expression of the right of the Kogi people to elect their leader.”
