James Azania, Lokoja Senator Dino Melaye has said he would be approaching the election petition tribunal if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) fails to review the outcome of the November 16 Appeal Court ordered rerun. The INEC had returned the verdict of inconclusiveness following alleged electoral violence and malpractice that reportedly characterized the exercise. Melaye after casting his vote, in Aiyetoro-Gbedde, on Saturday, expressed dissatisfaction with the results declared by the INEC, describing the November 16 election as a fraud that will not stand. According to him: “What we have as result is fraud… a major fraud.”
