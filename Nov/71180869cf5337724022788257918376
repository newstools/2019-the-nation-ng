 SUPER Eagles’ Team media Officer (TNO) Toyin Ibitoye has yet canvassed  for  the importance of quality education for athletes. This much he said at the 29th Lagos State University Student Union (LASUSU)  Sports Conference held at the school’s premises in Lagos. Speaking  with NationSport on the fringe of the event, Ibitoye emphasized the positive impact of Sports on academic performances in today’s tertiary schools; even as he commended the organisers. “I think it’s a fantastic idea, sports has a lot of benefits, being an active sports man has a lot of advantages and then being educated is like an icing on the cake, there can only be one outcome if you combine all this together you can only be a winner,” the ace sport journalist said. “It’s an amazing program and is happy that I am part of it and am hopeful a few students can pick a few out of it and be better. For those who are already active in Sports, I hope the education you’re able to acquire will help you stay useful many years after,” he added. The benefit of digitalization in today’s sporting world was also highlighted, using the La Liga Model presented by the Head Media Communications, La Liga Nigeria, Ayodeji Adegbenro. He said digital has helped sports in moving advanced and that we need to evolve with digitalization. In his own contribution the , 29th  LASUSU Sports Director, Akinola Olawale said the initiative was instructive:  “The decision to organise this conference is not farfetched, I have been participating in School sports ever since I got an admission into Lagos State University but  by the time we organized inter school faculty games, I realized we have different talented student on campus.”
