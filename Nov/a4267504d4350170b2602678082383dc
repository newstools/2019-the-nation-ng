Fans have continued to praise singer Teni Akpata and veteran television host, Frank Edoho for the newly released video for ‘Billionaire’. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the video, which was released on Thursday, quickly garnered positive response as fans described the concept as nostalgic. Starring cameos from comedian, Broda Shaggi, ‘Billionaire’ video is a parody of defunct hit television show, ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’. Appearing as ‘Who Wants to Be a Billionaire’ in the video, Edoho returned to host, reining in his legendary hosting skills and the suspense he earned the limelight with. In the video, Teni sits as a contestant, playing to win one billion while her song plays in the background. Set in the 90s, the TG Omori-directed flick also featured actress, Tina Mba and a host of extras who played Teni’s support club and cheering as she won. Since the video’s premiere, fans have taken to social media to commend the return of Edoho to host as parody of his hit show as well as Broda Shaggi’s hilarious take on the winning question. @Ugbedeojo wrote, “Teni’s ‘Billionaire’ video is so nice.
