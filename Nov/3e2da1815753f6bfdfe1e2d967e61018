INSURANCE companies need to reorganise their operations and focus on promoting value to deepen penetration, the President Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), Eddie Efekoha has said. He spoke during the opening of the Institute’s 2019 Annual Education Seminar with theme: “Financial Inclusion and Insurance – Issues, Challenges and opportunities” in Enugu State. Efekoha who is also the Managing Director of Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc said the theme was specially selected to throw further light on the importance of inclusion, the roles of emerging markets and need for creativity in the offering of services by insurance stakeholders in order  to grow the insurance industry. He stated that it is common knowledge that insurance penetration is nowhere near where it should be in the country. He pointed out that as practitioners, they can also acknowledge that companies are doing all that they can within the law to reach out to customers in order to create a sustained demand for insurance products. He said the question rather is whether the practitioners are putting in their best efforts and what more can be done to improve their lot. He said: “Equally, insurance companies are being tasked to reorganise their operations and focus on promoting value. This will in turn increase the number of persons who embrace insurance, turning them into ambassadors no matter in what sector they actively function. “This seminar theme beams a spotlight on financial inclusion as a major facilitator of the growth of the industry. Even the smallest molecule of our operations should be clear and concise to our target audience and our messages should reach them where ever they are.”
