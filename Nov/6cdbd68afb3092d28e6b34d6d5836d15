Another set of 30 young graduates is ready to gain first-hand work experience and employment opportunity in the corporate world, under the fourth First City Monument Bank (FCMB) internship programme and contest, tagged #FCMBFlexxtern. The participants, who are between 16 and 25, emerged victorious in an online contest organised by the bank as part of its youth engagement, capacity building and reward initiatives. This brings to 50, the number of winners produced by the #FCMBFlexxtern initiative since it was launched in 2016. The latest winners (Flexxterns) were inaugurated and presented with certificates at an event in Lagos. Each of them will get a three-month paid internship and career building experience with either FCMB or one of the organisations partnering with the bank on this capacity building initiative. The beneficiaries also stand a chance of being retained for full employment at the end of their respective internships. The event provided an opportunity to meet the Flexxterns and introduce them to the organisations they would respectively work with. At the event were representatives of the partner organisations, such as Insight Publicis, Terragon Group, Digiengage and TISV Digital. Other partners were 618 Bees, Lumenave, Sagerock & Associates, Vas2Net, School Kits Limited, Dmastermind and Wetherheads. FCMBâ€™s Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Diran Olojo, expressed delight at the quality of entries received from contestants and the passion that youths demonstrate when given the right opportunity to positively express themselves. Also commenting, the Group Head, Consumer Liability and Segment Management of FCMB, Mr. Shamsideen Fashola, said the Bank recognises the role of youths in building, shaping and driving economic growth.
