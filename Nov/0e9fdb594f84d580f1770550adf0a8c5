In a real estate industry largely dominated by men, Lulu Ugwuegbulam is gradually carving a niche for herself. Last year, she won the Realtor of the year 2018, which came with a car. Recently too, she bagged an all-expense paid trip to Dubai courtesy of Gracias Global Properties. She will go on the trip this month. Although the pretty woman only ventured into the real estate business when she realised that a lot of Nigerians were ignorant of how it works, she has undoubtedly made her impact felt. Ugwuegbulam said: “I am excited about the recognition I have received so far even though I am just two year’s old in the business. It shows that all my hard work has not been in vain. My major desire is to help people get affordable properties. I realise many people have the erroneous conclusion that you must be super rich before you own land or house. I have been educating people, trying to convince them that they can always start from somewhere.” A graduate of Business Administration from the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Ugwuegbulam was born in Warri, Delta, but moved to Port Harcourt for her secondary school education. She later moved to Lagos in 2009.
