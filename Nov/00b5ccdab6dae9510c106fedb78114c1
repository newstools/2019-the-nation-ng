The new Lagos Police Commissioner Olusegun Odumosu has appealed to residents to partner security agencies  for effective crime prevention in the state. Odumosu spoke while taking over the command from his predecessor Zubairu Muazu, an Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG). He assured that the command would sustain community policing strategies, adding that his men  would respect the rights of Lagosians. Odumosu’s pledge to ensure that police respect human rights is coming at a time of public outcry against alleged human rights infractions. The police chief also vowed to ensure divisional police officers were on the field at all times, stressing he would not tolerate desk policing. “My mission is to fight crime to standstill, protect lives and properties. I am a believer of community policing. We are going to involve the citizens in the war against crime through community policing. “We will keep our officers on their toes because I am here to fight crime. I cannot be awake while my officers are sleeping. I will not take it. My officers must be awake with me. “We are going to improve on what our predecessors did especially the  outgoing AIG Zubairu Muazu,” he said.
