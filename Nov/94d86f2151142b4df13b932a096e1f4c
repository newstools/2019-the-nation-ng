By Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi  With the premiere of Belinda Effiah’s new movie, Miracle, last Monday, at the University of Lagos, Paul Iremide, a student, has won the maiden Miracle Challenge contest’s N50,000 grant. The grant was made possible by comedian, singer and actress Chioma Omeruah, known as Chigul. The actress on her Instagram handle threw the challenge to students, with a promise that 10 to 20 students will win scholarships worth 50 to N100,000. Appreciating Chigul for her support, she wrote, “How do you begin to thank a lady with such a large heart @theonlychigul. I approached you at an event recently; told you about #miraclethefilm premiere and the giveback and you not only jumped at it – you supported by giving one student N50,000 grant. I am so honoured and grateful. You showed up on time and helped encourage the students with your goodwill message. God bless your kind heart – your type is rare. “So, one University of Lagos student will win the N50,000 grant from @theonlychigul. ‘’The winner for this grant is Paul Iremide, that is because you partook of the Miracle Challenge and you deserve to win.” The movie, which the actress noted, took over five years to complete, was directed by Pascal Amanfo. It stars Beverly Naya, Shawn Faqua, Eniola Badmus, Biola Segun-Williams, Emeka Rollas, Nicole Ndigwe, MC Abbey, Beverly Oh, Uche Chidulo and Musa Ibro.
