Our Reporter  Ekiti State Government has approved the appointment of Prince James Olugbesoye as the Oluloro of Iloro-Ekiti in Ijero Local Government. The News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) reports that Olugbesoye, who was born on July 25, 1963, is from the Arojojoye ruling house. A statement issued by Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi said that the appointment, which was with immediate effect, was in line with the provisions of the Chiefs Law, Cap C5, Law of Ekiti State, 2002. It said the state Executive Council, at its meeting held on October 30, had considered and approved Olugbesoye’s nomination as the new Oluloro. NAN recalls that the throne had become vacant after the demise of Oba Michael Arowolo of Arowolo ruling house on May 16, 2015. Consequently, the Bureau of Chieftaincy Affairs, in a letter dated October 2, 2015, had directed the Ijero Local Government Council to put necessary machinery in motion for the Arojojoye ruling house, which was the next to fill the vacant stool. The three candidates, who vied for the royal stool, were Prince James Olugbesoye, Prince Adebayo Fajuyigbe and Prince Olowookere Samuel. The three ruling houses in Iloro-Ekiti are Arowolo, Arojojoye and Orubuloye, which are recognised by the Iloro-Ekiti Chieftaincy Declaration. The town’s six kingmakers had conducted extensive investigations and consultations to determine the suitability of each of the candidates for the vacant stool, the outcome of which was discussed at a meeting held on September 9, 2019. At the meeting, which had the kingmakers, the Arojojoye ruling house and the candidates in attendance, it was unanimously agreed that Olugbesoye be presented as the new Oluloro. NAN reports that the memorandum of the state Executive Council approving Olugbesoye’s appointment had been cleared by the Ministry of Justice with Governor Kayode Fayemi. The council has also authorised the publication of the legal notice in the state government’s gazette.
