When constituents don’t benefit from constituency projects, who benefits? The answer to this question may well shed light on why Nigeria remains underdeveloped.  President Muhammadu Buhari has demonstrated that the issue is a cause for concern. By backing a probe of those who contributed to the country’s underdevelopment through failed constituency projects, Buhari introduced another dimension to his administration’s anti-corruption effort. At the opening of the National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in Public Sector on November 19, Buhari observed that funds for constituency projects “didn’t produce results,” and supported an investigation by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). Buhari said:  ‘‘It is on record that in the past 10 years One trillion naira (N1 trillion) has been appropriated for constituency projects, yet the impact of such huge spending on the lives and welfare of ordinary Nigerians can hardly be seen. ‘‘The first phase report of tracking these projects by ICPC confirms our worst fears that people at the grassroots have not benefited in terms commensurate with the huge sums appropriated for constituency projects since inception. ‘‘I am, therefore, delighted that through the effort of ICPC, some contractors are returning to site to execute projects hitherto abandoned and that project sponsors are being held to account. ‘‘The ICPC has my full support and the support of this government to hold fully to account contractors, complicit public servants and project sponsors who divert funds meant for constituencies, or other people-oriented welfare projects of our government, or who by other means, reduce the quality and value of such projects meant for our people.’’ Importantly, in June the ICPC had launched an investigation into N900b constituency projects in states. The probe seeks to verify constituency projects executed by immediate past senators and members of the House of Representatives in the 8th National Assembly between 2015 and 2018. The verification involves 180 key projects in the 36 states, with at least five projects identified for tracking in each state. The first phase will be conducted in 12 states across the six geo-political zones of the country: Kogi and Benue (North-Central); Adamawa and Bauchi (North-East); Sokoto and Kano (North-West); Imo and Enugu (South-East); Lagos and Osun (South-West); and Akwa Ibom and Edo (South-South). A report said the commission “will make recoveries on projects/contracts confirmed to have been inflated or in which contractors underperformed or did not perform at all.”  ICPC Chairman Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye said: “The level of implementation of constituency projects in 16 focus states for 2015 is revealing. Out of 436 constituency projects for the year that were tracked, 145 were completed, 77 ongoing while 211 were not executed at all. For 2016, out of a total of 852 constituency projects in 20 states in the 2016 Budget that were tracked, 350 were completed, 118 were ongoing, 41 locations not specified in the budget and 343 not done or performed. In 2017, a total of 1,228 constituency projects in the budget were tracked for performance as at June 2018. Out of these, 478 were completed, 173 in unspecified location, 200 ongoing, 13 abandoned and 364 not started. The level of performance of constituency projects is therefore disputable.” In summary, about 2,516 projects were tracked between 2015 and 2017; 918 were not done, 395 were ongoing and 214 could not be located. Owasanoye added: “Constituency projects are intended to be developmental, such as provision of water, rural electrification, rural clinics, schools, community centres and bursary for indigent students. In the light of annual budgetary allocations to constituency projects and based on actual releases by the government, it is firmly believed that the impact of constituency projects on the lives of ordinary Nigerians ought to be more visible…The concern is that in Nigeria, rather than address the needs of constituents, many constituency projects have become avenues of corruption.” It is ironic that the beneficiaries of constituency projects are usually not constituents, but corrupt federal legislators and their associates. It is expected that constituents would demand explanations from their representatives. Members of the National Assembly are embarrassed. But their embarrassment is beside the point. Interestingly, they offered a defence that wasn’t a defence. For instance, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila argued that the ICPC report that informed Buhari’s position missed the point by failing to distinguish between budgeted funds and released funds. Gbajabiamila was quoted as saying:  “I think it is a breach of our collective privilege as a house and not one person. My concern is the unintended consequences of words spoken. These are words emanating from a report by ICPC. There could be unintended consequences that could come out of it. You put people’s wellbeing at risk.” He added:  “The ICPC could easily invoke their power of investigation and look at releases as compared to what was budgeted… I will use this medium to send this message across to ICPC and other agencies to do their work of investigation well. There is a difference between money budgeted and money released. It is as simple as ABC.” Gbajabiamila’s argument, which represents the position of members of the National Assembly, is simplistic and self-serving. The suggestion that the ICPC report exposes the lawmakers to attacks by their constituents is alarmist and downplays the facts of the matter. Beyond budgeted funds, there were actual released funds, which didn’t change the picture of large-scale underperformance that contributed to the country’s underdevelopment. If the ICPC found out that out of about 2, 516 constituency projects tracked between 2015 and 2017, 918 were not done, 395 were ongoing and 214 could not be located, it is possible that funds were not released for the projects not done. But is that the case? Concerning the 395 ongoing projects, is it the case that funds for completion were not released? What about the 214 projects that could not be located? Why could they not be located? Are they real projects or unreal projects? Were budgeted funds released for these projects that could not be located? It is scandalous that such projects which are supposed to develop constituencies, and thereby develop the country, are mostly con jobs.
