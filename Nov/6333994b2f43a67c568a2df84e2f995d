Police in Ogun State have arrested 42-year-old Temitope Akinola for poisoning her granddaughter. Akinola was said to have killed the two-day-old because of her dislike for her son-in-law, the child’s father. It was gathered that she committed the alleged offence on Thursday while the baby’s mother was having her bath at their residence in Isote, Shagamu. Akinola was said to be the only one with the child when the mother went for a bath, only to return to find her  body lifeless. Police said the woman confessed to killing the child because she loathed the thought of her daughter marrying the baby’s father. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said in a statement that the woman confessed how she tried to terminate her daughter’s pregnancy when she learnt about it but was warned by her pastor to desist. “She waited for her to give birth before carrying out her devilish intention. She explained further that she poisoned the baby with a deadly insecticide known as sniper. “The body of the baby has been deposited at Olabisi Onabanjo Teaching Hospital mortuary. The suspect has been transferred to homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation and prosecution,” he said.
