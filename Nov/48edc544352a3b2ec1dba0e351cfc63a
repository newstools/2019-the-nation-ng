Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja  The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said the late Prof. Tam David-West would best be remembered as a Nigerian who served his country diligently and championed the cause of the underprivileged. The party, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, recalled the contributions of the departed erudite Professor of Virology and one-time Minister of and Energy, especially during the national debate on ending petroleum products’ subsidy. It noted that the passage of Prof. David-West had depleted the rank of the progressives in the country, especially one who was never afraid to speak the truth to those occupying positions of authority. “The All Progressives Congress (APC) mourns the death of Prof. Tam David-West who served as Minister of Petroleum and Energy and also Minister of Mines, Power and Steel. “Indeed, Nigeria has lost a progressive voice and social critic who spoke truth to power. An erudite scholar, the late Tam David-West always held our leaders to account on issues of good governance. “We recall his strong advocacy for oil sector reforms, particularly the passage of a mutually-beneficial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), fixing moribund refineries and ending the fuel subsidy racket that was a drainpipe on the country’s resources before the advent of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. “While the death of the late patriot is painful and a sad loss, we take solace with the fact that he lived an accomplished and impactful life. In death, we remember and celebrate a man who served the country diligently and championed the cause of the poor and underprivileged. The party condoles with the late Tam David-West family members, friends, colleagues, the people and government of Rivers State. We pray the Almighty God gives them the strength to bear the loss”, the statement said.
