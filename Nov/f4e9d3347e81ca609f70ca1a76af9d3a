Veteran actor, producer and director, Prince Jide Kosoko, has floated a voluntary grassroots environment, health and security advocacy and support group, Environment Monitoring Volunteers. Kosoko, who was appointed an Environment Ambassador of Lagos State on 5th of June, 2009 by the then state governor, Babatunde Raji Fashola, in an interview with journalists in Lagos, said the Environment Monitoring Volunteers, is a voluntary group that will bring together thousands of Nigerians who are passionate about clean, safe, healthy and secure environment. Kosoko said: “The group seeks to liaise with government at all levels through relevant agencies in helping to instil the culture of cleanliness, proper care for the environment, healthy practices and ensuring that our communities are safe and secure.” Speaking further, he said the group seeks to carry out its objectives from the ward level through education, enlightenment and serving as “brothers’ keepers”, by giving timely information to security agencies on suspicious activities and persons. Kosoko, a direct descendant of King Kosoko of Lagos, explained that he had been actively involved in environmental issues for the past 10 years when Fashola appointed him an Environment Ambassador. According to him, his active involvement in environmental issues led the United Nations Children and Education Fund (UNICEF) to commission him to produce and direct an environmental issue-based docu-drama titled Battle for Life. “We shall coordinate periodic voluntary clean up exercises in markets, motor parks and other public places. “We are already in talks with different organisations, including government, for partnership and collaboration on the task ahead and fortunately, the feedbacks have been encouraging,” the thespian concluded.
