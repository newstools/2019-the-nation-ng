From Bassey Anthony, Uyo Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly yesterday demanded an investigation into the murder of one Godwin Thomas, said to be a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Thomas was shot dead last Thursday at Ndiya Ikot Ukab in Nsit Ubium Local Government Area by a yet to be identified police officer. The member representing Etinan State Constituency, Aniefiok Dennis, said the deceased was an ardent supporter of the PDP in the state and wondered why he was gruesomely killed for no reason. The lawmaker described the deceased as a struggling young man, who was killed, leaving behind a wife, three-year-old daughter, mother and father to cater for. He urged the House to help to uncover his killers.  “We want proper investigation to be carried out by relevant authorities to uncover whoever is behind the killing of Mr. Godwin Thomas and to ensure that no other person is killed in the state, unjustly,” he said. Speaker of the House,  Aniekan Bassey, condemned the killing and maintained the House would employ all legal means to bring the perpetrators of the crime before the law. “It is a very unfortunate situation. We will do all we can, within our powers to uncover the killer. That is what we were elected to do. The police have issued a statement, likewise the state government. We (the House of Assembly) hereby condemn the torture and killing of Mr. Godwin Thomas. We will do our part in this case”, he said. The Speaker, therefore, directed the House Committee on Security to interface with the state Police Command and other relevant security agencies to investigate the matter and ensure the arrest and prosecution of the culprits.
