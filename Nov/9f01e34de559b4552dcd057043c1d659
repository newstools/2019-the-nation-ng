Osagie Otabor, Bénin Managing Director of Okomu Oil plc, Dr. Graham Heifer, has described the closure of borders as the best policy of the Federal Government as it has helped him to sell more products. Dr. Heifer stated that the unmitigated illegal importation of palm oil caused a lot of logjam for his business. He spoke to newsmen after receiving the certification by the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for palm oil producers. Heifer stated that the border closure has helped him to move products to the market. He said: “The border closure has assisted us. Before then, there was unmitigated illegal importation of oil palm. When they closed the borders, it removed the logjam which we are grateful for. “It has helped us to move our product to the market. You know if our product stayed long, it might get old and people would not want it. That has helped us a lot. In terms of pricing pricing in it is better we move our products to sell it than the pricing.” On the RSPO certification, Dr. Heifer said the internationally recognised certification audit was made possible by the enabling environment created by the Edo state government for the company to operate. “The RSPO makes sure that the people that are working here have a very good living condition not just business but equitable and sustainable economic environment. “It is making sure the company is not destroying the relationship with the people and if there are issues how does the company respond. “It is a fully sustainable programme that allow the government as well to understand that this is an international recognised certificated scheme and the people in the communities are happy. This is good for the company and the government. “They like to see companies like us here with RSPO because everything will be working according to international laws.”
