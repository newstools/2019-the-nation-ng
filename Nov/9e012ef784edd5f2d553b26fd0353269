THE Lagos State Government (LASG) has directed operators of hotels, leisure homes and religious centres shut down due to noise pollution to obtain guarantees from residents associations before they can be reopened. Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, gave the directive in a statement on Wednesday. Bello said that on a continuous basis, LASEPA officials would be going round such centres and homes and anyone found to have exceeded the allowed level of sound output would be closed down and appropriate sanctions applied. The commissioner noted that his office had been inundated with complaints and petitions from many residents and residents’ associations about the obnoxious noise levels of many of the leisure centres and religious homes. “It was also discovered that many of such leisure centres and religious homes, nightclubs, after being reopened by the state government usually go back to the same noise pollution for which they were earlier shut. “This action prompted the issue of involving the residents’ associations. The affected leisure centres should procure soundproof equipment which would lessen the decibel of sound that goes out when such leisure or religious homes are engaging in business,” Bello said.
