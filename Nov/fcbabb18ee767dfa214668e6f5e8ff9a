A German-based  evangelist, Mrs. Gift Chidinma Nnamoko, has advised youths to redirect their energy in seeking white collar jobs to discovering their God-given talents and creating employment for themselves. Mrs.Nnamoko, who has motivated youths into various spheres of positive engagements across the country, through talk shows and editorial materials, said the perception by a section of people that Africa remains a continent riddled with poverty and diseases was misleading. Speaking on her new book The Beauty of Unemployment, Mrs. Nnamoko said she published the book as part of her numerous approaches to curbing youth restiveness by reminding them of the need to engage themselves in areas their talents can bring out the best in them. She said the book would be unveiled alongside a magazine, Wear Africa, as well as presentation of awards to some young entrepreneurs on November 19, at the Oriental Hotel in Lagos. She said:  “Who says Africa is only a continent where you find poverty, war, and diseases? As much as you have the bad and the ugly, you also have the good.  If you are fixated on the negatives of life there is no doubt that you will miss the big picture.  “In my journey as an entrepreneur, I believe there are ‘blessings’ that come with being unemployed. Many youths have given up just because they are without paid job. There is still good news for you. Why spend all your life waiting to be employed when you can actually become an entrepreneur? I have also met lots of successful businessmen and other professionals who are on top of their careers.”  “They started out on their own, some of them never having applied for paid jobs. This is not to say that they didn’t face challenges associated with doing business in Africa. I assume they may have found ways to cope with power outages and infrastructural deficits. Despite the challenges, these acquaintances of mine are glad to find themselves in Africa at a time opportunities are springing up everywhere.”
