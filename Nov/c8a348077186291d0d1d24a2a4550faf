Less than two weeks to the governorship and Kogi West Senatorial elections, a group, Kogi Coalition of Umbrella  Development Associations (KOCUDA), has called on the electorate to give room for peaceful elections. KOCUDA is made up of the Igala Cultural and Development Association (ICDA), headed by Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq; Ebira Peoples Association (EPW) led by Dr. Adeiza and Okun Development Association (ODA) led by Femi Mikikan. The group during a press conference yesterday in Lokoja said the forthcoming governorship election should not be allowed to degenerate into anarchy, as no meaningful development could take place in a violent atmosphere. They explained that the aim of forming the association was to douse the tension caused by ethnic polarisation and animosities that had always bedeviled the state at every turn of election. They said it was instructive for leaders of thought to start thinking of the future of the state. “Ethnic nationalism and mediocrity have become blind to our development and peace. Coming together, therefore, is an attempt to redirect our focus on development,” they said. Mikikan said the objective of KOCUDA was to complement the efforts of the state government and other bodies in the state in consolidating the gains so far recorded in promoting peace, unity and understanding across the geographical divides of the state. According to him: “This becomes even more imperative if we bear in mind that these associations; EPA, ICDA and ODA truly represent the aggregate interests and aspirations of their people.”
