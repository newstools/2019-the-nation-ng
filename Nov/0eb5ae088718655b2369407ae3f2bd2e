Lagos State Deputy Governor Kadri Obafemi Hamzat has inaugurated two schools, library, Information Communication Technology (ICT) centre and sporting facilities at the Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government. The schools are St. Mary Model Nursery/Primary School; Fr. Sadiku Memorial Nursery/Primary School; Oba Abdul-Fatai Aromire Library; and ICT Centre aa well as Basketball Ball Court. Hamzat said the government placed high priority on education, adding that children should be educated in good environments. He hailed the council Chairman, Fatai Adekunle Ayoola for the achievement. The deputy governor said “what is important for us is education and it is fundamental to the development of the state.” The government, he said, approved the procurement of tablets for teachers to aid understanding and improve teaching skills. “Education is one of the most important thing we must do as a society, we cannot afford to have functional illiterates, it is essential to have children that are well educated in a good environment. I thank the chairman of this local government for taking this initiative,” he said. Earlier, Ayoola stressed his administration was passionate about development among adolescents, hence its resolve to provide comfortable learning environments. He emphasised his commitment to transform communities in the council as part of a greater Lagos. “It’s obvious that in order to create a sustainable future for the masses, we have to invest in the children who are usually referred to as the future leaders,” he said. Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government, he said, is in dire need of basic social amenities, such as good roads, quality health care service delivery, state of the art public schools with modern equipment and empowerment programmes that would develop our youths and liberate our women. “These requests are expedient at this juncture because the council does not have commissioner as a representative in the Lagos State exco,” he said.
