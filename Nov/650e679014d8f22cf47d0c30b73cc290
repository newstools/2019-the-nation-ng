 COMMUNICATION and Digital Economy Minister Isa Ali Pantami has extended the deadline given to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), on the reduction of data prices in the country. The Minister had issued a five day ultimatum to the regulatory body to meet with other stakeholders for the purpose of reviewing downward the prices of data in the country. He had argued that his office was inundated with complaints from concerned Nigerians about the high cost of data compared with countries with lesser population. However in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, the Minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman, said the ministry had received NCC’s letter that action was being taken on the matter. According to him, the NCC also “assured the Minister that it has been working assiduously round the clock to enforce the Federal Government’s directives and has requested the good graces of the Minister to extend the deadline which expires today, 8th November 2019, to enable it properly re-strategise and fully implement long term solutions as directed, to the challenges. “Dr Pantami has graciously granted an extension with the understanding that the Commission will resolve these issues within the shortest time possible. “The Minister, hereby assures the general public that the current administration will neither tolerate acts of injustice nor the short changing of its citizens as it is working tirelessly to ensure that subscribers get full value for their money.”
