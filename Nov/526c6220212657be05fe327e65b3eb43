Scotland beat Cyprus 2-1 to go third in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I. Ryan Christie opened the scoring for Scotland in the first half with a strike into the top corner. Georgios Efrem then equalised for Cyprus with a stunning volley only a minute into the second period. The home side were level for just six minutes though as John McGinn flicked Scotland in front for the second time in the match. Cyprus couldnâ€™t find a second equaliser and the match finished 2-1. Scotland came into their penultimate Group I game knowing they could no longer qualify for Euro 2020 through their group, but would have been looking to claim third spot nonetheless. But it was Cyprus who had the first real chance of the game with just five minutes on the clock. Some neat exchanges on the edge of the Cyprus led to Georgios Efrem striking the crossbar with a right-footed effort. The ball appeared the cross the line but the referee failed to signal for a goal. Replays showed the entire ball was clearly over all of the line and had goal-line technology been in place for the game, Cyprus would have been 1-0 up. Just six minutes later and the away side were ahead. Christie found the top corner with a stunning, curling effort that gave Cyprus goalkeeper Urko Pardo with no chance. The game was by no means over. Pieros Sotiriou looked dangerous in attack and his low effort had to be beaten away by Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall.
