Writing is tedious but certain people have made it look like a piece of cake. A governorship aspirant and a one-time member of the House of Representative, Hon. Femi Kehinde, belongs to this breed of humans. To celebrate his 60th birthday, he launched his latest book, ‘A Short Stroll Along History Avenue,’ at the Jogor Event Center, Ibadan. Finding time to put all his thoughts in a book is admirable for a busy man. Chairman of the day, Mr. Benedict Alabi, described the celebrant as a man who has a lot to offer the society. He urged him to continue to bring history closer to the present through his writing. Also spotted at the ceremony was the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi and Justice Oladiran Akintola.
