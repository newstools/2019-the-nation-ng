 ACCESS Bank Plc has commenced its 2019 week-long Sustainability Awareness Week. The event was part of its efforts to raise awareness about the importance of sustainability within and outside the corporate environment. Through the awareness week, with the theme ‘Together for a Sustainable Future’, the bank seeks to reinforce its identity as a sustainability leader in Nigeria, while also ensuring that everyone is informed of their individual roles in contributing towards positive development. With sustainability enshrined in all the Bank’s operations, its Group Managing Director, Herbert Wigwe, has said the Week will be a celebration of all its successes and also serve as a building block to achieve better results in the coming years. “At Access Bank, sustainability principles form the bedrock of all our banking and non-banking activities. Thus far, our yearly results have validated this approach, as we are now among the top three most profitable banks in Nigeria. This week, we will be celebrating these successes, charging and re-educating our employees on global best practices, while also creating awareness about what needs to be done to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030,” he said.
