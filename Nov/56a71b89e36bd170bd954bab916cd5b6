The Lagos State government has trained its operational officials for the 2019 pilgrimage to Jerusalem in Israel. Speaking at the event held at the Chapel of Christ the Light, Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Ministry of Home Affairs, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile Yussuf urged the operatives to be good representatives of the state and ensure a hitch-free pilgrimage. Akinbile-Yussuf noted that the job of operation was demanding and tasking, urging the officials to be watchful and vigilant, warning that no intending pilgrims should abscond under their watch. She explained that the pilgrimage would be in three batches and all pilgrims irrespective of their batch would be given equal treatment. She said: “Our going to the Holy land is to work and ensure we demonstrate the glory of Lagos State. To take proper care of pilgrims by giving them moral support and also to train the minds of the people to always patronise Lagos State over again.” The Executive Secretary of Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board (LSCPWB), Mrs Florence Gbafe said: “With the level of training, morale and operational tips taught by facilitators, who are well experienced in the pilgrimage exercise, success of the exercise is assured.” Earlier, the presiding chaplain of the Chapel of Christ the Light, the Very Rev. Ayo Olu Oyadotun advised the operational personnel to have a heart of thanksgiving, appreciating God for the privilege to serve.
