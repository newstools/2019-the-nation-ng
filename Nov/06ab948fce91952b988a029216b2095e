 Plateau State has started early preparations towards a successful hosting of the 2020 edition of the National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST). The North-central state has been designated the next host of NAFEST by the National Council for Arts and Culture which is the government agency in charge of promoting culture and the living arts in Nigeria. A delegation from the state  led by Tourism, Culture and Hospitality Commissioner  Tamwakat Weli visited the Director-General of NCAC, Otunba Segun Runsewe in Abuja, expressing the full commitment of the state towards hosting the best NAFEST ever. Plateau,Weli said,is blessed with friendly weather, peaceful people and a scenic beauty. He  urged Nigerians and foreigners to use the opportunity to savour the hospitality the state has to offer. Otunba Runsewe described   Governor Solomon Lalong of Plateau State as  a culture-friendly Governor who has the interest of his people at heart with his developmental initiatives aimed at building bridges of peace and harmony across the Plateau. Runsewe said the council will work with the state to ensure a successful hosting of NAFEST next year saying Plateau state meets all the criteria necessary to host the event. Fielding questions from journalists with regards to the budget earmarked for NAFEST 2020, the NCAC chief said no price tag should be placed in a program like NAFEST which is organised annually to enthrone peace and unity and also empower Nigerians thereby reducing crime. He was positive that Plateau State, which hosted the 1996 edition will stage the mother of all NAFEST this time around giving the interest of the state government together with the support of the federal government and other industry stakeholders.
