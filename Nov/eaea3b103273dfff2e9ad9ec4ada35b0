 A UNIQUE opportunity for the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Edo State Governor Pius Obaseki to end their rift went up in smoke on Thursday. Invitations were extended to the warring parties for the meeting of South-South leaders in Abuja where it was hoped that their differences could be settled, but the Obaseki’s camp declined the invitation. The Governor’s camp chose not to attend the meeting on the ground that it would hold in Oshiomhole’s house and that would defeat the principle of neutrality in dispute resolution. Though the governor and his people were said to have attended similar meetings in the same house, the governor’s handlers say that cannot be now as the relationship between both leaders have broken down irredeemably. Efforts of a reconciliation committee previously constituted by the party equally came to nought. No doubt about it, Edo will be a battleground in 2020.
