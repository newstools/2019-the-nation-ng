By Sanni Onogu, Abuja Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidates on their victory in the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. Lawan in a statement by Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, particularly rejoiced with the Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello on his re-election and David Lyon for making history as the first governor Bayelsa has elected on a platform different from the outgoing ruling party in the state. He lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring a level playing field that enabled the people to assert their sovereignty and choose their leaders. “The impressive turnout of voters in the two states is a ringing endorsement of democracy by Nigerians as their preferred system,  notwithstanding its current challenges,” Lawan said.  Lawan also thanked the security personnel for their sacrifices for peace and order in the face of great difficulties. The Senate President enjoined the winners to be magnanimous in victory by accommodating all sections of the state in their governments and development agenda. Lawan also admonished the electoral umpire to learn from the challenges experienced in the two states with a view to constantly improving its institutional performance and the electoral process. The Senate President called on the relevant agencies to ensure thorough prosecution of the electoral offenders in the two states to serve as a deterrence to others.
