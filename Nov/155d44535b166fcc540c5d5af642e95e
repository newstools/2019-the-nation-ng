Augustine Ehikioya, Abuja  President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated most warmly, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the November 16 election in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, on his impressive victory. Buhari, according to a statement in the early hours of Monday by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, also commended APC supporters in particular and Nigerians in general in the State who exercised their civic rights in a peaceful manner, notwithstanding the pockets of unrest recorded in some locations. Condemning the loss of lives in Bayelsa, particularly prior to the election, the President commiserated with the families of the victims. Buhari said ‘‘Violence during elections vitiates our commitment to demonstrate to the world and upcoming generation that we are a people capable of electing leaders in a peaceful and orderly manner.’’ Noting that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies did their best within the ambit of the law to ensure free, fair and credible elections, he said that it is unfortunate that pockets of unrest, mostly sponsored by desperate politicians, were recorded during the poll. He looked forward to working with the incoming government to improve the lives of the people in Bayelsa State, while ensuring the security of lives and property of all citizens. President Buhari urged Governor-elect Lyon to carry other divergent interests along in the next phase of governance. He implored those not satisfied with the outcome of the poll to seek redress through the constitutionally established channels.
