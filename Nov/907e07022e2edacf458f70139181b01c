D’Tigress Centre Evelyn Akhator says qualification for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo is a lifelong dream that must come through. Speaking from The 2019 FIBA Afrobasket winner said Olympics qualification and an outstanding performance is the height of any professional sports man in the national colours. “It is really important that we qualify,” Akhator  said from  her base in Salamanca where she plies her trade with CB Avenida,“ It is the big deal because it is the biggest in the world. It is a big deal for me to be at my first Olympics. I will love to go and experience it. It will be a huge achievement to go to the Olympics, not just going there but going there to make history”. Akhator said Belgium or France would be her destination of choice for the OQT while remaining optimistic about the team’s chances of picking one of the 10 tickets on offer from the OQT. “With respect to all the 16 teams, I will possibly love to meet Great Britain, Serbia, maybe Belgium, Spain, Sweden, China and Mozambique in the qualifiers which I believe could brighten our chances of qualification.”
