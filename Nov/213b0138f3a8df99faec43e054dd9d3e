The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) top scorer, Odion Ighalo has warned the Eagles about threat the Squirrels of Benin Republic could pose to the Nigerians when both countries clash on Wednesday in Uyo in a Group L tie for the 2021 AFCON. The China-based striker who scored an impressive seven goals to help  Nigeria qualified for the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, said it would  be reckless to underrate the battle-hardened neighbours. The Beninese are no longer the Cinderella team of the past and as recent as June at the AFCON in Egypt, they drew with both Ghana (2-2) and Cameroon (0-0)  in their preliminary group match and sensationally dumped cup favourites Morocco in the Round of 16; only to lose by the odd 1-0 goal to eventual runner-up Senegal in the quarter finals. “I will advise them (Super Eagles) to take the game (against Benin)  serious because there is no small team in football anymore,” the Shanghai Greenland Shenhua who was top scorer with five goals at 2019 AFCON  said in an interview with NationSport. “To the young guys in the team, it’s time to show what they can do and I believe they will deliver.” The Super Eagles go into Wednesday’s battle against Benin without their talismanic striker who retired from international football after his goals helped Nigeria to win the bronze medal in Egypt. Meanwhile, when pressed about the likelihood to rescind his retirement decision: “Well you can never say never in life but for now, I’m facing my club football and wishing the guys all the best for the games . “How long can I go on playing? Only God knows, mine is to keep going till I can’t anymore,” he noted.
