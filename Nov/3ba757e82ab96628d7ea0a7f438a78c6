The Senate on Tuesday called on the Federal, State and Local Governments to construct more public toilets to curb the incidence of open defecation across the country. This appeal followed the adoption of a point of personal explanation moved by Senator Clifford Ordia who heads Local and Foreign Debt Committee as part of activities to mark this year’s World Toilet Day. The upper legislative chamber insisted that it is not enough to complain or acknowledge the growing case of open defecation, but action must be taken urgently to redress the situation. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, in his contribution said: “The government needs to provide the facilities if Nigerians must stop open defecation. Government needs to provide toilets in public places.” Senator Ordia in his personal explanation noted that open defection poses serious economic, social, health hazards effect on the people, community and the environment. An expert in water, sanitation and hygiene who works with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), Mr. Bioye Ogunjobi said Nigeria loses about 1.3 per cent of its GDP amounting to N455 billion annually due to poor sanitation and that a third of that cost is as a result of the practice of open defecation. Ordia said: “Besides the exposure to diseases, there is a lack of dignity that is inherent in open defecation practices, particularly with regard to women and girls. “If effective solutions are not found, the non-availability of sanitation facilities inadvertently further exposes women and girls to violence including rape, when they are forced to go out at night to defecate in the open. “The Ministry on Environment, Water Resources, Health and other related agencies should increase awareness and sensitisation on the dangers of open defecation.” He urged the Federal Government through its relevant agencies to increase the construction of public toilets round the 36 states especially in those states where open defecation is more prevalent.
