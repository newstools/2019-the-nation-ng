The governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states have come and gone, but the dust they raised may take some time to settle. A N3 billion largesse a governor doled out to some influential members of the party in Abuja is causing a stir as some aggrieved party members are clamouring for sanctions against the recipients of the said sum. Although it was difficult to know who got what, Sentry learnt that the errant party henchmen actually demanded for N6 billion to facilitate the victory of the party’s candidate but got N3 billion as advanced payment. It was not clear at press time whether the governor in question would be willing to pay the outstanding sum with the party’s loss of the election or demand a refund of the sum already paid. But it is more likely that the influential members would not get more than they have received even if they will not have to make a refund, because the governor who gave out the money is said to be peeved that the party’s National Working Committee has been “unduly quiet” about the results of the elections.
