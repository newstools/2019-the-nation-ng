Nineteen suspected land grabbers arrested by the Lagos State Special Taskforce on Land Grabbers (LSSTFLG) will appear in court soon, the Attorney General, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) has said. They included 18 men and a woman. Onigbanjo said on Thursday that they will be prosecuted for offences bothering on “trespassing, illegal occupation, forceful land take over and prevention of lawful of entry by violence”. They were arrested in a sting operation in connection with a land situated at Plot 1Block II, Ogudu Phase II Government Residential Scheme in Kosofe Local Government Area. The sting operation was carried out by officials of the LSSTFLG led by the Coordinator, Mr. Owolabi Arole and police men attached to State Taskforce on Environment and Special Offences Enforcement Unit. He disclosed that the arrested persons have been handed over to State Taskforce on Environment and Special Offences Enforcement Unit for prosecution at the Special Offences Court of Lagos State and will face a three-count charge bothering on land grabbing. A statement issued yesterday by the Principal Public Affairs Officer, LSSTLG, Bukola Bakare stated: “This arrest is culmination of investigation carried out by the Special Taskforce on Land Grabbers on a petition submitted by Harmonious Attorneys on behalf Mr. Ade Bamtefa, the petitioner and claimant of the land. “On receiving the petition, officials of the State Special Taskforce swung into action. “Both parties were invited for a meeting to establish the veracity or otherwise of the petition. “It was however discovered from our findings that the arrested persons result to self-help by not only trespassing on the land which had been cordoned-off with a ‘KEEP-OFF’ warning pending the conclusion of investigation but had also started erecting structures on the land. “This is unacceptable and contrary to some sections of the Property Protection Law, 2016”, Onigbanjo said.
