 COMMISSIONER of Police, Kogi State Command, Mr. Hakeem Busari, on Tuesday said the command will provide adequate security to enable the electorate to vote in the state’s November 16 governorship election. This is just as the state council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in conjunction with a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Search for Common Ground, staged a “Media Peace Day” in Lokoja, the state capital. Busari gave the assurance during a Peace Walk and presentation of the Media Position to the police command and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Lokoja. He said the police would continue to provide adequate security all through the campaigns up till the election proper, when the personnel would be further beefed up with more reinforcement. “The inspector-general of police has assisted us by posting manpower to us before this election to ensure that we manage the campaign period and he will send more personnel for the election,” he said. During the election, the commissioner said that all the polling units would be well-manned with no fewer than eight personnel each to provide adequate security and enable the electorate to cast their votes without molestations. Also, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. James Apam, said the commission was committed to conduct the election in a free, fair and credible manner. “This time round, we want to hold a brief and clean election in this state, at least, for once; our meetings with young people and women are going to help,” he said. Earlier, Chairman, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Kogi, Alhaji Adeiza Momoh-Jimoh, charged INEC to conduct free, fair and credible elections for the sustenance of democracy.
