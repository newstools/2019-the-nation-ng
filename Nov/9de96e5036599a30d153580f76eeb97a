 Head Coach, Nigeria’s Super Sand Eagles Audu Adamu Ejo has attributed his team’s early exit from the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup to late preparations and lack of motivation. Adamu made this known in a chat after his team lost its second group game to Oman 5 – 6 to remain rooted at the bottom of the table with no point, having lost its opening match 10-1 to Portugal. He said if Nigeria is to make an appreciable impact in future Beach Soccer World Cup, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) must encourage the introduction of beach soccer league in the country. The Kogi born tactician said countries like Paraguay, Brazil, Oman and others have beach soccer leagues where they select players for both continental and international competitions unlike Nigeria where such doesn’t exist. He praised his boys for their performance so far considering the hurried nature they preparation for the tournament. “My boys are good and experienced in beach soccer. What we need is motivation in terms of allowances and regular training.  NFF needs to introduce beach soccer league. Countries doing well have beach soccer leagues. “Secondly, we only assemble when there is competition and no friendly matches for us like other national teams.  It looks like we don’t exist as a national team. Before this FIFA World Cup, apart from our qualifiers, the team only participated in COPA Lagos and Paraguay’s six-nation Beach Soccer International friendly which ended three days to the World Cup. But Brazil and Senegal take part in every international beach soccer competition.
