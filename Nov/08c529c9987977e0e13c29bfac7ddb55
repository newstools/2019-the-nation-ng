 A CLEEN Foundation on Wednesday said it has concluded arrangement to deploy 61 observers to monitor Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State. Assistant Programme Manager, CLEEN Foundation, Chigozirim Okoro, said this in Lokoja, the state capital, during a training workshop it organised for the observers ahead of the governorship election. The workshop, which was organised in conjunction with the European Union (EU) in support of democratic governance in Nigeria, had the theme:  “Mitigating Electoral Violence in Nigeria for the 2019 off-Season Kogi Governorship Election.” Okoro described the Kogi election as one that had engaged the attention of the world, adding that this was why the election observers must see their role as sacrosanct. She urged them to be observant and to report important details regarding the election. She called on them to monitor the election process beginning from the deployment of voting materials through to the collation of results. She called for professionalism in the conduct of their activities.
