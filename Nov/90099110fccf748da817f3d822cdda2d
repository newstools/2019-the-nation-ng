THE police in Lagos on Wednesday arraigned one 40-year-old Oluwatobi Ajibade, who allegedly beat up his wife. Ajibade, who resides on Fakeye Street, Alagbole in Akute area of Lagos State, is facing a two-count charge bordering on maltreatment. He, however, pleaded not guilty before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. The prosecutor, ASP Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the defendant committed the offences at No. 4, William Compound Oke-Aro, Ogba in Aguda area of Lagos. Emuerhi said the defendant beat up his wife and failed to provide for their two children,  aged three years and seven months. He said that wife beating contravened Section 245 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015. The News Agency Nigeria (NAN) reports that the  section stipulates two years’ jail term for the offence. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olufunke Sule-Amzat, granted the defendant  bail in the sum of N20,000 with one surety in like sum. Sule-Amzat urged the defendant to ensure  adequate care to his wife and children. The case continues on December 2. In Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, 21-year-old Musa Bala was sentenced to one year imprisonment for stealing four cellphones. Chief Magistrate Abdulhamid Lawal convicted Bala after he pleaded guilty to a one-count charge of stealing. The convict was, however, given an option of N25,000 fine.
