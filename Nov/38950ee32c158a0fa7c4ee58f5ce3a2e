From Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta  Former Ogun State Governor Olusegun Osoba has sued an Afenifere chieftain, Senator Femi Okunrounmu, for alleged libellous publications against him. Aremo Osoba, who dragged Okunrounmu, an Alliance for Democracy (AD) senator (1999-2003) through his counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, before a state High Court in Abeokuta last Friday, is demanding N3billion damages. Osoba, an All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, is also asking Okunrounmu to retract the alleged libellous materials in two national newspapers. In the originating writ of summons, Osoba prayed the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining Okunrounmu from further publishing libellous materials against him. The defendant had in a published newspaper interview allegedly described Osoba as a “traitor and double-faced politician” who betrayed the late politician and presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief MKO Abiola.
