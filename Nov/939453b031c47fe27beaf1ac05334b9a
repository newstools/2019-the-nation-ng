Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, Kwara state capital has sacked the All Progressives Congress (APC) member representing Ilorin South Constituency Hassan Azeez Oluwanilo from the House of Assembly. The court declared the Peoples Democratic Party’s House candidate for Ilorin South State Constituency in the March 9th House of Assembly election as duly elected. Delivering his judgment Justice Hamman Barkar Hkawu based the court’s decision on the disputed APC primaries, which produced Alhaji Suleiman Abdulsalam popularly known as Sule cement but was later replaced with 28- year- old Oluwanilo. The court held that APC had no valid candidate for the 2019 House of Assembly elections and thereby declared the PDP candidate with the second highest votes Jimoh Raheem Agboola as the winner of the poll. The PDP candidate had challenged the eligibility of APC candidate and his party nomination process at the tribunal. The Election Petition Tribunal had earlier ordered for fresh election in the constituency in dispute. The court also ordered Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a fresh certificate of return to the PDP candidate. Reacting, ex- Kwara Speaker Dr Ali Ahmad, who represented Ilorin South in the 8th Assembly, hailed the court’s judgment, stressing that Agboola would be one of the ranking members in the House. Ahmad said: “This is to congratulate my brother on his deserved victory at the Court of Appeal to represent my constituency in KWHA. “It’s all about Kwara, and as the second most ranking member in the House, I hope they both provide clear path to good governance.”
