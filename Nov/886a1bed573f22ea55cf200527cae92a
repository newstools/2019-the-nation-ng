  Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Owan West Local Government Area have endorsed second term tickets of Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Hon Philip Shaibu. The Owan West APC stated this at a rally attended by party members from the 11 wards of the council area. Chairman of the council, Hon. Frank Ilaboya, in his speech, said Governor Obaseki had improved health care, education and built good roads across the state. Ilaboya stated that their support for Governor Obaseki was because salaries and pensions are paid promptly. He said Obaseki and Shaibu deserved another four years in office, adding that the 4+4 project was not negotiable. “We are gathered here this afternoon because of Governor Godwin Obaseki and Philip Shaibu 2020 project. Owan West wants to tell the whole world that they are solidly behind the project and to endorse them for second term. There is no vacancy in Osadebey Avenue,” Ilaboya said. Other speakers at the event urged party members to support the Obaseki/Shaibu project. Highlight of the event was the donation of motorbikes by the council boss to the chairmen of wards 2 and 10, Hon. Lucky Aroye and Mr. Gentle Omage, respectively. Noting that the donation was part of measures to reward loyalty for the Obaseki/Shaibu project, Ilaboya urged the people to continue to support the party in the 4+4 movement in the local government area. Dignitaries at the event included wife of the Council Chairman and Chairperson of Women Development Programme, Mrs. Patience Ilaboya; Special Adviser to the Governor on Political Affairs (Edo North), among others.
