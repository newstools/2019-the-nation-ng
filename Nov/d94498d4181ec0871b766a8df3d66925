From November 18 to 21, Abuja will host the 2019 National Agribusiness Conference of The Institute of Agribusiness Management Nigeria (IAMN).  The theme of the conference is “Think Forward: Driving Nigeria’s Pathway to Prosperity through Sustainable Agribusiness”. The conference is an annual gathering of professionals working in various segments of the agricultural value chains in Nigeria, including crop and livestock production, agro processing, food manufacturing, commodity exports, agro logistics, agribusiness education, development among others. This year’s edition will be hosted at Chelsea Hotel, Abuja. At a press conference organised by the Local Organising Committee to intimate the agribusiness community about the all-important conference, the Committee Chairman, Richard Ogundele reiterated the need for creation of more global market access for food commodities of Nigerian origin as well as create a pathway out of the various logjams that have inhibited the growth of agribusiness entrepreneurs toward sustainable profitability.  He said Nigeria’s population has been projected to hit 400 million by 2050; and from available statistics, over 65 per cent of them will be youths in need of employment, food shelter and basic needs of life. To this end, he said steps must be taken to ensure farmers have access to innovation for sustainable food production. The IAMN hopes that during the conference, practical solutions to address challenges highlighted, will be discussed and addressed with a view to sharing good business models with the public and organized private sector actors as a mean of facilitating economic growth and development using agribusiness as a major platform.
