 NIGERIAN Army troops deployed at Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno have subdued Boko Haram terrorists and rescued an octogenarian, three women and four children they held captive. Army Operations Media Coordinator Col. Aminu Iliyasu disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. Iliyasu said the rescued victims were evacuated while the children were vaccinated against polio by a Nigerian Army medical team. He added that no causality was recorded by the army troops during the commando operations. According to him, many of the Boko Haram elements fled towards the summit of Mandara Mountains with gunshot wounds. “The troops’ resilience and doggedness are unwavering as further exploitation to complete the annihilation of the insurgents is being sustained in the mountainous environment. “The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai wishes to reassure the public of the resolve of the Nigerian Army to continue to execute our constitutional mandate professionally and responsively for a better secured Nigeria. “He also thanks all well-meaning Nigerians for their continued support, goodwill and understanding towards officers and men of the Nigerian Army as they sustain the conduct of various operations and routine exercises nationwide,” he said. Iliyasu said that the army troops continued to sustain the tempo of the counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast with a view to decimating and destroying the remnant of Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa (ISWAP) criminals. He said the troops had also continued to extract credible intelligence on the presence of some of the insurgents in the areas.
