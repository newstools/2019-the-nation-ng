 THE  Chief Executive Officer of Wakanow.com Limited, Mr. Adebayo Adedeji has promised to focus on customer satisfaction, innovation, expansion and automation. He gave the promise during his inaugural media interactive session which took place at the corporate head office of the company in Lagos. He said:  “Our number one goal is to ensure that our customers not only get the best, value-adding travel products and services but also that their experience is the best it can be, from the moment of first contact, online or offline. This includes a smooth booking process, reliable turnaround times, and a quality that exceeds your expectations. We realise we may not meet that goal 100 per cent of the time, but we won’t stop improving until we do.”
