Raymond Mordi, Yenagoa The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is set to commence the collation of results of the Bayelsa State governorship election conducted on Saturday. The exercise, which was scheduled to start at 10.00 am on Sunday at the Prof. Mahmood Yakubu Media Centre, had been delayed indefinitely. The commission’s Head, Voter Education and Publicity, Wilfred Ifogah, had indicated on Saturday night that the exercise would begin at 10.00 am on Sunday. However, almost five hours after, the collation is yet to commence. Accredited journalists, election observers and party agents had been waiting for officials of INEC to begin the exercise. There is heavy security presence within and outside the commission’s office located along the Swali Market Road in Yenagoa. Only five journalists have been admitted into the hall; the others have asked to monitor the proceedings from a canopy outside the auditorium.
