Acting as a trusted service provider between visa applicants and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, VFS TasHeel’s visa services centres, which are present in Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe, provides full array of visa services including, dissemination of accurate visa information, application guidance, fee management, identity management with biometrics enrollment and application submission for all available visa categories. The biometric enrollment includes highly secure collection of fingerprints, facial image and biographic details, such as passport information. It will be recalled that VFS TasHeel started serving customers on 27 September, 2019, under the new tourist Visa in most of its countries of operations. A spokesperson of VFS TasHeel said, “The increasing openness of international markets brings immense opportunities to the tourism sector – and Saudi Arabia’s new policies acknowledge that tourism has an important role to play the kingdom’s social and economic development. In support of the government’s initiatives, we are pleased to offer tourist visa services in 30 countries, and make the entire process more seamless and convenient for potential leisure travellers and pilgrims for Umrah.”
