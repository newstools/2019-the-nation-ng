Nduka Chiejina (Assistant Editor) Treasurers and Financial Controllers of Non-Interest Banks in Nigeria have met to work out solutions to liquidity management challenges that affect Non-Interest banks in the country. They met in Abuja last week and also agreed to redefine the present narrative on Non-Interest Financial Institutions, while forging a common framework that will boost the growth and rapid development of the industry. Speaking at the inaugural session of Non Interest Finance Association of Nigeria, NIFAN in Abuja, Managing Director TAJBank, Norfadelizan Abdul Rahman, said Nigeria’s Non-Interest Industry has “enormous potential but would require the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders to drive and maximise growth to ensure that it takes a stronger position within its niche.” While giving examples of different jurisdictions where Non-Interest banking has become the norm, the Managing Director urged participants to “return to their respective banks with a renewed focus on collaboration such that their various efforts under NIFAN would be of benefit to the industry and its customers.” Mr Norfadelizan Abdul Rahman encouraged the body to create a clear agenda that will strengthen and enrich the burgeoning Non-Interest Financial Institutions (NIFI) industry.
