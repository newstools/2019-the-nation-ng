A statement by Omoluwabi Leadership Reporters, organisers of the event, showed that the prospective inductees were selected on the basis of their sterling credentials, public and private comportments which typified the ethos of ỌMỌLÚWÀBÍ (well behaved Yoruba person) and more recently their public spirited standpoint en-route to safeguarding the interest of Nigerian masses, were all put into consideration. According to the Award Governing Board under the chairmanship of Professor David Adeyemo, “the OMOLUWABI HALL OF FAME is one distinguished award reserved for prominent sons and daughters of the Yoruba race who have through their life accomplishments, portrayed and extolled the virtues and values of true sons and daughters of the race. The prestigious HALL was founded as a platform to project the well deserving recipients to further encourage and sensitize the young coming generations on preserving our rare values as a race through selfless service and conduct that are contributory to the preservation of the Yoruba ancestry as well as development of the nation. Speaking on the selection methodology, the project coordinator, Omoba Adekunle Ayegbe said “it is imperative to establish that the selection Panel for this prestigious Hall of Fame comprises of well-meaning professionals drawn from all walks of life who objectively considered without bias or favoritism, the public recommendations of Nominees, through a fair and transparent process. A fundamental hallmark of this coveted award is the presentation of a book entitled “EPITOME OF OMOLUWABI, a collection of short biographies of exceptionally gifted Yoruba sons and daughters whose lives are explicitly offered a heroic exemplar for the younger generation”
The induction lecture with the theme OMOLUWABI ETHOS: A CODE FOR CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION is strategically designed to add an intellectual spice and push the frontiers of conceptual solution on contemporary national issues.
