 THE Enogie (Duke) of Ogan community in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State HRH George Igbinovia has fled his palace and community to avoid being lynched by angry youths. Many residents who also abandoned the community since last Saturday were yet to return at press time. The Enogie’s palace, six other houses and vehicles were set ablaze by the irate youths. It was gathered that the youths chased away their monarch after soldiers invited to the community by the Enogie and his sons allegedly shot one Agharuwa Pulley dead. Eyewitnesses said the youths mobilised to the Enogie’s palace to demand for money realised from the borrow pit in the community when one of his sons drove in with armed soldiers. The soldiers reportedly opened fire hitting Agharuwa who died on the spot. Another witness said the crisis was connected to a tussle for the control of the borrow pit between the Enogie’s eldest son and his stepbrothers. The community charges some fee for sand excavated from the pit. Speaking to newsmen, HRH Igbinovia said his eldest son instigated the community against him over money realised from the borrow pit. “They have driven me away,” he said, “it is only this clothing on my body that I have left. My son said I am old.” But the eldest son Prince Daniel Igbinovia denied the allegation, saying the boy was killed by soldiers brought by his stepbrothers. “I never instigated anybody. I was in Brigade Command when the incident took place. I don’t believe in violence. I believe in peaceful resolution.” A resident in the community who pleaded anonymity said the burrow pit belonged to all of them and not any of the sons of Enogie. The residents said they did not receive any money paid into the community’s account.
