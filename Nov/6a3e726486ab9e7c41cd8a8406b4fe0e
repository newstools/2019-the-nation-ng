 THE Assistant  Inspector  General  of Police (AIG)  in charge of  Zone 2, Ahmed  Iliyasu, has appealed to residents in his zone to try and know  their neighbours  for easy detection of crime and promised  to fight crime  in Lagos and Ogun states. He made this appeal on Thursday at the Banquet Hall, Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Ikeja, during the Crime Reporters’ Association of Nigeria (CRAN) lecture. AIG Iliyasu said: “It is of great concern the way arms and ammunition are being illegally imported, made and possessed despite effects on the security and economy of the country”. He enjoined the general public to give police information on any form of crime or danger in their neighborhood and to be always security conscious and vigilant. He said the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Abubakar Adams inaugurated  and launched the Operation Puff Adder on April 5, 2019 as a veritable, vehicular, anti-crime machine  to dismantle  all forms of crime and criminality.
