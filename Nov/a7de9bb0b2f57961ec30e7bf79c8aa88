By Robert Egbe The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has pledged to increase Nigerians’ access to its services to check the scourge of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV). NHRC Executive Secretary Tony Ojukwu spoke in Lagos, at the just-concluded public sitting of the special investigation panel on SGBV. The panel was constituted following complaints received on April 26, 2019, alleging that armed security personnel led by the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), under the auspices of the FCT Joint Task Force, illegally raided night clubs and the streets of Abuja.  Victims of the raid made several allegations of rape and sexual harassment, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment against the raiders. The NHRC boss said the SIP sittings which will hold in the six geo- political zones will enable all victims of all SGBV in the country to be heard. “We therefore urge other victims of Sexual and Gender Based Violence to forward their complaints to the panel”, Ojukwu said. According to him, the public sitting will check the SGBV scourge in Nigeria and increase access to  the Commissionthe services.
