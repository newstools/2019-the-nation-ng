Our Reporter  Lagos-based political/human rights activist, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, has advised the 9th Senate to kill the hate speech bill pending before it. Onitiri, in a statement released in Lagos yesterday, said the bill is anti-people and out to gag Nigerians and deprive them of their freedom as entrenched in the constitution. Chief Onitiri, who is the secretary general of Lagos Elders Council, said: “Nigerians have gone far to earn this freedom. “On behalf of all patriotic Nigerian democrats, “we wish to call on the Senate to kill the hate speech bill before it at the second reading. The bill is anti-people and out to gag Nigerians.  It is also directed to stifle the opposition and deny the people their rights to freedom of speech. “If the bill is not killed, Nigerians will regard the Senate as a mere rubber stamp of the Executive and an enemy of the oppressed Nigerians in the majority. Our constitution has adequately provided for redress for anyone who feels assaulted by any false publication.”
