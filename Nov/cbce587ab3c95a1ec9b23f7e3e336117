Data Science Nigeria (DSN) is leading a revolution to upskill and retool young Nigerians in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable them become more productive to the country and the world at large. DSN, a non-governmental organisation pursuing democratising knowledge in AI and related fields for socio-economic development held AI Summit in Lagos where it reiterated the vision to raise one million high-qualified, world-class AI talents in the next 10 years. The group believes that building a local data science/big data/AI ecosystem will position Nigeria to become the outsourcing hub for international Data Science/Advanced Analytics/Big Data projects with opportunity to access 10per cent share of the global data science outsourcing projects, worth $3.3 billion in revenue by 2020. In a keynote titled: ‘Artificial Intelligence for Development’, Prof (Emeritus) and Director of Intelligent Systems Research at Oregon State University, Prof. Thomas Dietterich, described AI as catalyst for economic advancement. He said AI presents opportunities for economic transformation in unique.  According to him, although the developing economies still lag behind in some areas with regards AI adoption and applications, however, organisations like Data Science Nigeria, have shown clear roadmap capable of putting the country on the right footings and build the national competitiveness given the right skills set. He said developing AI enabled weather management solutions, for instance, will assist the continent address some challenges faced by farmers thereby leading to improved food production/sufficiency. Prof Dietterich said with the growing community of AI enthusiasts and learners, Nigeria and indeed Africa will witness a major boost in skills needed for research and development focused on bringing applied AI solutions to existing community problems. He however, emphasised that to make progress in this direction requires making sense out of the big data and applying the results to track diseases, and make the nation safer, better, and well-structured for collective well-being
