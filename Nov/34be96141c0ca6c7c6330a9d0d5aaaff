Bose Odusanya will aim for her fifth consecutive title at the 51st Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup which serves off on Monday at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Also men’s singles defending champion, David Fayele who defied all odds last year to beat number one seed, Olajide Omotayo to drive home a brand new saloon car will also be aiming to shield other players from cuddling the trophy this year. Already, Odusanya and Fayele have expressed their intention to retain their title but the players are aware of the task ahead when they admitted during the press conference to herald the tournament that they are ready to face the challenges. “I know it will not be easy this year considering the quality of players in Lagos but I am not also ready to surrender the title this year and that is why I have been training in the last two months in order to be in top shape. There is no doubt that the tournament gets tougher every year but nothing can stop me from retaining the title again having been holding on to it since 2015,” a confident Odusanya said. Like Odusanya, Fayele is optimism that he will not be dethroned. “I know I will retain the title because I have worked hard in training and I don’t see anybody stopping me. My aim is to set a record in the tournament by winning as many times as possible and being a champion is not always easy but I am ready to emerge champion again this year,” Fayele boasted. Players are expected to finalise their registration for the five-day tournament with matches expected to commence as well in the cadet, junior and senior categories.
