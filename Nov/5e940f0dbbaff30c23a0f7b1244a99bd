You are canvassing suppor for INEC in the forthcoming elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. Can you elaborate on this? I solicited support for the electoral process, because it is not only one stakeholder (INEC) that will ensure the success of the process. It is all of us, including the voters; the list is well known…is it the political parties, the National Assembly, the media and all the stakeholders. All are responsible for the success or not of an election. Fear of likely violence in the November 16 election in Kogi has been rife. INEC too said this much some days back. Are these fears justifiable? I think violence is one of those elements which is very difficult to predict. I have been working for peace keeping operations for decades and I can tell you that in all the places, you could feel something could happen, but would never know when it would happen, and if it would eventually materialize. So, you can’t predict violence. This is my lesson in several years of peace keeping operations and of work in areas which are prone to violence. So, unfortunately, you may have indications, but, when, how and if it will manifest, you can never predict. How do you assess INEC and the security agencies and their preparedness towards the November 16 governership election? Well, I have not been following every single step of INEC, but what I have seen so far, I have seen a large interest; a great commitment and willingness to draw from lessons which were gathered by the just concluded 2019 general election, and a force is coming together to make it a success. We as ECES, we have been to some of the activities in terms of support, both financial, and we have exchanged ideas. Have you seen any improvements in the electoral process? I witnessed only one election, so I can’t compare with any other, but only by those writings and reports made by others. Comparing for me at this stage is not possible element. There is the issue of vote buying. Do you consider this a threat to democracy,  and how can it be discouraged? I don’t want to sound to you optimistic, but I can tell you that unfortunately, vote buying is a practice which is not only common in Nigeria or Africa. Some people come to me and say, ‘you know this politician came to me and said…. It is more sophisticated there, because they may promise infrastructure, work or some occupational engagement. It is a terrible aspect of institution building, but one also has to wonder why. In Scandinavian countries, it is less likely, because they have a system which is based on the welfare of the citizens. You get there by the elimination of poverty or reducing poverty. And, how do you do that? By creating the institution’s that serve the people to live decent lives and education. I will never stop saying this; also by balancing salaries. I can tell you that in Italy, there has been huge struggle from the people against the parliamentarians, because they felt they had too many privileges. I don’t know the salaries here in Nigeria, but I can tell you about Italy. What are the challenges of electoral democracy in Nigeria? I think the challenge is to improve from a judicial/legal perspective and reform perspective. Nigeria is a member of so many different International organisations, and they are very relevant countries, on civil/political rights, both at international and regional levels. It has the instrument to make the system to work always better. For example, you cannot have a system whereby judgement are  are delivered; when we speak about pre-election  cases, judgement are delivered the day to the election. This is not conducive to proper administration of the system. But, this is just an example, and such that the legal department of the INEC is working on. I just wish really peaceful election in the November 16, for Kogi and Bayelsa, and for all those to come. It is my hope that all they are doing will help contribute to free, fair and credible election in Nigeria.
