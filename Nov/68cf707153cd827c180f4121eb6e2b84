Lagos State Government on Thursday gave marching orders to all street traders, squatters and occupiers of shanties and commercial vehicles presently on the stretch of Outer Marina up to the frontage of the State House Marina, from the foot of Apongbon Bridge, to immediately vacate the area or get arrested and prosecuted. Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, in a statement said from next week, the Parks and Garden Agency would commence work on the beautification and landscaping of the whole stretch of the outer Marina. He added that operatives of the State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences will enforce the state laws on all offenders including commercial vehicles that stop and pick passengers indiscriminately. Bello also warned pedestrians in the habit of dashing across the road and not climbing the provided overhead bridge that officials of the State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) will be deployed to the location to arrest anyone who endangers his life. He emphasised that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was committed to restoring the state’s greenery. In his words: “The State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences will soon be moving to Ikoyi and Victoria Island to clean up the area in terms of environmental nuisances.” He restated his warning to street traders that no area would be left out of enforcement, adding that Oyingbo has just been cleared of street traders and man-made traffic bottlenecks.
