Super Eagles star, Samuel Chukwueze scored Villarrealâ€™s only goal in the 3-1 defeat to Celtic Vigo at the Estadio de la Ceramica. The 20-year-old, who made his senior debut for the yellow submarines last season, making 26 league appearances with five goals and two assists has continued his fine form for club and country this term. Chukwueze started alongside former Arsenal star Santi Cazorla in midfield but it was the visitors that took the lead through Pione Sisto in the 54th minute. It took the Nigerian just four minutes to level scores for his third goal of the season as he brilliantly finished a pass from Xavier Quintilla. The game slipped away from the home side when Iago Aspas collected a pass from Lucas Olaza and calmly finished past Sergio Asenjo in goal for Villarreal. Aspas ensured all three points for his side with a late goal to end the match 3-1. Despite the win, Celta Vigo remains in the relegation zone with 12 points while Villarreal sit 12th with 18 points after 14 La Liga matches.
