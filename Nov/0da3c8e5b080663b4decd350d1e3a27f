 VISA said it has unveiled a suite of innovative security capabilities to help prevent and disrupt payment fraud, breaking new ground in cybersecurity and fraud prevention across Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA). The innovative solutions were unveiled at the Visa CEMEA Security Summit 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. The forum brings together payment industry experts from risk, business and operational departments of financial institutions, merchants, processors and other payment service providers. The new payment security services and capabilities help protect the integrity of the payments ecosystem by detecting and disrupting fraud threats targeting financial institutions and merchants. The new capabilities are available to Visa clients at no additional cost or sign-up, but through Visa’s continued investments in intelligence and technology. These add to the long list of benefits financial institution and merchant clients enjoy as participants in the Visa global payment network. Its Regional Risk Officer, CEMEA, Hector Rodriguez said: “Cybercriminals attempt to bypass traditional defensesby stealing credentials, harvesting data, obtaining privileged access, and attacking trusted third-party supply chains.  Visa’snew payment security capabilities combine payment and cyber intelligence, insights and learnings from breach investigations.” remove fraud controls to withdraw money from cash machines fraudulently, and automated testing of values and credentials to gain unauthorised access to information and functionality called “enumeration attacks” were among the most prevalent account-related fraud types identified by respondents. At the same time, card-not-present fraud that includes ecommerce, phone and mail orders was found to be less frequent but caused more damage to businesses-representing nearly 40per cent of fraud losses and operational costs. Managing payment fraud holistically is imperative to meet these challenges.
