Frank Ikpefan, Abuja  The National Youth Service Corps has handed over a 200-level student identified as Rose to the Department of State Services for investigation. Rose, a 200-level journalism student at a university in Benin Republic was arrested by officials of the scheme in Zamfara state camp while undergoing the Batch C Stream 1 orientation course which ended on Monday, November 26, 2019. She was alleged to have obtained a fake certificate from another university in Benin Republic to participate in the orientation exercise at the Zamfara camp. NYSC Director-General, Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, confirmed the arrest of the student to our reporter in Abuja. According to the DG, friends of the 200-level student saw her in an NYSC uniform on the social media when she was supposed to be studying journalism at a university in Benin Republic. Ibrahim said her institution wrote to the scheme when they discovered her on the social media, posting her photographs in the NYSC uniform in the Zamfara camp. The DG noted that the 200-Level student had been brought to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and handed over to officials of the DSS for further investigation. The NYSC DG said: “On Friday, one of the universities in Cotonou, Benin Republic saw their 200-Level student in the NYSC uniform on the social media. She is supposed to be a 200-Level of the university studying journalism. “But she went and purchased a fake certificate from another Benin Republic university and now served in the camp in Zamfara. So, her classmates saw her on social media and raised the alarm to the university, which then alerted and wrote me. “The university said they recognised the efforts of the scheme in nabbing fake graduates and they were not a party to her fake certificate. “So we got her arrested in Zamfara. She was brought to Abuja and we have arranged with the DSS to take her away.”
