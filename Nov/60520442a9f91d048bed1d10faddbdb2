 UNDER fire Coach Imama Amapakabo says the Olympic Eagles are ready for a thrilling encounter against Zambia in their second Group B match at the on-going Total U-23 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. The Dream Team began their quest for a ticket to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games on a shaky note by Amapakabo has highlighted the importance of today’s encounter after the team’s 1-0 loss to  Cote d’Ivoire in their opening match on Friday. “The team came into this competition with sketchy pictures of every other team and we believe that these games are going to see the full complements of all the teams in the strength of everything,” he said. “Next game we play Zambia, we know it’s definitely going to be an exciting game because we know how it is important for both teams to actually get result, that both team desire to go forward. “The first round of games were done and dusted, the second games are going to be more exciting. I think that going forward, every team will want to come out and attack unlike what we saw in most of the first game when teams were a bit cautious because they didn’t know a lot about the opposition,” he said. Meanwhile, Amapakabo has defended the whistle-stop visit of Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr to the Olympic Eagles training camp in Ismailia shortly before the AFCON got underway last weekend, adding the buck of the team stops at his desk. “It is very right of him (Rohr) to be here to see the players that will go into the next level, which is the A team proper. So first hand, he has been able to see some of them,” he noted. “The visit only gives Rohr the opportunity to see most of the players we have here first hand. Every decision here is principally mine and mine alone.
