A Pennsylvania man slashed another man in the face during a bloody brawl that ensued after he walked in on him having sex with his wife, a report said. Joseph Batenga, 38, got into the fight with William Wolf, 43, when he found Wolf having sex with his wife in a Brush Creek Township home in Central Pennsylvania on Saturday night, Penn Live reported. Wolf punched Batenga in the face a number of times during the fight, breaking his nose and several of his teeth, according to the report. Batenga then grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed Wolf across the face with it, the newspaper reported. Batenga’s wife Bonnie Batenga — who was having sex with Wolf before the fight — then jumped in and began to hit and push Wolf. Bonnie was cited for harassment, while Wolf and Batenga were both arrested and charged in the fight, the report said. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
