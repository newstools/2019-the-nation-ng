 A firm, Advanced Concrete Technologies (ACT), has launched a new range of construction solutions. They include the Aquafin Betocrete Plus, fourth-generation crystalline admixtures by the Schomburg Group, Germany, and a new range of Costar Building Product System. Colton Group Managing Partner Anthony Ajulo said the solutions will help combat building collapse. He said the solutions can also be used in road construction. He said: “We have building collapses because of compromises in the quality of materials. We have gone to bring some of the best quality products in the world. “Some of these products, such as Aquafin, are German products, while some others are American products. So, they are best you can find around here. “Building collapses are caused when, for instance, you are mixing your concrete, and you want it at certain strength, but you are not using the right dosage of cement or you are using the right dosage but you are not getting the right quantity of sand and all that. “Our admixtures will help you address all these shortcomings. And that’s why we are launching these products. It will help to address the problems of building collapse. It will also help homeowners and consultants to construct watertight homes.” Colton Group Managing Partner Collins Balogun said the products can help tackle poor-quality road constructions. “One of the products unveiled is the fourth-generation waterproofing systems. You see, the number one problem concrete roads have is water. This is because you are bound to have rainwater moving all around the concrete roads. “But if this product is integrated into the concrete, this makes the concrete impervious to water percolation. By so doing, it increases the lifespan of the concrete. For instance, if a road is designed to last for 70 years, with the help of our admixtures, it is going to last 150 years,” he said.
