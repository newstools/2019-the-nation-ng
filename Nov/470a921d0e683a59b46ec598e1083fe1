 CHELSEA recorded a sixth consecutive Premier League win for the first time since their title-winning season of 2016-17 as they moved up to second in the table. The Blues’ victory over Crystal Palace means they are now five points behind leaders Liverpool. Frank Lampard’s side moved above Manchester City, who play leaders Liverpool on Today. Tammy Abraham’s 10th league goal of the season and Christian Pulisic’s header ensured the win against a resolute Palace side who barely got out of their own half during the first period. And after dominating a goalless opening half, Chelsea finally made the breakthrough when Mateo Kovacic and Willian combined to release Abraham – with the forward stroking a right-foot effort into the bottom right corner from 10 yards. James Tomkins missed a glorious opportunity to equalise for the Eagles, heading Luka Milivojevic’s right-wing delivery wide from six yards. But Chelsea more than merited their win, with Pulisic wrapping up the points with a close-range header after Michy Batshuayi’s deflected shot fell into his path. Palace’s defeat, their third in four games, leaves them ninth in the table. While Chelsea may no longer have Eden Hazard, there still appears to have been a notable evolution in their attacking play since Lampard was installed as manager. His team may enjoy less possession and play fewer passes (per game) than under former boss Maurizio Sarri but they look considerably more dynamic. Fikayo Tomori, 21, Mason Mount, 20 and Abraham, 22, have all come into the team, while Christian Pulisic, 21, and 19-year-old Reece James, making his first Premier League start, ensured Lampard’s starting side was the club’s youngest ever in Premier League terms.
