Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State, Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa has described the victory of APC in last Saturday’s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states as heartwarming. He added that the party’s victory is a resonating testament that the will of the people remains the ultimate in a democracy. Hon Bolarinwa said “having led a party to victory, l understand that it is no mean feat to win elections in Nigeria today. “I, therefore, congratulate Yahaya Bello of Kogi state and David Lyon of Bayelsa state for their resounding victories in last Saturday’s governorship elections.” He called on the Kogi governor-elect to see his victory as a clarion call to redouble his efforts and prioritise the welfare of the people in his second term while urging the Bayelsa governor-elect to be conscious of his jinx breaking victory. He said Mr. Lyon’s victory was a pointer to the fact that no matter how entrenched any political party or officeholder is, the people ultimately determine who governs them. APC chair hailed the resoluteness of the party members who went through thick and thin to reassert the will of the people.
