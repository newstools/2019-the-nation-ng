THE governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon, has promised to develop waterways security to boost the tourism potentials of coastal communities in Brass Local Government Area. Lyon also promised to design sustainable women and youth development and empowerment programmes aimed at reducing the rising wave of poverty, unemployment and crime in the state, if he is elected as governor in the November 16 election. The APC candidate made these promises during his governorship campaign rally in Okpoama, the country home of former governor and minister of state for petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, on Wednesday. Lyon said the people of the area had no reason to experience poverty and underdevelopment if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government made the right investment with crude oil and gas proceeds that accrued to the state in the past eight years. meaning Bayelsans to change the face of the oil and gas-rich Brass Island Speaking earlier at the palace of Amayanabo of Okpoama, King Ebitimi Banigo, the Okpo XXI, where he received royal blessings and endorsement, the APC candidate said though he hails from Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, he â€˜s a son of Brass LGC because he is married to their daughter. In that sense, he also feels the pains of the people for the past eight years. In his response, King Banigo, who described him as a worthy son of Bayelsa State, who has touched the lives of many, said that many politicians had come with fantastic promises without fulfilling any of them. He, however, urged Lyon to fulfill his promises when elected into office.
