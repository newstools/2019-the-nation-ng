Abdulrasheed Maina, former Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTM), on Monday, arrived at the Federal High Court, Abuja, with the aid of a walking stick. Maina, who came into Court 6, 2nd Floor of the building, at about 9:40am, supported himself with a walking stick. The ex-pension reform boss, who is standing trial on alleged money laundering charge to the tune of over N2 billion preferred against him by the EFCC, was dressed in a brown caftan with a matching cap. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Justice Abang had, on Nov. 21, fixed Monday for hearing on the bail application and for continuation of his trial. The judge, who accused the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS) of compounding the issue before the court for failure to produce a medical report on the health status of Maina days after the order to the effect was made by the court, ruled that Maina’s trial would be on a day-to-day basis in subsequent proceedings. NAN reports that the trial of Maina was stalled in the last adjourned date due to his worsening health condition. The EFCC had on Oct. 25, arraigned Maina alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, before Justice Abang. Though he pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge, his trial has yet to make meaningful progress due to his failing health. The court is yet to hear Maina’s bail application fixed for today.
