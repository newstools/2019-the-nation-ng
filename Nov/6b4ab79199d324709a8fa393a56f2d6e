 The House of Representatives may penalise some of its members who are claiming to be leaders of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House. The Green Chamber accused them of creating confusion and misleading the public. The House, at its sitting yesterday, asked its Committee on Ethics and Privileges to investigate allegation that Kingsley Chinda, Chukwuma Onyema, Umar Barre and Muriana Ajibola had been parading themselves as leaders of the PDP caucus in the House. Hon. China and others were proposed as Minority leaders of the House by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but lost ground to Hon. Ndudi Elumelu and his team who are currently the leaders of the Minority in the House. The PDP has said that Chinda remain its choice of Minority Leader while insisting that Hon. Elumelu should step down from the position or face sanction. However, rising under matters of urgent national importance, Hon. Ben Igbakpa (PDP, Delta) said the Chinda led group has been issuing public statements outside the nomenclature of this House; misleading the general public and causing confusion and disaffection in the House of Representatives. According to him, their action is a gross abuse of the collective and individual privileges of members of house and violates Section 24, Legislative Houses (Powers and Privileges) Act, Cap L.12, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 as well extant provisions of the Standing Orders of this House. He said: â€œSection 60, Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1-999 (As Amended) provides that the House of Representatives shalt powers to regulate its own procedure. This is supported by Order 1 (1) 8. (2) of the Standing Orders of this House.
