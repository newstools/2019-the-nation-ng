Over 62,000 vulnerable children and their caregivers across eight local government areas in Lagos State have benefited from a five-year project by Local Partners For Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Nigeria (LOPIN Region 1). It was a project implemented by Association for Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH) and funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Speaking yesterday in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos at the end of the project dissemination ceremony with the theme; “Finishing innovatively with impact”, Commissioner, Ministry of Youths and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, said the project was targeted at strengthening the economic capacity of identified vulnerable families, who are struggling to make ends meet, infected/affected by HIV/AIDS and on other contemporary public health issues including care and support for vulnerable children and their households. Represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mrs Yewande Falugba, Dawodu, said that it is a five-year project in partnership with the state local governments, community-based organisations, care givers and other key stakeholders in the state. He said the impact of the project was felt positively in areas of financial and psychosocial support, noting that orphans and vulnerable children had access to quality health and nutrition, shelter and education in the seven local government areas of the state where the project was executed.
