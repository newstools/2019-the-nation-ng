Barring last minute changes, the National Executive Council (NEC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will be convened on Friday, November 22, 2019. The last NEC of the party was convened in August, 2018, contrary to the party’s law, which stipulates quarterly meeting of the body. Sources at the party’s national secretariat told The Nation in Abuja on Monday that a circular had been issued to the effect. It was learnt that the party’s National Caucus will meet on Thursday, while the NEC is scheduled for Friday. The failure of the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led executive council to convene the NEC for more than a year has been a major concern among party stakeholders. It led some elements within the party, including the non-National Working Committee (nNWC), the Forum of State Chairmen and the Director-General of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh Lukman, calling for its convocation. A source in the party’s executive council, who wished not to be named, said the Friday date for the meeting may not be sacrosanct yet. The source said President Muhammadu Buhari may not be around for the meeting, which the executive council may want to avoid. “The President is supposed to chair the NEC, but from the feelers we have for now, he might not be available on Friday, so the meeting might have to be shifted. However, the National Caucus meeting will hold on Thursday,” the source said.  Corroborating the sources, the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said Friday had been set for the NEC meeting. He added: “Yes, the meeting is scheduled, tentatively, for Friday.”
