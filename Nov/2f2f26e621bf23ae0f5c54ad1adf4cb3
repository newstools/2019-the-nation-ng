Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa  Two Policemen were on Tuesday shot dead by unknown gunmen along the Otuogidi community in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. The hoodlums carted away the riffles of their victims creating apprehension in the state few days to the Saturday governorship election. But the 32,000 policemen detailed by the Inspector-General of Police to monitor the election began arriving in the state. The activities of the policemen were to be supervised by 15 Commissioners of Police, three Assistant Inspectors-General (AIG) of Police and the Deputy Inspectors-General of Police (DIG) deployed in the state for the poll. Some of the Commissioners of Police are Garba Baba Umar, Sanusi Buba, Bello Makwashi, Usman Sule Gomina, Mohammed Gimba, Bashir Makama, Habu Sani and Danladi Bitrus Lalas, Omololu Bishi, Joseph Mukan and an Acting Police Commissioner Odumosu Olusegun among others. It was gathered that the attack on the policemen occurred at a checkpoint close to the Bayelsa State College of Health Technology located in Ogbia. The attack reportedly left one of the policemen dead on the spot while the second policeman died at an undisclosed hospital. But the DIG of Police on Bayelsa Election, Anthony Ogbizi , assured the people of the State of their safety and promised that the security personnel would ensure level-playing ground for the INEC to conduct a free, fair and credible election. Also speaking, Bishi called on the people to come out en masse to cast their votes for their preferred candidates on Saturday election. “Anybody that wins the election is a son of the soil and not a stranger. There is no need for anyone to fight because no office is worth the blood of the people”, he said.
