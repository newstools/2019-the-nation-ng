From Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti  Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has told his appointees to be prepared to make sacrifices in a bid to make the state great. He advised the appointees to see themselves as representatives of their communities, adding that they should ensure they make impact on the lives of the people in their immediate environment. The governor gave the advice in Ikogosi Ekiti at a retreat organised for the Senior Special Assistants and Special Assistants serving in capacities in the government. He said his administration is doing everything to ensure that the appointees function effectively and efficiently. Dr. Fayemi, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Hon. Biodun Oyebanji, enjoined the appointees to perform and deliver on their mandates. He urged them to keep themselves abreast of the agenda of the government and key into the programmes aimed at making life better for the Ekiti. The Chief of Staff, Mr. Biodun Omoleye, said the people’s expectations about the government are high, “especially now that they have chosen high degree of integrity rather than the perishables and worthless Greek gifts”, hence the appointees must rise to the task of being Fayemi’s good ambassadors in their communities. He said the retreat would be used to right the wrongs and send signals that the body of SSAs/SAs are ready to impact positively on the lives of Ekiti people.
