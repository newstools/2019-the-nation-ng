Gabriel Ogunjobi House of Representatives member, Bamidele Salam has challenged the minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola to opt for transportation by road for all his local trips in the next three months. The lawmaker representing Ede federal constituency also asked all concerned stakeholders to pick up same challenge so as to arrive at a better evaluation of Nigerian road infrastructure. Salam made this request in reaction to Fashola’s statement on Wednesday differing ‘the roads not as bad as they are often portrayed’ while the latter addressed state house correspondents after the federal executive council meeting. “I found this statement, which had been repeated by the Hon Minister at least on two previous occasions as a clear indication that some of us in public offices are not at all in tune with the horrendous realities of our fellow citizens daily experience. As a member of the House of Representatives committee on Works, I will be throwing a road travel challenge to the Hon Minister and all persons concerned to avoid air travel for all local trips in the next 90 days!”, the lawmaker partly said in a statement personally signed on Wednesday evening. “If we will agree to this challenge, we may come back with a better appreciation of the true state of our road infrastructure and the desperate things we need to do to save our economy from further disruptions as a result of the burgeoning crisis in the road transportation sector! Over to the Hon Minister,” he further stressed.
