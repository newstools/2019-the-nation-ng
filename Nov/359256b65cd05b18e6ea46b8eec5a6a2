 SUPER Eagles survived an early scare to claim a 2-1 win over hard-fighting Squirrels of Benin at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo, Akwa Ibom on Wednesday in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) qualifying game. The Squirrels fired the first salvo as early as the 3rd minute through Stephane Sessegnon and maintained their lead till the dying minutes of the first half when Lille forward Victor Osimhen converted a penalty to level scores just before the end of first 45 minutes. Resumption of hostilities in the second half saw the Eagles making better passes and playing more purposeful football which yielded a goal in the 63rd minute when Bordeaux ace Samuel Kalu grabbed Nigeria’s second goal thanks to an impressive shot that caught the Squirrels goalkeeper unawares. Kalu’s goal threw the massive crowd at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium into frenzy as the drumming and singing took a new dimension. The Eagles created ample chances that would have given the team the third goal but for the Beninese goalkeeper Farnolle who made breath-taking saves to thwart the Eagles. Meanwhile ,Eagles opponents in the second game of the qualifier billed for Sunday, Crocodiles of Lesotho played a 1-1 draw against Sierra Leone in Freetown. The Gernot Rohr-tutored side will depart Nigeria on Friday for the battle of Maseru.
