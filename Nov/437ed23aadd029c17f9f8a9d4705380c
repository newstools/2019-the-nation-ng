Osagie Otabor, Benin  The crisis in rocking the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress got messier on Wednesday as factions of the party rectified suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Governor Godwin Obaseki, and others. At a meeting of APC leaders at the party secretariat, the suspension of Oshiomhole and some party local government chairmen were upheld. The suspension of Obaseki, his Deputy, Philip Shaibu and others were carried out at the residence of General Charles Airhiavbere by the Edo Peoples Movement, a pressure group within the APC.
