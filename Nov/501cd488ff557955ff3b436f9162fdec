KANYE West has a dream. That dream? To legally change his name to ‘Christian Genius Billionaire’ and run for President of the United States. The rapper, who recently released his ninth studio album Jesus Is King, turned up at the fifth annual Fast Company Innovation Festival in New York this week to speak alongside Yeezy footwear designer Steven Smit. “Martin Luther King didn’t get killed because he had a dream; he had something else he was going to talk about,” he said, according to report. “He talked about black empowerment, economic empowerment,” West added. “When I did Forbes, I showed them a $890 million (£768m) receipt and they still didn’t say ‘billionaire’. They don’t want us to know that we can buy land; they don’t want us to have the 100% ownership [that] I have at Yeezy… “When people say it’s crass to call yourself a billionaire, I say I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y’all understand exactly what it is… It will be on the license plate.” West wants to follow in the footsteps of Donald Trump by running for President.
