For every kingdom, there must be a king. It is also customary that once a king goes to sleep, another one emerges. Late Oba Idowu Oniru has been given a befitting burial – a ceremony that ended with a classy reception at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. The party had in attendance politicians, businessmen, corporate captains, first-class monarchs and celebrities. But since Oba Oniru passed on, everyone has been quiet about who succeeds him.  Social Circuit learnt that while people being careful about the matter, there is a silent race among the ruling houses. The source stated: “All the ruling houses are already showing their interest and taking necessary steps. There is a controversy on the ground, so everyone is being careful.”
