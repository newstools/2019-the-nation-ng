Kolade Adeyemi, Kano  The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano state has slammed the opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) over a false alarm it raised in a statement alleging plan to influence the choice of Court of Appeal judges who will seat on appeal on Kano governorship election. It said allegation made against the APC, its candidate, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and also to blackmail the Appeal Court by the PDP, clearly indicated that the opposition party is jittery, confused and afraid of possible loss at the Court. A statement signed by the commissioner of information, Malam Muhammad Garba, on Monday, stated that even if happened, it is the discretion of the court to decide who presides over its proceedings, saying, however, the fundamental issue is for justice to prevail. The statement noted that it had always been the trademark of the PDP to spread falsehood in the face of imminent loss of court cases as they did in Kano state during the legal battle at the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal and the Presidential election case. It further explained that it is unfortunate that the opposition party who resorted to legal means to redress its grievances could be careless to the extent of making unfounded allegation against the judicial process. Garba added that while it is not a crime for the APC members to have confidence in the outcome of the Appeal Court judgment, the party and its candidate have no intention whatsoever to disrupt the judicial process. The commissioner said that Kano has been peaceful and there is no indication of any tension as alleged by the PDP, saying that government will not condone any act that is capable of inciting violence through reckless, unguided and indiscriminate statements that are inimical to the peace that APC has allowed the opposition to enjoy in our dear state for more than five years. It could be recalled that PDP had accused the APC and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of plotting to change the Judges, that are already assigned to preside over the Kano State Governorship election Appeal Panel. The Party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, had in statement, alleged that there are ” plots to replace the Judges with pliable ones, who have been compromised and briefed to alter Justice and do the bidding of the APC and Governor Ganduje”.
