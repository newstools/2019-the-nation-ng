 THE new Kano State Police Commissioner, Ahmadu Abu Sani has said his administration will modernise policing in the state, using intelligence and crime analysis methods. He told reporters, “We will adopt all technical and intelligence-driven investigation in our operations to strike the criminals out of circulation,” adding that he will “discard the analogue system of policing in Kano State.” Sani said the analogue police system is no longer tenable in a scientific world. He warned criminals to desist from their nefarious activities, stressing that he has declared war against criminality, and that there is no hiding place for criminals in the state. Sani expressed disgust at the high rate of drug abuse, which he said is a factor in the commission of crime among youths.
