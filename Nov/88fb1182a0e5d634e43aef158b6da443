Management of the University of Benin has placed a ban on all social activities on campus following Fridayâ€™s killing of a 200-level student simply identified as Aficionado. Aficionado was shot dead at about 6pm during the jean carnival organised for final-year students of the Faculty of Arts at the Twin-Lecture Theatre. Spokesman for the university, Mr. Micheal Osasuyi, who spoke on measures taken to avert reprisal attacks, said security agents have been placed on red alert. Osasuyi said ban was also placed on all social activities. The killing of Aficionado was said to have caused panic as students scampered for safety when they heard gunshots. His body was later found lying on the ground. Sources said many students have fled their hostels while heavy security presence was noticed around the campus.
