Chris Oji, Enugu  The Integrated Personal Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) enrollment for university teachers was yet to start at the University of Nigeria in both the main campus at Nsukka and the Enugu campus. A top administrative staff of the university hinted that they were putting finishing touches to the modalities of the exercise which kicked off on Monday. He said the exercise would be done through faculties and that a number of lecturers of the university had made enquiries on modalities, which gave the indication that many of the lecturers would defy the ASUU directive not to comply. The University of Nigeria branch chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr Christian Opata who earlier last week insisted that teachers at university would stick to the instructions of the national secretariat to disregard the enrollment exercise could not be reached for update. As of the time of filing this report, Opata was not picking his calls and would not reply to text messages. However, some of the lecturers who spoke to our correspondent said their enrollment or not would depend on the conditions spelt out in the guidelines which they were yet to see. One of them said: “Until we see the conditions, and weigh the advantage and disadvantage, then we will take decision whether to enrol or not, the ASUU directive notwithstanding.”
