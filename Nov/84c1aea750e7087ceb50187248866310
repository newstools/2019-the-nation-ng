 MEMBER of the National Peace Committee (NPC), Archbishop Mathew Hassan Kukah, Governor Seriake Dickson and other stakeholders have called on political parties to maintain peace during Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa State. Rev. Kukah spoke at a Peace Accord signing event organised by the NPC in partnership with the Niger Delta Dialogue (NDD) at the DSP Alamieyeseigha Memorial Banquet Hall in Yenagoa. Kukah, who is the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese and Secretary of the NPC, underscored the importance of peace during and after the election. He urged Nigerians, especially the people of Bayelsa, to imbibe the political culture of tolerance and peace while exercising their franchise, insisting that only the living could enjoy the dividends of democracy. “As you know, not all Bayelsans are members of a political party, not every member of a political party is Bayelsan. It is on your behalf that this election is being conducted. I want to enjoin you to imbibe the spirit that only the living can participate in elections and enjoy the dividends of elections,” he said. On her part, the Convener of the Niger Delta Dialogue, Dr. Judith Asuni, said 26 candidates in the forthcoming governorship elections signed the peace accord and urged them to be committed to the initiative. Also speaking, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Monday Udom, said INEC was ready to conduct free, fair and credible election in Bayelsa. “INEC Bayelsa  is doing all it could to ensure that on November 16 we shall file out and vote without molestation, shortage of materials and smart card failures,” he said.
