 DEPUTY governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Saturday’s election in Bayelsa State, Senator Degi Biobarakuma, on Thursday expressed shock over Tuesday’s Federal High Court judgment in Abuja, which disqualified him. He said the judgment was based on speculation, describing it as a travesty of justice. Biobarakuma, in a statement, urged his supporters not to be deterred by this development, adding that they should come out on Saturday to vote for the APC, because the status quo still remained. He said it was illogical to declare that simply because there were variations in his names as shown in his qualifying certificates, he had been disqualified without a proper inquiry by an evidential trial to confirm the authenticity of the claim. The deputy governorship candidate said he took steps to correct the false impression, even though the plaintiff who made the assertion did not substantiate it. He said: “Upon being served with the court processes, I quickly denied the allegation of presenting false information to INEC, by deposing to a counter affidavit wherein I clearly stated the circumstances leading to the variation forming the plaintiff’s complaint. I equally applied to the court to summon the West African Examination Council (WAEC) and Government Secondary School, Anyama, Ogbia, Bayelsa State, to come with the particulars, including photograph of the actual individual who sat for these examinations in order to ascertain whether it is any different from me. He said it was intriguing that though a case of forgery could not be established against him, the judge proceeded to declare that his conduct was fraudulent and proceeded to disqualify him on the bases of unfounded allegations.
