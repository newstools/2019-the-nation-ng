Real Madrid attacker Gareth Bale says that he finds it more exciting to play for Wales than for the Spanish giants. Having already courted controversy in Spain this season due to his attitude, the 30-year-old has risked upsetting fans of the club further by indicating that he prefers featuring for his country. Indeed, Bale has not featured for Los Blancos since sustaining a calf injury on international duty in October but has found his fitness in time to travel with Ryan Giggs’ side for a Euro 2020 qualifier against Azerbaijan on Saturday. “I definitely have more excitement playing for Wales,” the former Tottenham star indicated. “I’ve been with most of the older players since we were in the U17s. It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday. It’s normal. “With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. But it doesn’t change what I do on the pitch. “I always give 100 per cent on the pitch wherever I am, that’s what I always strive to do.”
