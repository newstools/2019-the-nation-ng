No fewer than 13 students of the Kogi State University (KSU), Ayingba were killed over the weekend in clashes between suspected cult members. The killings were said to have started when a student of Kogi State Polytechnic (KSP) Lokoja, suspected to be a kingpin of a cult group, was reportedly killed. The killing by a rival cult group at state university triggered a reprisal attack. The rival group was alleged to have threatened to kill 12 students in retaliation. Eyewitnesses said the KSU killings began last Friday when three students were hacked down on the campus. Nine others, including a 200 Level student and her boyfriend were said to have been killed at other points. Some of the killings, it was learnt, took place around the Stadium Road and Our Lady Fatima lodge, where the victims were said to have been brutally murdered and dismembered. Among those killed were Oloruntoba Godwin, a 300 Level student of Geography, and Ajileye Richard of the Department of Accountancy (200 Level). Both of them were said to be indegenes of Ijumu Local Government Area of the state. Some of the injured were said to be rushed to hospital, while the student population was said to be panicky and many suddenly travelled out of town. The school Public Relations  Officer (PRO), Joseph Edegbo, said he could not comment on the issue, saying it was “very sensitive.” Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr. Hakeem Busari who confirmed the killings, said  three students were killed. He said no arrest had yet been made, but that a crack team of detectives had been drafted to the school.
