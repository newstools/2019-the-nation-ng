CONTESTANTS in the ongoing entrepreneurial reality TV show, The Next Titan, visited Coscharis Motors at its Ford office on Victoria Island, Lagos. They were received by the company’s Group General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Abiona Babarinde. Babarinde said the auto company was excited to support the Next Titan reality show. Henry Ford once said that ‘a business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.’ The show, he said, aligns with Ford’s objective as a corporate citizen to support Nigeria’s upcoming business owners with entrepreneurial skills that will make a contribution to the economy and for them to lead by example. “Since the inception of its participation in Next Titan, Coscharis Motors and Ford are proud to have given previous winners, over the past four seasons, Ford vehicles to help run their business. This year, the business will continue the momentum and give the winner of Season 6 a brand new Ford Figo. “Coscharis Motors wishes all participants the best of luck for the competition, We believe that the current contestants will both inspire young entrepreneurs, and educate society on just how much hard work goes into growing a business. They will push themselves to the limit, digging deep into their minds to discover and exhibit their true entrepreneurial potentials. According to Dr Cosmas Maduka, founder of Coscharis Group, we really don’t know who we are until we see what we can do.” Executive Producer of the show, Mide Kunle-Akinlaja thanked the organisation for their support. “Participation in the reality show year after year only demonstrates Coscharis Motors’ and Ford’s commitment towards emerging entrepreneurs,” he said.
