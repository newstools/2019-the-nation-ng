Kelvin Osa Okunbor  Sack fever has gripped workers of Medview Airlines over plans by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to withdraw its Air Operating Certificate (AOC) over prolonged shutdown  of scheduled operations. The NCAA, a source hinted, is not comfortable with the development around the carrier which shut down scheduled operations about three months ago owing to prolonged stay of its operating aircraft at a maintenance facility. A worker with the airline  said: “Despite efforts by the management, there is no hope on the horizon. “We learnt that the NCAA will withdraw the licence by November 10. Everyone is afraid. I know some colleagues that had simply sought new jobs and moved on. Even me, I have been submitting my résumé for jobs lately. Nobody seems to understand what the CEO is doing with the airline.” The NCAA has  confirmed the licence withdrawal threat. Its spokesperson, Sam Adurogboye, said in line with the provisions of the civil aviation regulation, the airline’s operation had been downgraded to non-scheduled operations as a stop-gap measure to keep the airline running till its gets out of the woods. Unlike scheduled operation that requires a minimum of two aircraft according to Nig. CARs, non-scheduled or chartered allows for an aircraft. Adurogboye added that the airline has till November end to begin chartered operations; otherwise, its operating licence would be withdrawn in accordance to the rules. “The position of NCAA on Med-View is they should ensure that they start using their AOC for charter operations only between now and November ending. Failure to which their AOC will lapse in line with the provisions of Nig. CARs,” he said. An expert familiar with the matter said the NCAA has downgraded its status to that of a charter operator  in line with requisite provisions in the Civil Aviation Regulations (CAR).
