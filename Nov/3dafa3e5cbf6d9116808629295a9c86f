FORMER Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger returned to football yesterday  after being named FIFA’s chief of global football development, ending any chance of a move to manageress Bayern Munich. FIFA said the former Arsenal and Monaco coach would be responsible for the growth of the game “for both men and women around the world”, and would also be the “leading authority on technical matters”, including potential changes to the sport’s laws. It added that Wenger, 70, would also be tasked with coach education and aiding a programme designed to help former players enter management. “I very much look forward to taking on this extremely important challenge,” Wenger said in a statement. “Not only because I have always been interested in analysing football from a broader perspective but also because FIFA’s mission as world football’s governing body is truly global.”
