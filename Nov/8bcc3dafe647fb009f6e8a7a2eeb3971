 Despite their listless performance at the 2019 FIFA Beach World Cup holding in Paraguay, the Sand Eagles are threatening fire and brimstones over unpaid allowances. The coach  Audu Adamu-led  side  were beaten black and blue  as they suffered in two  cricket score defeats to  Portugal (10-1) and (Brazil 12-2) as well as losing 6-5 to Oman 6-5 to finish  the tournament without a win and pointless. But the captain of the team, Abu Azeez has lamented over the team’s shabby treatment over the years by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), adding the team was not motivated to do well in Paraguay. “Copa Lagos and World Cup are not enough to motivate a player even if we are playing for the badge. I think the team lacked attention and needs proper technical management. Some of our good players were dropped for being old,” the 25-year-old Azeez opened the Pandora Box on his Instagram (@officialazeez) account. He continued: “But it seems the poor arrangement is affecting the players. We got into camp on October 21 to prepare for Copa Lagos. We played Copa Lagos on November 1 to 3 and we stayed in camp again till November 8. We were paid N20, 000 only. We got to Paraguay on November 10 till date and we were entitled to 19 days allowance. “I was almost dropped in 2016 because I complained that we have not been paid. We were in Bahamas for the World Cup in 2017 and we were paid N150, 000 only,” he said.
