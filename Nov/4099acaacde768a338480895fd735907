Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has a word of advice for governors who claim they cannot implement the consequential adjustment as a result of the N30,000 new minimum wage. Stop spending money on frivolities, the union told them. In a joint statement on Sunday in Abuja by its President Quadri Olaleye and Secretary General Musa-Lawal Ozigi, to mark today’s Mawlud Nabbiyy holiday, TUC said it may be forced to act if the governors do not perform. The statement said: “That the economy is ailing and the organised labour is not willing to cause more harm. However, we may be forced to act if the governors do not perform.” The labour leaders urged Muslims to abide by the teachings of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH), which they said border on piety, charity, tolerance and peaceful co-existence, among others. According to the statement, if Nigerians read the holy books and live by their tenets, the country will be a better place. The union noted that the problem of the country had never been about religion. It regretted that the nation’s unity, once cherished, was no longer there because of politics. “At this time of the country’s national life, it has become very imperative for all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious backgrounds, to cooperate with the progressives in the country to transform and make the country fulfil its manifest destiny. “Until we uphold the above stated virtues with a view to overcoming our current national challenges we cannot achieve much as ineffectiveness, mediocrity, backstabbing and impunity have become the order of the day.” “There are too many absurdities in our clime. The unity we once cherished is no longer there because of politics,” the statement said.
