 A Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) officer, Ola Oyeshina, was on Friday evening attacked by hoodlums in the course of sanitizing the Iganmu-Sifax axis of the Apapa access road. A large stone was hauled at him, knocking him down immediately. He fell but was immediately evacuated to Area “B” Police headquarters where ACP Bayo Sulaimon ordered the detention of two of his attackers who were later arrested, while a letter of medical referral was issued by the police for medical attention on the victim. Owing to the trauma, Oyeshina was immediately referred to LUTH from Randle Hospital, Surulere. The Vice Chairman of the Federal Government Task Team on the restoration of order at Apapa, Comrade Kayode Opeifa, said he was with the victim at the Emergency Section of LUTH where he was being attended to. It is not the first time that LASTMA officials have been harassed, attacked or killed by hoodlums at Apapa. In 2016, a LASTMA commander was brutally killed by hoodlums over disagreements on traffic control. The development forced the Lagos State Government to withdraw the services of LASTMA from Apapa. The Federal Government in May this year approved the return of LASTMA after staying away for three years, and the agency had been hesitant in returning to area. Opeifa, however, said Oyeshina was responding to treatment.
