 NOLLYWOOD actress, Tana Adelana has asked her followers to put her through on where and how to read the Holy Quran. The actress, who recently won the Best Actress of the year (English) at the City People Awards, revealed on her Instagram page that she just downloaded the Holy Quran. However, it seems the actress is seeking a guide to navigate the holy book for comprehension. “My latest download,” she wrote. “Islam is violent, Islam encourages evil, Islam does not promote world peace… I heard all these and more while growing up and the list is endless. “What doesn’t add up is; I have Muslim friends who have been the opposite of what I’ve heard. Where my Muslim followers at? Do I need a guide to read the Holy Quran? Are there verses I must read even if I can’t read all? Are there verses I must stay away from? I’d appreciate your help”. Tana has also been nominated at the sixth edition of the GMYT African Humanitarian Awards and Fashion Show in the Best Actress in a leading role category. The event will hold on December 6 at Oriental Oiental Hotel, Lagos.
