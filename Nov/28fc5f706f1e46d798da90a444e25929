Nigeria forward Henry Onyekuru has turned down overtures from Russian giants, CSKA Moscow and Locomotiv Moscow, preferring a loan return to Galatasaray of Turkey. Onyekuru has struggled for regular playing time at French Ligue 1 club, Monaco this season following his summer arrival from Everton. The versatile forward has made four league appearances for the principality club and is down the pecking order with the trio of Wissam Ben Yedder, Islam Slimani and Gelson Martin coach Leonardo Jardim’s preferred choices in attack. Monaco are reportedly willing to allow the former Anderlecht striker leave on loan for a fee around 2.5m Euros. “I will return to my old team (Galatasaray) without thinking. I don’t want to go to Russia ,” he said.
