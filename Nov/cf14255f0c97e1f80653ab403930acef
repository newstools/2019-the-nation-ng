The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Elders Forum has denounced the alleged role of former President Goodluck Jonathan in the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. In a statement in Yenagoa, the state capital, the forumâ€™s Chairman Chief Benson Odoko said the action of the former President indicated that he supported the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the election. He added that Dr Jonathan, who visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja before the election, kept his distance from the PDP throughout the campaigns. Odoko recalled that the ex-President also refused to congratulate the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri, who was Commissioner for Sports when Jonathan was governor.
