Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  Kwara State branch of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) yesterday cautioned the national body against imposition of a caretaker chairman on its union. The union has inaugurated its newly elected 18-member executives led by Alhaji AbdulRazak Ariwoola. He is succeeding Isa Ore, now the state chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). Before the inauguration of the new executives, the state Secretary of NURTW, Nurudeen Opoola, told the gathering of the intention of the national secretariat to send caretaker committee members to run the affairs of the union pending the election of another executives of its choice. It was gathered that 16 of the new executive members emerged through consensus arrangement, while the chairman and his deputy emerged through balloting. But some members of the union kicked against the idea, thus necessitating the National President of the union, Tajudeen Baruwa, to tinker with caretaker committee for the state.
