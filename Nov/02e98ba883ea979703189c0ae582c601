Business titan, Mike Adenuga’s daughter, Bella Disu, keeps showing all that what a man can do a woman can do better. As the Vice-Chairman of Globalcom, she literally runs its affairs and has held her own in the league of top business persons. A few days ago, she completed a luxurious high rise that has 18 units of serviced apartments. The building – Sisi Pari – described by Disu as a unique and unmatchable apartment complex, is located in Ikoyi, Lagos. While this is a little feat compared to her father’s achievements, it speaks a lot about Disu. If not anything, it shows that she is building her own legacy.
