The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps, Brig Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has advised serving corps members who will take part in the November 16 Governorship election in Bayelsa state to think of their safety first in terms of crisis. The DG urged corps members who will serve as adhoc workers during the election to “run for your dear lives in case of any emergency and don’t endanger your safety.” The DG admonished the corps members to be security-conscious and look for escape routes in case of emergency. “Be courteous when dealing with the electorates, caution yourself when provoked and ensure that your phone is fully charged with enough call cards during the election,” he said. The DG spoke in a statement issued by Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, Director, Press and Public Relations, NYSC headquarters Abuja, on Friday. The NYSC boss, in collaboration with the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, also warned the corps members to abide by the electoral laws during the election. Mahmood urged them to avoid actions that may undermine the integrity of the election. The INEC chairman revealed that adequate security has been provided for all corps members and corps lodges in the state during and after the election. Mahmood, who described corps members as the most reliable, dedicated and committed electoral officers, promised prompt payment of all their entitlements through their bank accounts. The NYSC DG, on the other hand, said the involvement of corps members in the country’s electoral system had added more credibility to previous elections. He described corps members as “patriotic Nigerians on National Assignment that deserves proper welfare from every Nigerian.” He added: “Be neutral and non-partisan because NYSC would not tolerate and Corps Member that violate the Electoral Act.”
