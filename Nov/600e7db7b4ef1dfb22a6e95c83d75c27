 AS part of activities to mark its 37th anniversary holding in November, FoodCo Nigeria Limited, a diversified consumer goods company with interests in retail, quick service restaurants, entertainment and manufacturing, has announced a series of customer reward initiatives to appreciate loyal customers for being an integral part of the brand story over the years. The campaign, tagged, ‘My FoodCo Story,’ will chronicle the brand journey since inception in 1982 and encourage customers to share their most memorable experiences with the company, including available memorabilia. It will run for 15 days from November 1-16, 2019 to coincide with launch activities for the 9th FoodCo outlet opened recently in Lekki, Lagos. Justifying the need for the initiative, Ade Sun-Basorun, Chief Executive Officer Designate, FoodCo, said: “We are happy to announce the start of activities commemorating our 37th anniversary in November. This year’s event is a special one for us as it also marks our market entry into Lagos. It promises to be an exciting period because we will be throwing parties for our customers born in the month of November. We are also going to be giving them an opportunity to share some of the memorable experiences that they have shared with the brand over our 37-year sojourn. “We are a 37-year-old institution and part of a small group of consumer goods companies that created the formal retail sector in Nigeria. Our journey began from a small stall in Bodija, Ibadan, Oyo State where we sold fresh vegetables and meat in hygienic conditions as an alternative for people who did not want to go through the hassles of shopping in the open markets. From inception, our business has been about providing customers their full range of needs at affordable prices.   jillokeke@yahoo.com, 07069429757, 08158610847
