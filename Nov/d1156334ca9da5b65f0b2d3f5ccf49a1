The Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) has assured telecom consumers that they would continue to get the right value for their cash. It added that it would continue to address challenges in the industry. Its Executive Vice Chairman/CEO, Prof. Umar Danbatta, who spoke at NCC Day at Lagos International Trade Fair Complex, Tafawa Balewa Square, said as the regulator of the industry, the Commission is aware of the huge responsibilities of safeguarding the interests of all the stakeholders. Represented by the Commission’s Deputy Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau, Mr. Ismail Adedigba, he said the forum was specially organised to strategise with the consumers to seek and proffer solutions to various telecom issues confronting them. He said: “The NCC as the telecom regulator is aware that this feat of telecom being central to our daily life could not have been achieved without the consumers and as such identifies the Consumer as a very important stakeholder in the telecom industry. “This is evident in the Eight Point Agenda  of the Commission where the empowerment and protection of the consumers from unfair practices through availability of information and education to make informed choices in the use of ICT services is emphasised.” The EVC  said the NCC as a regulator has devised ways for subscribers to lodge complaints when you are dissatisfied with the services provided by your operator, and the Commission will also apply appropriate regulatory measures and sanctions against such service provider. He said one of the issues affecting telecoms consumers which the Commission has proffered solution to is the issue of telemarketing, commonly known as unsolicited text message.
