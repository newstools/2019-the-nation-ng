 DEFENDING champion, Bose Odusanya will clash with 2013 champion, Tolu Durosimi-Etti as the women’s singles of the 51st Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Cup enter the semi-final stage today at the Teslim Balogun Stadium. Already, both players have started talking tough with Odusanya stating her desire to hold on to the title. “I think I beat her when I won my first title in 2015 and this year will not be an exception. I hope to take her down again. I am in good shape and I don’t see anybody stopping me from winning my fifth title,” a confident Odusanya said. As a prelude to today’s game, Odusanya partnership with David Fayele conquered Durosimi-Etti and Samson Agbaje 11-4, 11-4, 11-9 to emerge winners of the mixed doubles event. Also in the men’s singles, former national junior star, Joseph Osendukwu is aiming to end the reign of Fayele as both players battle in the quarterfinal of the men’s single today.    A determined Osendukwu said: “I don’t see him reigning for long and I think I am fully ready to stop him from parading himself as champion. He is going down and I am fully in top shape to ensure I stop him from retaining the title,” he said.
