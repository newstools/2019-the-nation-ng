Olaniran said that the decision to boycott academic activities was reached after reviewing the situation regarding the non-payment of three months salaries to the lecturers. He said that ASUU had earlier issued an ultimatum to the university management to pay the lecturers their outstanding salaries or face industrial action. According to the ASUU chairman, apart from boycott of lectures, results of rain semester will be withheld, while the project defence by final year students will be put on hold.  (NAN)
