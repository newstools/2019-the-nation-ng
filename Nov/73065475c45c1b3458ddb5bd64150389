Prince Chris Ogan is one of the partners at Jadeas Trust Consortium, the company at the centre of the controversy in the National Arts Theatre project saga. In this interview with Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf, he provides useful insights on the raging controversy. Excerpts:  THE media has been awash with reports about the takeover of the National Arts Theatre by the CBN, which your company, Jadeas Trust Consortium is contesting. When did your company come into the picture? This is a journey which began in 2002 and along the way, has succeeded in assembling an unrivalled team of local and international partners, who have signed up in good faith and collectively have the necessary financial and technical capacity to transform this moribund national asset into a world class city centre development. We have reached out to the CBN and Bankers Committee to explain that the role of the consortia is that of master developers to the project, meaning that we will provide a holistic and sustainable master plan which balances cultural and entertainment facilities with the commercial facilities necessary to ensure the projects long term viability.  This master plan is the essential blueprints that will enable a variety of interested parties express their interest in developing any of the several business units which make up this development. We remain optimistic that the CBN and Banker’s Committee will see this as an important platform for the development of the creative and digital industries’ one that will take this sector to the next level and which deserves to be supported rather than rubbished. The CBN is an agent of government. So it’s only certain that the apex bank may have received the nod of the government to take over the National Arts Theatre as you have expressly stated? The Federal Government agencies responsible for the privatisation/concessioning of Federal Government assets are the BPE and ICRC, under the supervision of the National Council on Privatisation, chaired by the Vice President. None of these agencies and even the Ministry of Culture and Board of the National Theatre are aware of the purported takeover of the asset by the CBN. The only clause is if the consortium is unable to fund the project after two years of signing the concession agreement. What the CBN Governor is purporting to do under the guise of “ the Presidency “ is a breach of due process and particularly surprising given the stance of the Presidency on respect for probity and rule of law. Given that the Presidency was responsible for the mediation that resulted in the MoU between the two preferred bidders, we do not believe they will in good conscience trample over the laudable outcome of a process which they were instrumental in midwifing. According to the CBN, over one million job stands to be generated once the park comes on stream. What are bringing into the table, in terms of job creation and others? One of consortiums which enjoys an internationally recognised expertise in providing innovative platforms for the creative and digital industries, received a grant from the World Bank to provide business development support to the over 60 SMEs in the creative industries that work out of the Artists Village of the NCAC. Meanwhile, the other has been able to raise over $2b for the project. Long term 14,000 jobs. Mid-term-7000. Construction stage- 4000. Interestingly, as a member of the international panel of jurors on Creative Clusters, they have also produced festivals abroad that featured Pan African artists, while curating travelling exhibitions abroad that featured the work of our local creatives. With this background, the planned development will guarantee jobs for more than 500,000 practitioners within the creative and digital industries at full maturity.  Along with world class educational facilities to provide the training that is essential for the jobs of the future in this important sector. The employment opportunities that will be provided by this project started at the project development stage which has had substantial input from local professionals.  A Construction Charter is in place that guarantees community stewardship, upskilling, training and development of local artisans. This will ensure that they are prime beneficiaries in the ongoing construction process of this project. Besides, given that National Theatre was built to host Festac 77, which remains till date the largest and most successful gathering of Africans to be held on the continent and in diaspora, the project is returning to these roots with a global Africa focus. The Board will comprise of leading lights from all over Africa and the diaspora to reflect the spirit of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA) and enable Nigeria play a leadership role in this historic new movement. Topwide Apeas Limited – is 80% Nigerian 20% foreigners and there will be more local content in the estimated ratio of 95% local & 5% foreign in the projects.
