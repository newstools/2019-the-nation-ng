Akeem Lawal  The Nigeria Boxing Federation [NBF] has revealed that the country’s maiden edition of boxing league tagged ‘Nigeria Boxing Series’ will commence on December 7. NBF which is affiliated to International Amateur Boxing Association said the league would see four teams: Delta Force, Team Lagos, Sea Warriors and De Rocks battling for six weeks. President, Nigeria Boxing Federation (NBF), General Kenneth Minimah (rtd) hinted at the NBS Season One seminar held at the Brai Ayonote Boxing Complex National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos that this year edition would be a tip of iceberg. “This idea is part of the development Nigeria boxing needs. If you have followed Nigeria boxing from the glorious days to now, you will understand what I am talking about. We have been challenged by poor performances in international competitions. “Therefore, we have to keep the boxers busy. Some other sports are doing the same by engaging their athletes through weekly programmes. Some call it league and some give it other names. So we decided to start fashioning out a way to engage our boxers.” In the same vein, NBF board member representing the South South and the Chairman of the Boxing Series, Azania Omo-Agege said the competition is aimed at encouraging the athletes and make the boxers to be in form at all times. “We will be fighting every two weeks with four registered teams. We have eight different boxing categories. So we will be having eight boxers from each group fighting in the eight weight groups,” said Omo-Agege, who is also the Senior Special Assistant on Youth and Sports Development to the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege.
