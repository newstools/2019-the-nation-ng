James Azania, Lokoja With the close of the Kogi West supplementary poll, sorting and counting of votes at the polling units, results have been moved to the Local Government collation centres. As the results from the polling units are trickling in, the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Smart Adeyemi appears to be in a clear lead, ahead of the incumbent Senator Dino Melaye, who in unofficial results is trailing the former with wide margins. In the Ajaokuta Federal Constituency rerun, the APC candidate also in unofficial results appears to be in clear lead ahead of the candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Until the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officially announce the winner later today or on Sunday, celebration by the supporters of the APC candidates who are already congratulating themselves, may have to be put on hold.
