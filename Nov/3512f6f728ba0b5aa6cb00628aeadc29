Nigeria used to be a major producer of palm oil when agriculture was the mainstay of the economy. However, ever since the discovery of oil in commercial quantities in the 50s, the country’s oil power production has been underwhelming. The current economic reality presents the urgent need to revamp oil palm production in the country, writes JULIANA AGBO Despite the availability of over three million hectares of farmland for palm oil cultivation, production remains low at close to two tons per hectare, relative to a global benchmark of 25 tons per hectare. This is as a result of the maturation of existing palm trees, as some of these trees with the optimum usual life cycle of 25 years, were planted in the 50s, as well as low investment in replanting high-yielding oil palm seeds. Nigeria’s annual palm oil consumption is estimated at 2.4 million metric tons. Report shows that in the first quarter of 2019, the country imported a total of 112, 480 metric tons of palm oil. The Nation reports that the major oil palm producing states include Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Ondo, Rivers, Ogun, Osun and Oyo states. However, statistics from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows that the country currently produces 1.1 million metric tons. Data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board revealed that in January, Nigeria imported 41,281 tons, 8,532 tons in February, 52,872 tons in March and 9,795 tons in April. Consumption data Report from PWC states that palm oil consumption is expected to reach up to two million metric tons in 2029; with a potential supply gap of up to one million metric tons. The released report at the validation workshop on National Initiatives for Sustainable and Climate-Smart Oil Palm Smallholders organised by Solidaridad West Africa, Nigeria, also stated that there is now an increasing local and foreign demand for palm oil produced in Nigeria. “Demand is still expected to outstrip supply owing to low yield, slow plantation growth and the perennial nature of the oil palm. The gap is likely to be filled by import and smuggling”, PWC stated. It added: “Consumption grew at an average growth rate of 2.9 per cent, mirroring Nigeria’s population growth rate. “This growth trend is projected to continue as palm oil continues to be a major food source for both domestic consumers for local dishes (80 per cent of demand) as well as industrial consumers (20 per cent), who require palm oil for various food and household items.” It further explained that the total consumption of crude palm oil was estimated at 1.6 million metric tons last year, with production put at about 900,000 MT. Need to revamp oil palm production In the circumstances, stakeholders from the sector revealed that they want the Federal Government to draw up strategies in reviving the sector, adding that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Governor Godwin Emiefele declared a single digit interest rate loan, even as he said that the country’s target is to become the third largest producer of palm oil in the world. On the implication of palm oil importation, the National Palm Produce Association of Nigeria (NPPAN) said the importation and illegal smuggling of palm oil is making local producers lose 500 million dollars annually. Reacting to the data from Malaysian Palm Oil Board, the association stated that the country’s estimated production is between 1.7 million and 1.8 million metric tons with an average consumption of 2.4 million tons annually. The state of affairs gives a deficit of about 700,000 tons that are still sourced from other countries. However, Nigerian stakeholders who are calling for a revamp of the industry said thriving oil palm sector is fundamental to Nigeria’s diversification agenda. The National President, Oil Palm Growers’ Association of Nigeria (OPGAN), Igwe Hillary Uche, who said oil palm is a long-term product that needs to be invested in for three to six years before returns are expected, explained that the commodity can easily compete with crude oil and help the economy of Nigeria grow very high if given good attention. Uche said the main challenges oil palm growers are facing include good seedlings from Nigerian Institute for Palm Oil Research (NIFOR). He called on the Federal Government to fund the institute so that they can give healthy seeds to the farmers at subsidised rates. The National President, who said the commodity requires funding and government intervention, said there are many other things involved which he reeled off to be motorised harvesters to harvest palm fruits and good mills so as to bring out the special palm oil which the international market needs. On what the oil palm growers expect from the CBN’s intervention, he said they should start from funding NIFOR so that they can give seedlings out to farmers for early planting. He revealed that before four years, the country will start seeing the dividends. Uche said the country will start exporting palm oil. Continuing, Uche said: “Now that the CBN is planning the modalities of how they are going to intervene, I wish they have started. If they can start now that the rains have not gone far, we can start planting the seedlings. They promised giving us seedlings this month. If they don’t start the programme after this month and if they don’t provide us with the seedlings, how can we start expansion?” In terms of land accessibility, he said as the National President of Oil Palm Growers in 24 states, he is sure of his farmers having enough land for their own expansion, adding that if they can co-operate, they can also help those who don’t have. Uche called on the Federal Government not to involve middle men between the CBN and oil palm growers, saying they would frustrate the efforts of the Federal Government in revamping palm oil production. His words: “We want direct contact. When oil palm produce was sustaining the country’s economy, nobody was intervening then. Because of the capital intensiveness of oil palm production, we need cash, and we are going to monitor it. Like they have designed it, we have clusters of minimum of five farmers and maximum of 10 farmers. Among these clusters, one must have a mill then plantation owners will be supplying the mills to produce enough. So, if these clusters are grouped together, you fund them, they will manage it, and there will be competition in production.” A smallholder farmer from Enugu State, Chidiebere Okafor, said for Nigeria oil palm sector to be sufficient, government and other relevant stakeholders need to change farmers’ mindset, adding that most of the farmers from his state who showed interest in farming following the announcement by government’s support earlier never received any positive response. On the challenges of the sector, Okafor pointed out that the oil palm industry in Nigeria is not well regulated with laws and regulations governing environmental management, forest conservation and sustainability. Okafor said: “These include water management, soil conservation, biological control of pests and reduction of waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address the issue of GHG emissions, which is related to global warming, one can use a Life Cycle Approach (LCA) to develop an inventory of GHG emissions along the entire palm oil supply chain beginning with the cultivation and ending with the determination of palm products.” He said Malaysia, which is regarded as the world’s greatest exporter of palm oil, views mitigation using the LCA as an investment to ensure the sustainable production of palm oil as well as the sustainable competitiveness of palm oil in the global oils and gas market. He said: “Assistance from CBN alone can’t make the country self-sufficient in oil palm production. There is need for science experts to come into the picture before thinking of diversifying the sector. “The problem Nigeria has with improving the sector is not finance, but approach. The country lacks the necessary approach of innovative technology so as to make it easier for smallholder farmers. An agriculture expert, Augustine Akor, reiterated the need to revamp the oil palm sector. Palm oil development has a very significant initial cost and that cost has been a constraint for smallholders. Akor said with more than 40 per cent of global palm oil production coming from smallholder farmers, a focus on developing a smallholder model, instead of rolling out large agro-industrial plantations, will work for the expansion of palm oil across the country. He said: “What we need is a palm oil industry in Nigeria based on secure land rights and this is something we don’t currently have. “We need palm oil industry based on a mixed economy that will satisfy people’s needs, their cultural needs and their income needs. Yes, it will take investment, but not the extractive kind that treats local land as freely available and local people as cheap labour. “Given that average smallholder palm oil yields are significantly lower in Nigeria than in other regions such as Malaysia or Indonesia, smallholder farmers in our country will need support from the private sector if they are to realise the benefits of palm oil expansion. We need to put in the investment and technical assistance so that farmers can get their palm produce to the market at the right price and in right conditions. “We need to keep an open mind, encourage partnership and encourage, especially local players to participate. Civil society must look at how it can support smallholder farmers in meeting the costs of establishing their own plantations.”
