Many rich kids do nothing that stand the test of time. They slither through life, like the proverbial rattlesnake travelling across the rocks without an imprint of its presence on the rocky plains. Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi seems remarkably different, deviating from the status quo. Privileged to have come from a bourgeoisie background, she is the daughter of incumbent Governor of Kano State, Alhaji Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, also married to Idris Ajimobi, son of former Governor of Oyo state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, Fatima has never had cause to look down on the less privileged. Her close associate attests that; if there is one thing Fatima loathes so much, it’s the sight a fellow human in distress she is ever ready to give her. The Special Adviser on NGOs and Civil society to the Speaker House of Representatives, she is a passionate advocate for children. Through her ‘Let’s Talk Humanity’ foundation, registered in 2015, she has invested heavily by driving private partnership to support her quest in the improvement of children’s welfare and education. Due to her special interest in the visually impaired and disabled children, she created an E-centre in Tudun Malik Special School in Kano, to reorientiate and sharpen their ambition, using modern text to speech technology to aid swift learning. The first class graduate of American University of Nigeria, Yola, is also at the forefront of educating the girl child, using her book drive platform to improve reading culture among younger generation. She is currently working assiduously to partner with foreign non-governmental groups, who will invest in provision of basic amenities that will favour the downtrodden, most especially children education, youth and women empowerment.
