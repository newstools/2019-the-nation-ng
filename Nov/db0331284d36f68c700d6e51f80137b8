 A YOUNG man Adam Kunle, 27, of Makogi area of Ibafo, Ogun State, has shed some light on why he allegedly sneaked into the home of a 38-year-old woman at noon andÂ  raped her while she was observing siesta. Kunle, who lived in the same neighbourhood with the victim, said he admired the woman and had been making advances to her for quite some time without success as she kept rejecting his offer. He added that as the undying admiration persisted, he took advantage of the lady when she was alone at home on Monday, November 4, and had his way with her sexually. The suspect made this known to the police during interrogation when he was arrested last Monday following complaints by the victim, who reported the incident at the Ibafo Police Station. The woman told police that she was raped by the suspect while sleeping in her room at about 12:30 pm. Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a release, stated that the Divisional Crime Officer, Ibafo Police Station, Akindele Andrew led detectives to arrest the suspect, stressing that the victim had been taken to the hospital for medical attention and report.
