Fondly called November, Adebukonla Kukoyi, a Lagos-based gospel music artiste, has recently released her official debut single titled ‘Don’t Pass Me By.’ November is also a saxophonist gradually creating a niche for herself in the jazz genre. Though unusual that she bears November, it becomes less mysterious as she was born in the month of November, precisely November 28. The affinity for the month translates into adopting it as her pet name.  She joined the church choir by the age of 10. She creates music that will appeal to ‘Core Christians’ and the general public as a whole. After all, Jesus didn’t come for the saved but the unsaved. In the not-so-distant future, November hopes to become a household name, inspiring people across the world to live their best lives, trust God freely and be who they truly were created to be.
