President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday ordered security agencies to “use all legal means” to stop the snatching of ballot boxes by anyone in Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa and Kogi states. The President also called for fairness and transparency in the conduct of the polls. According to him, voters should be left to decide who takes charge of the administration in the next four years. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, noted that since the ban on campaign was lifted a few weeks ago, citizens had been called to attend political rallies and were bombarded with advertising on bill boards, radio and TV; texts, tweets, WhatsApp and Facebook posts in campaigns “that sadly, have so far recorded not a few uninspiring incidents of violence and of intemperate use of language.” President Buhari made a strong demand for exemplary non-partisan conduct on electoral and law enforcement officials. He said all must carry out their functions with fairness and transparency; without let or hindrance. President Buhari added: “I call on voters in Bayelsa and Kogi states to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner and in line with the law in all situations. Law enforcement officials must ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation and any attempt to steal or hijack ballots must be stopped, using all legal means. “In all democratic elections, there are bound to be winners and losers and the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi will not be different. All candidates should be ready to accept the outcomes and wherever they are dissatisfied, they should follow the due process of the law in seeking redress. There must not be a resort to self-help.” The President wished the two states and their people safe and credible exercises “as they vote in these historic and suspenseful elections.”
