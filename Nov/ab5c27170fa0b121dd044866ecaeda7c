He noted that the state is blessed with abundant solid mineral resources, arable land for agriculture and quality human power, adding that all will be harnessed to create prosperity for the people. To this end, Wada said that he will initiate discussions with foreign and local investors, on how some of the mineral deposits can be explored to create jobs and wealth for the people of the state.

He stated that he will embark on massive infrastructural development across the state and develop the education sector from primary, secondary to tertiary levels, to give the state a better future. According to him, his administration will also look into the possibility of upgrading the College of Agriculture to a full-fledged university. He frowned at the deplorable state of Kabba township roads, saying that he will repair them alongside others in major towns in Okunland, if elected.
