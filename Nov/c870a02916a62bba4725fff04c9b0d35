REIGNING African Champions, Nigeria will face world number one, USA, Serbia and Mozambique in the battle for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. This was revealed at a brief ceremony held in Switzerland yesterday to begin the Olympics Tournament qualification race. D’Tigress will play in Belgrade after being drawn in Group A. Reacting to the draw, the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) President, Engr Musa Kida said qualification for the 2020 Olympics is possible despite admitting that it was a difficult draw. “Being drawn against world number one (USA) and seven (Serbia) surely will not make the job easy but I am optimistic that qualification for the Olympics is possible. “The men have already qualified and all eyes are on our women to also join their counterpart in Tokyo. D’Tigress are the reigning African Champions and we hope this will count when they start the qualifiers.” Kida stressed the need for early preparation for the team if they are to stand a chance in the group. “We know that tournament of this magnitude costs money, time and proper planning. We are going to be working with the Ministry of Sports to ensure that the D’tigress return to the Olympic Games.”
