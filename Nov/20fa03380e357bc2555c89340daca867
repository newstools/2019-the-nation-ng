 THE Lagos State Government has warned traders and residents in the State to desist from storing combustible materials in their homes and shops to prevent fire outbreak that may lead to loss of lives and properties. Director General / Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, (LASEMA), Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, made the warning in Lagos on Thursday following the fire outbreaks that gutted a six-storey building at 43 Martins Street and a three-storey commercial building of lock-up shops at Dosunmo market on Tuesday, around 10:00am, where goods worth millions of Naira were destroyed. He noted that the fire which continued burning non-stop for about 24hours despite all efforts to put it out by the LASEMA Response Team, Lagos State Fire Service, UBA Fire crew, Federal Fire crew, Union Bank Skylift Fire Truck and other Emergency responders, was as a result of the combustible materials stored in the buildings which kept re-igniting the fire. According to him, incident of fire outbreak is on the high side due to the inability of property and shop ownerss to put necessary precautionary measures in place to avoid incidents that could have disastrous consequences. He appealed that storage of highly inflammable materials including petrol, diesel and kerosene should be avoided, while desisting from storing combustible materials at home or shops. He sought the support of Lagos residents, especially shop owners for adequate protection of lives and properties, warning that everyone should desist from storing generators in their penthouses or roof tops as well as combustible materials in their various shops.
