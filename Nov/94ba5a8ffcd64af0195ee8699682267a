Onimisi Alao, Yola  A tipper has crashed into eight commercial motorcycles in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, causing injuries to eight people. The state Police Command gave that account of the story in a statement Wednesday morning after the incident occurred Tuesday evening and promoted wild verbal speculations of deaths. A version of the incident said the tipper lost control as it was fleeing policemen demanding bribe, and the other said it was rushing off to avoid arrest because it was carrying contraband rice. The incident clearly caused much traffic inconvenience on the usually busy Jimeta or Veniklang Bridge, more commonly called Hayin Gada, but mention of two to 20 deaths appeared to be just speculations. In its own version of the incident in a text message to our correspondent on Wednesday morning, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said, “On 12/11/2019; one Abubakar Ahmed, a rider of tricycle Reg No JAD 051 VV, along Veniklang Bridge, had a self accident as a result of tyre burst. “When policemen from Central Motor Traffic Division visited the scene to render the victims first aid and clear the road of obstruction, hoodlums attacked the police patrol vehicle, which resulted into traffic congestion. “There and then, a tipper with reg no KTG 12 XA, driven by one Musa Mohammed, lost break and hit eight tricycles where eight persons sustained injuries.” He added that the injured had been taken to hospital and that the police command was able to bring the situation under control.
