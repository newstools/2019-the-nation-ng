The week-long festival celebrates the diversity of African films, including documentaries and short films while connecting various stakeholders within the African film industry through a cinematic experience. “Apart from serving as a platform to share the African culture with the world, the industry has launched a value chain for writers, cinematographers, actors, producers, while also contributing to the economy, creating employment opportunities, and promoting investment,” he said. According to him, “Through AFRIFF, Access Bank is proud to support millions of creatives in the industry towards achieving their goals while providing economic benefit to them and many others across the world.’ Access Bank has consistently supported the Africa International Film Festival, and the partnership with AFRIFF is built on the bank’s commitment to promoting genuine African stories and also creating a platform for film makers to connect, learn, and showcase their projects. The bank’s partnership with the festival also builds on its mission to promote sustainability, deliver long-term prosperity to Nigerians, and boost the creative economy through initiatives such as ART X Lagos and the Accelerate Filmmaker Project.
