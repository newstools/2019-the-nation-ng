Two robbery suspects were reportedly burnt to death, Sunday afternoon, near Ovwian Secondary School, Ovwian, in Udu council area of Delta State. The suspects allegedly robbed an unidentified woman of her mobile phone and an unspecified sum of money along the school route. It was learnt that the incident which occurred at 1pm on Sunday attracted passersby, who responded to the screams of the woman and chased the hoodlums. On capturing them, the irate mob beat up the duo and afterwards set them ablaze. An eyewitness, who gave his name simply as Jacob, disclosed that the suspected thieves attacked the woman, took her mobile phone and some cash and fled. ”It was her screams that alerted the mob. Road users and motorcyclists who happened on the scene then joined the angry mob to run after the thieves and then set them ablaze.” A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, ”though it is sad, the way they killed the thieves, but let it serve as a lesson to others who have the mind of robbing people of their phones and other criminal related activities”.
