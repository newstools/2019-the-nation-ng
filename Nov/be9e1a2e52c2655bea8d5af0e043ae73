Bola Olajuwon  If Britain is looking beyond the European Union (EU) after January 31, 2020, it will find a credible resource rich and talent-endowed partner in Nigeria, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, has said. He stated this at the inauguration of the Group Managing Director of Greenwich Trust Limited, Mr. Kayode Folowo, as the 16th President of the Nigeria British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) Friday night in Lagos. The event was attended by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Lola Akande, Deputy British High Commissioner in Lagos, Harriet Thompson, President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Bisi Egbeyemi, Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, Chairman of S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell, who was the guest speaker, former ministers, Central Bank deputy governors and captains of industry. The minister said Nigeria was very well-positioned as a partner of choice for the British Government in Africa and the Federal Government’s plan of an economy beyond oil agreed with the major set-pieces of a British economy beyond Brexit. Falowo said his tenure would focus on a 12-agenda, which include promoting the chamber as a premium chamber, attracting more British investment to Nigeria and completing the NBCC Plaza, which is under construction. Thompson and Sorrell, who said they were optimistic about the future of Nigeria, said the relationship between the UK and Nigeria was “incredibly long”. The envoy said Britain is helping Nigeria to tackle the problems in the Northeast, strengthening security, developing education, among others.
