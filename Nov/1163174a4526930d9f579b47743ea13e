NIGERIA can now heave a sigh of relief as the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has confirmed the receipt of the balance of the overpayment made to the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) in 2017. The non-payment of the full repayment sparked a long-running saga in AFN. IAAF confirmed at the weekend that the world athletics body has received $65,000 which was the outstanding after 50 percent of the $130,000 was paid by former Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalung. Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, had approved the refund to the IAAF and the money eventually arrived in the banking account of the worldwide organization after a short delay. The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) owed the IAAF a total of $130,000. The IAAF had erroneously paid the AFN $150,000 (£117,000/€136,000), instead of the annual grant of $15,000 (£11,700/€13,400) it gives to its Member Federations. The remaining balance has proved a bone of contention between the IAAF and authorities in Nigeria, who had made several promises to repay it.
