 By Stephen Adigwu THE International School, University of Lagos Principal M.B Malik has yet said that school sports are a necessity to the development of sports in the country. This much he said at the International School, University of Lagos 30th annual inter house athletic competition held at the school’s sports centre in Lagos. “Annual inter house athletic competitions like this are done to showcase the sporting talents in the students,” Malik told NationSport. “Any school that doesn’t promote the sporting activities in a student will not get the best from them.” He also went further in encouraging the government and cooperate bodies in catching talents at a younger age, also to set up programs that will motivate the youths in focusing on their dreams. “Let’s get scouts to send to schools that are having competition like this, make them go round, work with the school coaches and sports units and identify talents, from there let them develop programs to work on them. School sports are very vital to the development of sports in the country.
