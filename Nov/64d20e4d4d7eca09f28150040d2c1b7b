Anthony Joshua has had his first look at the 16,000-seater purpose-built arena in Saudi Arabia which will host his world title rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. Joshua’s clash with Ruiz Jr will be for the WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles he lost to the Mexican back in June at Madison Square Garden. Ruiz Jr knocked Joshua down on four occasions en route to a seventh-round TKO in New York in one of the biggest shocks in boxing history. But in less two weeks on the outskirts of Saudi’s capital Riyadh, Joshua will attempt to win his belts back. Ruiz Jr headed out to the Middle East earlier this week to begin final preparations for the huge heavyweight clash. And earlier on Sunday, AJ arrived and immediately visited the arena which will hold 16,000 fans on December 7. Eddie Hearn tweeted: “AJ touches down in Saudi! @diriyahseason @skysportsboxing @dazn_usa”, alongside a video of Joshua overlooking the stadium. Joshua said earlier this week on his preparations: “We haven’t done anything differently mentally, I am a champion. I walked into the gym and three years later I was Olympic champion. “I have had one loss but I am not about to become a p*ssy overnight and not be able to fight. “I can fight, that is it, and I don’t need to reflect on that, I just need to win.”
