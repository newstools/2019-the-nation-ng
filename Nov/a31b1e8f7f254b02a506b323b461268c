The fourth edition of the ReadySetWork (RSW) initiative of the Lagos State Government kicked off last Saturday with strict warning to the participants to adhere to the rules of the employability training programme or get disqualified. The programme which would continue for the next 12 Saturdays (with six weeks of face-to-face sessions and six weeks online sessions) flagged off on the campuses of the Lagos State University (LASU) Ojo, and the Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Ikorodu. The students were advised to play by the set of rules tagged “The Rule of Seven” meant to guide the overall conduct of the participants throughout the period of the RSW.  Addressing the students in LASU, Consultant to the State Government on RSW, Sade Oshun, encouraged the students to be punctual as lateness would reduce their chance of graduating at the end of the programme. “Part of the cardinal message be championed by the RSW is punctuality and discipline. Each session starts by 7:15am every Saturday and ends by 5pm.  Anyone that comes in later than 7:15am or leaves earlier than 5pm stands the chance of forfeiting his/her participation in this programme,” she said.
