The Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has described a judgment disqualifying its Deputy Governorship Candidate for Saturday’s election, Senator Biabarakuma Degi as dead on arrival. The Publicity Secretary of the Party, Doifie Buokoribo said: “The judgement occasioned a miscarriage of justice, is glaringly perverse and against the weight of evidence before the Court. “We are totally surprised that the Court could despite the objections by our lawyers, go ahead to determine a weighty criminal allegation of falsification and fraud solely on the bases of affidavit evidence contrary to well established judicial precedents that such must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by calling oral evidence. “We strongly believe that the judgment can not withstand a superior judicial scrutiny, therefore, our lawyers have filed a notice of appeal and other court processes to arrest the execution of the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal. “We call on all our members and supporters not to be distracted but continue to peacefully mobilize for the  November 16, 2019 elections”
