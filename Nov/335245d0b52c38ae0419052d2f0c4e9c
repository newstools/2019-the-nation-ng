 After four days of action that witnessed large turnout of players across Lagos State, the 51st edition of the annual Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup will end today at the Teslim Balogun Stadium. 365 players took part in 24 events with the junior boys’ category having the largest number of participants. The venue is now wearing a new look with top dignitaries expected to grace the final. According to the referee of the tournament, John Peters, this year witnessed an improvement from previous editions as more players across Lagos continue to identify with the championship. “I must commend the family of the late Okoya-Thomas for not allowing the standard of the tournament to nose dive despite the demise of the initiator. They have maintained the quality and we can see from the interest the tournament has continued to generate among the players and fans. “Also, I am sure that some of the players competing are aware of what the tournament has done in the lives of so many top players in Nigeria. They are also looking forward to use the tournament to become world beaters,” the experienced umpire said. In the quarterfinal tie played yesterday Joseph Osendukwu was beaten by defending champion, David Fayele 4-1. Three finals will hold with the women and men singles final, the major attraction.
