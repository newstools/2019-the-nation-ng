A man has been arrested for allegedly digging up his parents’ bodies so he can exchange their bones for a motorbike. Police in Mozambique, Africa have detained a man in the northern Nampula province on suspicion of exhuming the bodies of his parents and an uncle. The man is reported to have removed their bones in one night after a businessman promised him a motorcycle and more than $300 (£234) in cash. He told the BBC: ‘The boss told me to look for bones from people who died without getting sick. In exchange, you will get a motorbike. ‘I went to a family cemetery, dug up the bones from my father’s, my mother’s and my uncle’s graves.’ The man is reported to have travelled to meet the businessman, who is involved in the exploration of mineral resources, but he was not there. A police spokesman said the incident was the fifth such case in the area this year, with most believed linked to witchcraft. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
