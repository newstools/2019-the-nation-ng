 THIS health project is a laudable one, there is no health centre here in Okun-Ajah community but this free health programme is of great importance to us because we are all benefitting from it including our husband and our children. We also benefitted from this project last year.” These were the words of one of the beneficiaries of the free annual health outreach organised by the Committee of Friends for Humanity (COFFHA), Mrs Rose Gbenga, for residents of Okun-Ajah situated at Eti-Osa local government area. Another beneficiary, who is also a widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Adeogo, could not hide her excitement. Her words: “I’ve been suffering from different ailments but no money to go to the hospital, but my attending this programme, doctor attended to me and they gave me free drugs.” No fewer than 3,000 men, women and children benefited from the free health campaign organised for Okun-Ajah community, situated opposite Laguna beach, off Abraham Adesanya Housing Estate, Ajah, Lekki, which was held recently by COFFHA. Speaking at the annual health outreach/ground breaking of the Vocational Training Centre, held in Okun-Ajah community, the president, COFFHA, Mrs. Carol Ufere, said it was a way of giving back to the society. “Our project is skill acquisition centre, we don’t just want to give people fish but also teach them how to fish; to teach them different skills so that they can have sustained means of livelihood, give them starter packs as well as monitor them because a whole lot of them divert the money to other things. But this will not happen in our own case. We also know that when they acquire skill it remains with them for life. Speaking on how COFFHA is getting funds to implement its project, Augustina Igbokwe said “We do task ourselves individually to implement these projects since we can’t go to people’s home to wipe their tears, then we decided to conceive a project where we can bring these people together and empower in all areas. That is what gave birth to these centre and our patrons and matrons and donors can see what we are using their money to do to mentor people and give back to the society. It’s a skill acquisition centre where we can empower the indigent all round and they can take care of their families.” Present to do the ground breaking ceremony, were the former Nigeria Ports Authority boss, Bayo Sarumi, Secretary General, Abuja MOU/ Ports State Control, Mrs. Mfon Usoro, Princess Vicky Haastrup, Mr. Patrick Okonjo, among others.
