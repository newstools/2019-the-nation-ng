 Nojeem Maiyegun, the first Nigerian to win an Olympic Medal will be honoured at the 24th Edition of the Karis Award that will hold on Sunday 15th December 2019 in the main auditorium of the Household of God Church at Ikeja. The Karis Award was introduced by Rev Chris Okotie of the Household of God Church in 1996, in line with his philosophy that “greatness does not consist in being great, but in the ability to make others great” The award recognises and gives cash reward to a Nigerian who must have distinguished himself/herself through his/her contribution to the development of the country in one area or the other, but his/her contribution has not been adequately recognised. Maiyegun, won a bronze medal in the lightweight division of the boxing event at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He also won a bronze medal two years later at the Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. The Karis Award is borne out of patriotism and the need to foster national unity and zeal, but it is without any religious, political, tribal, or social bias. It is a social/charity event to celebrate God’s grace, encourage patriotism and support the needy and the poor. Meanwhile,  Hogan Bassey; and Emmanuel Okala were the first two sporting legend to win the award.
