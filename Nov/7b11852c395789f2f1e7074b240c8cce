THE Group Managing Director, Nestoil Group, Dr Ernest Azudialu-Obiejesi, has unveiled the company’s new corporate identity, which includes a new logo and tag line – ‘delivering exceptional value.’ The event, held at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, was witnessed by former governor of Anambra State and Vice Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi; the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi; His Royal Majesty, Emeka Okezie, Oka Ije II of Okija and several other personalities. The GMD, in a speech entitled ‘The Beginning – An Unlikely Vision’ described the making of Nestoil as “the story of impossibility made possible,” buttressing his statement with Napoleon Hill’s famous quote: ‘Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve’. According to him, the company held tenaciously to the grand vision of building a world-class business that is rooted in innovation and leadership against all odds. The birthing of Nestoil, he said, did not fit into “the grand nature of what it is today.”
