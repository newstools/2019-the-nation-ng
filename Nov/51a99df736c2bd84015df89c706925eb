Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday granted N50 million bail to the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of 606 Authors Limited, Sarumi Babafemi. The defendant is facing a N206 million money laundering charge. Babafemi, popularly called ‘606’, is suspected of being an agent to some of the 77 Nigerians indicted for cybercrime in the United States (U.S.A), following a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operation. He was remanded last Friday by Justice Chukwujeku Aneke after he and his firms – 606 Autos Limited; 606 Music Limited and Splash Off Entertainment Limited – pleaded not guilty to a five-count charge of money laundering preferred against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). His counsel, Dr Muiz Banire (SAN), applied for his bail. Delivering ruling on the bail application yesterday, Justice Aneke admitted Babafemi to bail for N50 million with one surety in like sum, among other terms. The judge adjourned till January 22 and 23, for trial. According to the EFCC, the defendant laundered N207.1 million between 2013 and 2018. He allegedly transferred N37.6 million to Omojadesola Allison; N93 million to Olanrewaju Oriyomi; N1.5 million to Abiola Ayorinde (aka ABK); N25 million to Bartholomew Ezeudoka and N50 million to Amobi Uchenna. The commission said 6O6 “ought to have reasonably known that such funds form part of an unlawful act, to wit: obtaining money by false pretence”. EFCC lawyer A. B. C. Ozioko said 606 and his companies acted contrary to Section 15(2)(b) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended) and were liable to be punished under Section 15(3) of the same Act.
