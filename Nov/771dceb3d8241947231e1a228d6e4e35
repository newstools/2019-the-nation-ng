By Sampson Unamka An Associate Professor, Counseling Psychology, University of Lagos, Dr. Bola Makinde on behalf of Association of Professional Counsellors in Nigeria (APROCON), has appealed to the government to  focus more on counselors in universities across the country for the benefit of the society. Makinde who is also APROCON Lagos State chair, spoke  during the ‘First Lagos APROCON conference held at the University of Lagos. She said: “We want government to recognise the beauty of counselors in Nigeria and Lagos State so that these children who are drinking sniper and mixing gum and spirit inside sprite will stop.  They would have somebody to talk and open their mind to, and everybody will be happy,” said Makinde. She added that: “Today we have lead paper presentation, eminent professors talking about security and psychosocial wellness because the country is upside down. Many people are lonely and unhappy, they need counseling.We want government to recognise counselors the way it recognises scientists.In fact, science teachers are given extra allowances and we are not even talking about that, we are talking about wellness. With the theme: Counseling for Security and Psycho-Social Wellness, Makinde decried the poor attitude of parents who neglect their wards. “Parents have failed; they do not have time for their children, they are looking for money. Some parents leave home by 5am, they come back by 10pm, nobody to guide their children and their diet is not balanced. “We know there is no money in town, yet you can manage very little and make the children happy even with our local food,” she said. Wife of the Lagos State  Governor, Dr Ibironke Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by Mrs Nike Osha  praised the association, adding that their importance cannot be overemphasised. She said the youths were facing many distractions in the society while  urging them to be professional in what they do.
