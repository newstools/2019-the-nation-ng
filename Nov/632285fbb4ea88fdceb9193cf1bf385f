Oba Idowu Oniru couldn’t have asked for more things of life before he went to meet his ancestors. He lived nothing but a fulfilled life. But there was one a thing the late king couldn’t stop talking about when he was alive. His close friend and brother, Oba Tijani Akinloye, the Oba Ajiranland, opened up that the late Oba never came to terms with his brother, Alaba’s death. He stated: “My brother never came to terms with the death of his only brother. He grieved about him every day and believed he should have gone, instead of Alaba. I will surely miss my brother, Oba Abiodun Oniru. ” Oba Akinloye and Oba Oniru had been friends even before he became king. Although the latter was older, they were cousins and their grandparents were friends.
