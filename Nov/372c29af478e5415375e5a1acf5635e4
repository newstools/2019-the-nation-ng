 WHEN the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, announced Ndudi  Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House instead of the preferred candidate of the main opposition  party, Kinsley Chinda, many knew it was only a short time before the bubble burst. Elumelu, representing Aniocha North/Aniocha South and Oshimili federal constituency of Delta State, was chosen by many PDP lawmakers and other minority parties as their leader as against Chinda representing Obio Akpor federal constituency in Rivers State. The letter from the minority caucus appointing Elumelu as their leader was reportedly signed by 99 out of the 146 lawmakers that made up the minority group in the house. Others in the Elumelu-led leadership of the minority caucus include Toby Okechukwu (Enugu) as deputy minority leader, Gideon Gwani (Kaduna), as minority whip and Adesegun  Adekoya (Ogun) as deputy minority whip, while the Chinda-led faction has Chukwuma Onyema (Anambra) as deputy minority leader, Yakubu Barde (Kaduna) as minority whip and Muraina Ajibola(Oyo) as deputy minority whip. The Speaker’s announcement of Elumelu did not go down well with the national leadership of the PDP who made move to ensure that its wish was implemented by the leadership of the house. The party’s BOT set up a high powered committee to resolve the issue. But the party has insisted that Elumelu and his team should step down from the position, but other parties have also insisted that the PDP cannot dictate to them who should lead them as they should have been consulted by the party before arriving at its choice. Also, some stakeholders of the party have also argued that since the national chairman of the party is from Rivers State, it will be unfair to have the leader of the party in the House of Representatives coming from the same state. Chinda and his team have not yielded ground and appear not ready to yield ground anytime soon. In recent times, especially since the house resumed after its annual vacation, they have issued series of public statements describing themselves as the leaders of the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives. Although they appeared to have played safe by not ascribing the title of house minority leaders to themselves, they have no doubt incurred the wrath of some of their members and probably, the leadership of the house. At its seating on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 the house decided that it was time to put the dissidents in their place and directed its Committee on Ethics and Privileges led by Kolawole Lawal (APM, Ogun) to investigate the allegation against the four members and report back to the house for further action. Coming under matters of urgent national importance, Ben Igbakpa (PDP, Delta) drew the attention of the lawmakers and the leadership of the house to the activities of the Chinda-led group. Igbakpa said the Chinda-led group has been issuing public statements outside the nomenclature of this house; misleading the general public and causing confusion and disaffection in the House of Representatives. He argued that their action is “a gross abuse of the collective and individual privileges of members of house and violates Section 24, Legislative Houses (Powers and Privileges) Act, Cap L.12, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 as well extant provisions of the Standing Orders of this House.” He said “Section 60, Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1-999 (As Amended) provides that the House of Representatives shall have powers to regulate its own procedure. This is supported by Order 1 (1) 8. (2) of the Standing Orders of this House. It is common knowledge that on July 3, 2019, the Honourable Speaker, in line with Order 7 Rule 8 of the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives (which empowers the minority parties to nominate their leaders), announced the Minority Leaders of the House. This was consequently published in the Votes and Proceedings of the some date. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, some members of this House, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, Hon. Chukwuma Onyema, Hon. Umar Barde and Hon. Muraina Ajibola parading themselves as PDP Caucus Leader, Deputy Caucus Leader, Minority Whip and Deputy Minority Whip have been issuing public statements outside the nomenclature of this House; misleading the general public and causing confusion and disaffection in the House of Representatives. This is a gross abuse of our collective and individual privileges. This violates Section 24, Legislative Houses (Powers and Privileges) Act, Cap L.12, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 as well extant provisions of the Standing Orders of this House. I hereby call on this House to investigate this and bring the perpetrators to book.” Without subjecting the motion to debate, deputy speaker, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, who presided over the day’s proceedings, referred the matter to the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges to investigate and report back to the house. However, Chinda does not believe that they have done anything wrong to warrant an investigation or possible punishment. Reacting to the motion to investigate them, he claimed to have the authority of his party to act as the leader of the PDP caucus in the house, adding that other minority parties have a right to form their own caucus. He said, “I am the PDP caucus leader in the house with the authority and consent of the party. PDP is a registered political party and a creation of law and not the rules of the house. PDP has its leaders in units, communities, amongst students, traders, professionals and parliamentarians. These leaders are recognised by the party as such. I have the mandate of the PDP to act as its leader in the house. Other minority parties are free to have their caucus leadership. I don’t see how that offends ad rule or law of the house or the constitution.” The Nation gathered that the committee that was set up by the BOT to investigate Elumelu and his group exonerated them from any complicity in the nomination and announcement of the minority leadership of the house. The committee was said to have advised the National Working Committee of the party to work with the minority leadership of the house in the interest of a united and stronger PDP in the national assembly. It also asked the minority caucus in the house to always carry along members of the caucus and the leadership party in line with its statutory rules and tenets of democracy. The committee which was led by former Senate President, Iyorcha Ayu, had as members prominent leaders of the party who have served as lawmakers and presiding officers of the national assembly at one time or the other. They are Adolphus Wabara and David Mark who also served as senate presidents, Ibrahim Mantu and Austin Opara who served as deputy senate president and deputy speaker respectively. One of the national leaders of the party, Chief Edwin Clark, also asked the party to accept Elumelu and his party, work with them and face other national issues by playing its role as the main opposition party in the country. Recent developments are suggestive of the fact that about five months after the issue, the party was yet to accept Elumelu and his team as the leaders of the party in the House of Representatives. The question on the minds of assembly watchers especially those knowledgeable on the workings of the legislature is whether Chinda and his group will buckle and accept their faith and whether the house will leave them to carry on their activities which some members view as an affront on the house leadership. In the eighth Senate, Senator Ali Ndume was announced as senate leader by the then senate president, Bukola Saraki, as against Senator Ahmed Lawan who was the choice of the party. Lawan accepted his faith and played along until Ndume fell out with the senate leadership and was removed and suspended. That paved the way for Lawan who is the current senate president to assume duty as the senate leader and leader of the APC caucus in the senate. There are, however, those who believe that the ongoing power tussle may be a carry over a carryover of the feud between the Governor Nyesom Wike group that supported Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal during the party’s presidential primary in Port Harcourt and the others that supported former vice president, Atiku Abubakar. Even though Atiku won the primary and eventually flew the party, the Wike group has held on to their guns and have refused to accept Elumelu as the leader of the party in the green chambers. On the other hand, Elumelu is believed to be an unrepentant supporter of the former vice president. Some party members believe that Wike and his group may actually be the power behind the opposition to Elumelu’s election as the minority leader. The Rivers governor has been the major advocate for Chinda to assume the role of minority leader. Giving credence to the allegation that the Chinda group are causing confusion in the house is the fact that both the Elumelu and Chinda groups have been issuing separate statements on some national issues. One of such is the statement they both issued regarding the impeachment of Achuba as deputy governor of Kogi State. The statement by the Chinda group asked Nigerians to condemn the purported impeachment carried out by members of the Kogi State House of Assembly in concert with the state government. It stated that the purported impeachment of Mr. Simon Achuba was, to say the least, offensive, grotesque and embarrassing as the entire process was a hoax. Elumelu’s group in its own statement on behalf of the “caucus” also condemned Achuba’s impeachment and his replacement with Edward Onoja, describing the action as “overt lawlessness unknown to the laws of the land.” It warned that the people of Kogi should brace up to a “more oppressive and rapacious mode of governance if Governor Bello and the APC were allowed to force a minority government on the people once again.” The statement said: “Our understanding of that government in Lugard House is that of one given to an unabashed, unrepentant, and a rapacious breach of the people’s will.  The so-called removal of the deputy governor is the height of unhinged travesty. It is impunity taken too far. It is neither known to the law, nor the Constitution of Nigeria and cannot be allowed to stand. By the purported removal of the deputy governor despite a ‘not guilty’ verdict returned by the impeachment panel, it is self-evident that these people are no respecters of the law. The travesty is of no consequence for it imposes a defacto and not a dejure deputy on the people of Kogi State and can only be short-lived. The good news is that the blundering government will soon have its day in the court of public opinion on November 16 and we trust the people of Kogi to pass an overwhelming vote of no confidence in the government and remove the incompetent and overbearing minority contraption from their Government House. For emphasis, we are by this statement placing a caveat emptor on both the Certificate of Occupancy and occupant of Lugard House. The people of Kogi should beware, for if the governor could unleash this magnitude of abuse of power, hunger, and impunity in his first term, knowing he would face the people at the polls, how much more high-handed and vicious would he get in his second term?” The caucus, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop the reckless abuse of power in the state as democracy can only survive by the sanctity of the rule of law. So, the claims and counter-claims by the two groups is another pointer to the division among the PDP in the House of Representatives to which the party has allegedly turned a blind eye. Although there were denials about having a faction, everything has indicated otherwise as the groups go in separate directions. What is, however, believed by many observers is that while the leadership of the House of Representatives recognises the Ndudi Elumelu as the minority leader, other forces within the PDP are supporting another group to claim the position through the backdoor. Asked to comment on who actually is the leader of the PDP caucus in the house recently, Elumelu said he will not make any comment on it since the matter has been referred to the Ethics and Privileges Committee by the house. He said whatever he says may affect the outcome of investigation either positively or negatively. He said, “Wait till the outcome of the investigation which is ongoing. At the end, you will get first hand information on the situation of things”. However, it was discovered that rather than maintain status quo ending the outcome of investigation, the two factional leaders have continued to make public statement, one as house minority leaders and the other as PDP caucus leaders. It is not clear, however, whether the house has provision for such in the rules.
