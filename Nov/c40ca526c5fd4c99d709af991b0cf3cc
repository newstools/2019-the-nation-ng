Osagie Otabor, Benin There was heavy security at the secretariat of the Edo All Progressives Congress(APC) following it rumoured forceful take over by the faction loyal to National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. At the Edo House of Assembly, heavy security presence was also noticed. Some suspected thugs were seen around the Assembly complex. A member of the Edo APC executive, who pleaded anonymity, said the security measures were to prevent destruction of the party’s properties. He said the acting State Chairman would be heavily resisted from entering the secretariat. “You know the EPM members brought thugs into the state to foment trouble. They want to take over the secretariat to prove to their sponsors they are on ground,” he said. A source at the Edo Assembly said the heavy security was because of talks that the 14 lawmakers that have been holed up in Abuja planned to storm the complex. When contacted for comments, Speaker Frank Okiye said the security was because Governor Obaseki was to present the 2020 budget. On planned by the 14 lawmakers to storm the Assembly, the Speaker queried whether they were coming for inauguration. “Except they are coming as spectators, today is not slated for inauguration. You know as the Governor is coming, there will be more security.”
