The lawmaker representing Badagry Federal Constituency, Babatunde Hunpe, has decried the seizure of coconut and harassment of traders by Customs. Coconut traders in Badagry on October 27 protested the seizure of 1, 450 bags of locally-sourced coconuts by  Customs on Agbara Road, Lagos. The traders, under the auspices of Lagos State Coconut Sellers and Traders Association (LASCOSTRAS), marched to the palace of Akran of Badagry and Badagry Local Government secretariat at Ajara. LASCOSTRAS General Secretary Tunde Hunpatin,  spokesman for the traders, said the protest was to express their displeasure on the seizure and harassment by Customs officials. He said the indigenes were known for coconut plantation. Hunpatin said residents feed their families with proceeds from coconut sales. “We have over 100 communities in Badagry that produce coconuts and people from these areas depend on the product to feed their families and send their children and wards to schools. “Consequently, people come from different states and cities to buy coconuts at Agbalata market before taking them to destinations. “A day has been set aside for the celebration of coconuts in Badagry, when people from all walks of life come to celebrate the festival in Badagry,” he said. Hunpe said the seizure of coconuts and harassment of traders by men of the Customs was uncalled for  “now the border has been partially closed.” “It did not mean well for the growth of the market. “If you go to our coconut market in Badagry, many of the products have rot because customers are no longer coming to buy. “Customs officers should know the coconuts planted in Badagry and the ones coming from neighbouring countries,” he said. The legislator, however, praised security operatives who mounted checkpoints in the city for doing a good job by checking the influx of contraband into the country.
