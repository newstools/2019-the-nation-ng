John Ofikhenua, Abuja  The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has suspended the supply of petroleum products supply to filling stations within 20 kilometers of all boarders. This was contained in a EII/2019/circular No 027 that was dated 6th November, 2019. The Deputy Comptroller-General, Enforcement, Inspection and Investigation (EI & E.), Chidi I. issued the circulated was addressed to all Zonal Coordinators, Operation Swift Response, Sector Coordinator 1,2,3$4, Customs Area Comptrollers, Coordinators CCG Strike Force Teams, Coordinator, Hqtrs Strike Force Team, and All Marine Commands. The circular reads in part: “The Comptroller-General of Customs has directed that henceforth no petroleum product no matter the tank size is permitted to be discharged in any filling station within 20 kilometres to the border. Consequently, you are all to ensure strict compliance, please.” Asked to explain the essence of the directive on phone, the Public Relations Officer, Mr. Joseph Attah told The Nation that the whole idea is to stem the tide of smuggling of petroleum products out of Nigeria. According to him, the NCS has realized that the partial closure of the borders in August, some petrol stations have been springing up almost at the border lines with the sole purpose of smuggling petrol products out of the country. He added that “the circular is, therefore, instructing us (NCS) to stop that. And ours is to enforce government’s directive.”
