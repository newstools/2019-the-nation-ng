After fresh information emerged on the celebrated case of the killing of women in hotels in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, recently, a high court sitting in the state on Monday ordered the police to produce one Nemi ThankGod for prosecution at the next adjourned sitting. Prosecution led by the Attorney-General (A-G) and Commissioner of Justice, in the state, Professor Zaccheus Adango, said ThankGod was mentioned in the police case file but was not charged to court with prime suspect Gracious David-West. He insisted that ThankGod should also be charged for prosecution. Adango applied to the court, seeking to substitute the initial 10-count charge with a fresh charge, together with proof of evidence (a document which contains all the statements made by witnesses, as well as statements made by the accused persons themselves). He sought an adjournment to enable the defence counsel study the fresh information served on him in the court, on Monday. Following this, trial judge Adolphus Enebeli upheld the prosecution’s request and ordered the police to produce ThankGod before the court. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the sitting, the A-G said, “Just last week Thursday, we got the case file from the police, which revealed criminal accusations against another accused person Nemi ThankGod. “We have prepared fresh information, along with proof of evidence as required by law, but unfortunately, the learned Justice was served this morning and we were able to serve the first accused person in the court and it is only fair that they should take time to study the case file, the information and proof of evidence, so the matter has been adjourned to November 21, 2019, for the plea. “Both David-West and Nemi ThankGod are charged as accused persons in the proceedings, the police charged only Gracious David-West, but from the case file, we discovered that a second person, ThankGod Nemi ought to have been charged, so we are charging him together with David-West, so, the two of them would take their plea on the 21st of November.”
