An acting Permanent Secretary, Benue State Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology, Mr Serker Akaa, his expectant  wife and their two children were on Monday killed in an early morning inferno which razed their home while neighbours and residents slept. The mysterious fire, according to an eyewitness, began at about 2:45am when most residents of the quarters were asleep. Neighbours said the fire  may have been caused by an electrical fault which razed three other houses including that of an aide of the state governor Daniel Unongo. The Nation learned that firefighters struggled to put out the fire which raged for a long time. The victims’ family house was recently attacked by hoodlums. Deputy Governor Benson Abounu who visited the scene of the incident expressed shock at the level of devastation, describing the incident as a monumental disaster. “It is a black day for Benue,” he said. “The state has lost a prized asset in Mr Akaa.  Government will take charge of the burial for the dead and also, assist the other families who lost property. Rev. Favour Akaa, brother to the deceased, described him as a God-fearing man who had attended two retreats at the ECWA Church in Makurdi at the weekend where he worshipped. The late acting Permanent Secretary, it was learnt, was due to be confirmed substantive Permanent Secretary before his demise.
