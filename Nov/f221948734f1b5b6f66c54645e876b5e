Eric Ikhilae Abuja A Federal High Court in Abuja has voided the candidacy of the deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16 election in Bayelsa State. Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment on Tuesday, held that Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo gave false information in his CF0001 form submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC) to contest the election. Ekwo said he found no nexus in the name on his school-leaving certificate, first degree (BA), Masterâ€™s and the affidavits he swore. The judgment was on a suit by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against the APC governorship candidate, David Lyon, Degi-Eremienyo and INEC, seeking the disqualification of Degi-Eremienyo. The judge further held that all the documents the APC deputy governorship candidate tendered documents bore different names. The judge proceeded to disqualify Degi-Eremienyo on the ground that he provided false information to the electoral umpire to stand for the election. Details shortly.
