Concerned Kwara North indigenes have described the emergence of Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq as a blessing to the district. They said he has interest in bridging the gap of underdevelopment and neglect the area has suffered for long. Spokesman for the group Musa Idris Buko said the governor’s actions showed that he was determined to correct the age-long neglect of the area. He added: “When we advocated Kwara North governorship project in 2018, we did that with a strong belief that on the tenet of equity, fairness and justice, it was our turn with the intent that that would be a means of addressing the marginalisation of the area on the indices of infrastructure and human capital development. “It is a fact that Kwara North is the most marginalised, nonetheless, there are several other sections of the state that are suffering the same fate in silence. There is a great imbalance in the distribution of opportunities, which gives overwhelming dominance to a section of the state over others. “Against this background, there is the need to have an institution of government to be saddled with the task of ensuring equal distribution of resources, projects and opportunities in conformity with the Kwara State character. This will no doubt open more opportunities for not only less privileged communities, but also ensure all-inclusiveness, as well as make our dear state convenient for all.”
