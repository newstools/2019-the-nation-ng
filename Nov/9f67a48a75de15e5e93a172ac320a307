Nigeria Under 17 coach, Manu Garba says the Golden Eaglets have perfected their plans that will see them beat European side The Netherlands today in the round of 16 at the ongoing FIFA U17 World Cup in Brazil. NationSport reports that the Golden Eaglets maintained top spot in Group B despite losing 2-1 to Australia their last game. They will now take on the Dutch team, who qualified from Group D as one of the four best third-placed teams, for a place in the last eight of the cadet championship. Garba revealed that after watching and reviewing video of their last match against the Australians, all the mistakes noticed have been corrected as he expects the striker to convert their scoring chances this time around. “In the match against Australia, though we lost, the players have been shown the video and a critical analysis was made to show them their mistakes and those mistakes were corrected both visually and on training ground. “The positive thing was we had 34 attempts and 11 were on target and have also worked on composure in front of goal and precision. The Dutch system of play is a bit similar to the Nigerian one but we will try as much as possible to very well organized and keeping good shape in defense when we are out of possession and most importantly to deny them space and time to play. “On a final note we have told the players to concentrate, be committed, confident and composed throughout the duration of the match,” said the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup winning coach.
