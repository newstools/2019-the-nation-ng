By Adesoji Adeniyi, Osogbo  There was palpable tension on Friday in Sabo area of Ile-Ife, Osun State on Friday, following an alleged killing of two persons at a mining site in Aruwa village in Atakunmosa Local Government Area of Osun State. The two labourers, one Hausa and the other Yoruba, were allegedly killed during a fracas at the mining site. An eye witness, who preferred anonymity, said: “The death of that Yoruba labourer is what is presently creating tension amongst Northerners living in Sabo area of Ile-Ife because of their experience in 2017. “Since many of those Northern labourers reside at Sabo, there is an apprehension that the Yoruba might want to revenge the death of their kinsman the way it happened then, which made those northerners to come out with weapons to defend themselves and their property.” Meanwhile, tension is building up in the Sabo area of Ife as there were sporadic gun shots that had left many business owners to hurriedly close for business. A resident however confirmed that the gunshots were from the security operatives deployed to the area. The Police Public Relations Officer for Osun Command, Mrs. Folasade Odoro, who assured that the situation was under control, said: “The Commissioner of Police has deployed men to the area to douse the tension there. So, there is no reason for people to panic.”
