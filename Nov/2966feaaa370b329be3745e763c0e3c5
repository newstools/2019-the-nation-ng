PATRICK VIEIRA is the “right man” to become Arsenal boss, according to former Gunners goalkeeper David Seaman. Arsenal are starting their search for a new manager for only the second time in 23 years after sacking Unai Emery. And ex-Gunners captain Vieira, now manager of Nice, could be a candidate. “I am sure Arsenal fans would love Patrick to come back to the club. Knowing Patrick, I think he would be the right man,” Seaman told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Football Daily Podcast. “I knew what he was like as a player. I knew what he was like as a captain. He was a born leader and everybody knows that. Maybe go down that route instead of a tried and tested route.” Freddie Ljungberg, 42, is the caretaker boss but Seaman says he hopes his former team-mate does not get the job. “This job is much bigger than what Freddie is used to at the moment,” said the ex-England international. “He has only just got into the coaching side of the game and he will be really avant-garde as a manager but while he is taking charge now, please try and get some sort of defensive formation sorted out.”
