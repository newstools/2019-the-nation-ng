When it comes to skincare, the way forward is definitely using products derived directly from nature and its endless resources. Also, while choosing a natural skin care product, it is important to remember that all these products are not created equally. In today’s skincare market we frequently come across products with labels such as “natural,” “organic” and even “chemical-free”. Lets us first understand the meaning of these terms. Natural Skincare: A natural skin care product may be defined as one made of ingredients that are by-products of a plant, mineral or animal. However, this term is often used by companies for marketing purposes because no governing authority is responsible for regulating these products. Therefore, a product containing some natural ingredients may claim to be natural, even if certain synthetic ingredients are also present in the product. Organic Skincare: This term refers to how an ingredient or ingredients used in a product were farmed. The ingredients in the best organic skincare products must be grown without using any chemical fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, or growth hormones. Organic skincare products are manufactured using plant-derived ingredients along with some other organic materials. They are not made of genetically modified ingredients and are not tested on animals. Also, these products are minimally processed and do not contains additives or petrochemicals. Mentioned below are some of the most important reasons why we should only use organic products.
