by Oladapo Sofowora  For someone like Femi Otedola to have bounced back to winning, after he was ruffled by the fall in global oil price in 2008 is enough testimony that his name “Oluwafemi” meaning “God Loves Me” answers every question about his uncommon grace. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “He who loses money, loses much. He who loses a friend, loses much more. He who loses faith, loses all.” Femi Otedola is a man who was raised to believe in his Creator just like the biblical people of Zion, when God turned around their captivity. After tenaciously trudging through that tough trial, providence granted him his heart desire by favouring him. The chairman, Geregu Power PLC had a chance to smile again, rubbing shoulders with top billionaires across the world. On Monday, November 4, Femi Otedola was gifted another birthday by God on mother earth. He received deserved felicitations from all over the world. Archetypal of his billionaire peers, who love to throw massive birthday shindig or call a gathering of praise singers to sing their praises to high heavens, Femi spent the day quietly in the company of his family for lunch at a serene highbrow restaurant in the heart of London, United Kingdom. The son of former Governor of Lagos state, quietly jetted into the country few days ago in preparation to host the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other top dignitaries at the “Gold Gala” dinner organised by his Disc Jockey daughter, DJ Cuppy at the Congress Hall Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja on Sunday, November 10.
