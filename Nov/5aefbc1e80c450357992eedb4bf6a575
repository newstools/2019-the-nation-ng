Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Tuesday said the police authorities got wind of plans by politicians to dress some of their supporters in police uniforms during last Saturday’s Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections. He also alleged that fake policemen disrupted the November 16 governorship elections in parts of the two states. He insisted that they were not part of the personnel officially deployed for election duties by the police force. Adamu briefed State House correspondents at the end of a security meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja. He said that investigation was still ongoing to identify those who caused violence during the elections. Adamu said 11 arrests had been made. According to him, all security personnel, who worked during the elections, were given “special identification tags.” He said anyone without the tag was on illegal duty. The security situation in the country, he said, remained stable. On the alleged police extortion of motorists in the Southeast by police officers at check points, he advised that people should always copy the names of such police officers and report them to the police hierarchy in the area.
