 LAGOS state government is set to register all religious bodies in the state for ease of reference, communication purposes and to enable them to participate in government programmes and activities. The government had an agreement with religious leaders on having a database of all churches and mosques located in the state at a stakeholders’ meeting with Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), at Alausa, Ikeja yesterday. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf allayed the fear of the religious leaders, assuring them that it was not for taxation purposes. A communiqué issued at the end of the meeting and read by Akinbile-Yussuf said the meeting agreed to have a database of all religious bodies in the state on a platform for ease of reference and communication purposes. She added that the Ministry of Home Affairs would collaborate with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources through Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, LASEPA, to eradicate noise pollution emanating from places of worship throughout the state. She stated that the meeting agreed that religious bodies in the state would continue to co-exist peacefully and eschew violence and acts that could lead to wanton destruction of lives and property. “The meeting has agreed that religious bodies will assist the government in community policing by monitoring, preaching, lecture and prayer against criminal acts in the state. “The Ministry of Home Affairs will embark on training and re-training of religious leaders through conferences, seminars, workshop and lectures to assure the development and inclusive governance in the state,” she said. The commissioner also charged religious leaders to come up with solutions that would help tackle the menace of hoodlums in the state.
