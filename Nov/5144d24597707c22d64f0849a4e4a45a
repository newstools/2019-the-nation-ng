Three officials of the Edo State Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have been arraigned before a Federal High Court in Benin City for allegedly tampering with 29kg of methamphetamine by removing it from lawful custody. They were said to have acted without lawful authority. Names of the officials were given as Shamsudeen  Amali 38, Muhammad Akiku Hamidu 38 and Ebadan Joseph Osemudiamen 36. They were said to have committed the offence in March 2019 and had been in the NDLEA custody without being granted administrative bail. All the suspects pleaded not guilty to the three count charges preferred against them. Counsel to the suspects, Osahenoma Greg Odaze and A.N Thomas, in their various applications urged the court to grant their clients bàil since they had been in custody for over 150 days. Odaze said the NDLEA took the case to a vacation court but failed to arraign the suspects. He said the suspects were senior officials of the NDLEA, adding that they would not jump bail. Presiding Judge, Justice Mukta Garba Umar, granted the suspects bail in the sum of N500,000 each and a surety in like sum, who must be known by the suspects.
