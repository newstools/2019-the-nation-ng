 THE Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has commenced the trial run of the newly installed Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Runway 18 Right, Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. The exercise which started  on Tuesday indicated that the equipment is fully operational on test basis, even as all the ILS components – Localizer, Glide Slope and Distance Measuring Equipment propagated signals optimally. Speaking at the commencement of the test run, Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu said the alignment of the facility had already been done by the engineers. This, according to him, was to ensure that the equipment aligned with the centre line of the runway and also that it is aligned with the descent path that will be comfortable to arrive the threshold at a good landing height to make a normal landing. “In a couple of weeks, we will bring a calibration aircraft to fly in and certify that the equipment is good to go,” he said.

Explaining the rationale for deploying the facility, Akinkuotu said the agency was responding to the demands and clamour by airlines for better navigational facilities in Nigeria. “The CAT II ILSs we have right now are 800 meters visibility. “With the CAT III system you will be able to come down lower and when you are closer to the runway you will be able to see it better. A CAT III operation is a precision approach at lower than CAT II minima. “A category III A approach is a precision instrument approach and landing with no decision height or a decision height lower than 100ft (30m) and a runway visual range not less than 700ft (200m),” Akinkuotu explained.
