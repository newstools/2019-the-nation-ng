 An Igbosere Chief Magistrate’s Court on Monday remanded two men, Chief Ona Chikweruba and Rufus Okeke in the Nigeria Correctional Services (NCS) custody for allegedly defrauding  one Celestine Odukwo of the sum of N17 million. They will remain in custody until  their bail is perfected, Chief Magistrate (Mrs) L. Y. Balogun said. The defendants were arraigned before Balogun on a two-count charge of false pretences and conspiracy by the Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (Force CIID) Annex, Alagbon, Ikoyi, Lagos. According to the legal officer of Force CIID, Alalgbon, Morufu Animashaun, the defendants allegedly committed the offence sometime in 2016, at IHS area, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos. Animashaun told the court that Chikweruba and Okeke with others now at large, with an intent to defraud, collected the sum of N17 million, from Odukwo, with the promise of supplying and selling scrap batteries and inverters to him. He said that after receiving the money from their victim, the defendants and others involved in illicit act, disappeared and could not be traced. Animashaun stated that it took the operatives of Force CIID several years before the defendants could be apprehended and brought before the court. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. Following their not guilty plea, the prosecutor urged the court to remand them till the determination of the charge and asked for a trial date. However, counsel to the defendants, D. I. Osoala and G. Ojiekhudi respectively, informed the court that they have filed bail applications for the defendants and same have been served on the prosecution.
