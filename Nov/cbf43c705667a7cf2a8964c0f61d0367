Nwanosike Onu, Awka  AHEAD of Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State, Igbo resident in the state have been urged to vote for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Yahaya Bello, describing him as a friend of Igbo. National Coordinator, South East Young Progressive Forum, Comrade Otimkpu Chizoba, in a statement yesterday in Awka, the Anambra State capital, called on all Igbo in Kogi State to come out en mass and cast their votes for Governor Bello. The SEYPF also urged Igbo resident in the state to reflect on the past and know the kind of people they had been associating with before, adding: “All that glitters is not gold.” According to the group, it is on record that security of lives and property of Igbo people living in Kogi had been well protected under the administration of Governor Bello. It said: “Our people have not had it so good. Some people and parties have been going about promising Igbo heaven on earth. “Ndigbo should ask those people and parties and their members what happened all those years when the party and some of them were in power.” The group said Governor Bello had performed well in the areas of infrastructure renewal, security, clearing of outstanding salaries of Kogi Workers and therefore deserved a second term.
