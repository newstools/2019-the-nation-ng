THE Speaker of the House of Representatives Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila has sympathized with traders and shop owners at the popular Balogun Market, Idumota, Lagos over the fire outbreak that occurred at the market on Tuesday. The Speaker said the fire incident, which affected two-storey buildings at No. 43, Martins Street, in the market where property worth millions of naira were lost, was unfortunate. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker said it was painful that traders and shop owners, who were carrying out their lawful businesses, would wake up only to face such an incident. He called on relevant authorities to take measures that would forestall the reoccurrence of such an incident. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has called for immediate investigation on the cause of fire incident that ravaged parts of the Balogun Market in Lagos State. The party, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan made the call on Thursday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan also called for investigation on what he described as “apparent system failures” that frustrated prompt intervention in such an emergency. He expressed PDP concerns about the devastating fire incident and the losses suffered by Nigerians, particularly in the face of the prevailing economic challenges. “The PDP is however more disturbed by the manifest system deficiencies that led to the failure to promptly bring the fire under control and abate the losses. “The party tasks the authorities to live up to their billing by putting in place measures that will ensure more proactive fire emergency interventions in the country,” Ologbondiyan said. He commiserated with victims of the inferno and urged the government as well as public-spirited groups and individuals to come to their aid.
