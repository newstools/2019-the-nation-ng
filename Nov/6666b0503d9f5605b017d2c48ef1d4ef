Onimisi Alao, Yola  Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri has directed that all Permanent Secretaries in Adamawa State who were not on grade level 17 before their appointments be dropped with immediate effect. The Governor also announced that government will gradually phase out office of the Deputy Permanent Secretaries in the state as the office is not enshrined in the scheme of civil service. Fintiri made the declarations in Government House Yola on Wednesday while receiving the final report of a Technical Committee for the Evaluation of the state Civil Service. The committee was constituted by the government in September to x-ray the civil service and propose changes that could advance the service and facilitate governance. Still drawing on the recommendations of the committee, Governor Fintiri declared a partial lift of embargo on employment “in the areas of need” to pave way for especially lower cadre appointments to strengthen civil service workforce. He thanked members of the committee for their effort, saying he would soon constitute a committee to bring out a white paper on the recommendations for subsequent full implementation. Earlier in his remark, he Chairman of the Technical Committee for the Evaluation of Civil Service, Mr. Benson Jailani who is a former State Head of Civil Service, said the committee had among others recommended scraping the office of Deputy Permanent Secretaries as the office is not recognized by law. Mr. Jailani said the committee observed that complete embargo on employment in the state is affecting the work of civil service and recommended a partial lift.
