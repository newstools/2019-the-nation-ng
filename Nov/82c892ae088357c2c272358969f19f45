Okiemute is set to make her maiden East African media campaign in December to promote the EP and meet her fans.  Ahead of the trip, she said: “I have so much for you, my East African family. I am looking forward to this trip so I can meet all of you and hopefully get to collaborate on a few projects with artists in the region.
