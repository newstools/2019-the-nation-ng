Whether or not the social network platforms need to be regulated is not in doubt.  What is in doubt is whether beheading is the solution to headache. This is the picture painted by the proposed National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech (Estb., etc) Bill 2019. The bill, sponsored by a former Senate spokesperson, now the Deputy Senate Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, passed first reading on the floor of the red chamber on Tuesday. It seeks the establishment of a Federal Government agency to check hate speech and prescribed death by hanging as the maximum punishment for certain categories of offenders. Other offenders are either liable to 10 years jail term, payment of N10m fine. Why Abdullahi, who had sponsored a similar bill in the 8th Senate, but it could not survive the second reading due to overwhelming opposition and criticisms exhumed the bill is something he alone can explain. The virulent criticisms that trailed the first reading of the bill in the senate were understandable. As a matter of fact, it is difficult not to see the fear of people who think the Muhammadu Buhari government is behind the proposed bill, given the president’s antecedents as a military head of state, and even now that he is president in a democratic dispensation. Even though the government has not associated with the bill, it had itself given notice of its intention to regulate the social media space. But one issue that has to be addressed is what constitutes hate speech? The fear that the Buhari government would most likely abuse executive powers if the hate speech bill becomes law would appear real. This is a man who exhibited an uncommon phobia for the traditional media in his first coming to power on December 31, 1983 via the Decree Four that he promulgated, which was for all intents and purposes a media gag law. Buhari, then a young military officer never hid his fears for the press. One nauseating aspect of Decree Four was the fact that it was not necessarily about media report being truthful. It was more of whether the report was capable of embarrassing the government of the day. At least two journalists, Messrs. Tunde Thompson and Nduka Irabor were jailed under the obnoxious, vexatious and discriminatory decree.  No one is sure whether about 35 years down the line, the man has changed significantly. Indeed, not many Nigerians will agree he has. At best, even now, Buhari can only be said to be comfortable with a press that is not totally free. Again, if, 35 years after Decree Four, a senator is now coming up with the idea of death penalty for hate speech, under the same Buhari government, then one can begin to guess where the idea could be coming from. Indeed, for me, it is a case of the voice of Senator Abdullahi but the hand of Buhari. Death penalty in the 21st Century! But we should not forget that Buhari had three Nigerians, Bernard Ogedegbe (29), Bathlomew Owoh (26) and Lawal Ojuolape (30) executed for dealing in drugs in his first coming. The case of Owoh drew global attention because at the time the offence was committed, the maximum punishment in the country’s legal code was six months imprisonment. But the Buhari government enacted Decree 20, which had a retroactive effect and carried the death penalty.  The fact of the matter is that Buhari, even though 35 years older than he was in 1984, has not changed in terms of his world outlook. His governance style has not changed significantly either. The military style in him is still very much intact. If you doubt this, how else do you explain the continued incarceration of former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd) , El-Zakzaky and now Omoyele Sowore, despite court orders that they be released? In spite of the cries by many Nigerians that the rule of law be followed, the man has remained unperturbed; it is as if nothing is happening. Even in the days of Ibrahim Babangida, they hid under the cover of ouster clauses to commit all kinds of hara-kiri. Buhari has since discovered that that was a bloody waste of time. “Let the courts say whatever they want to say, I will always do whatever I want to do. I do not have to waste government money on stationery and other materials needed to do ouster clauses,” seems Buhari’s unspoken words on these issues. As a matter of fact, as recently as 2015, Buhari still defended his actions as military head of state adding that they accepted responsibilities for the actions. No remorse, not even on the retroactive nature of the decree. As far as he was concerned, there was a big problem of drug peddling which had to be dealt with sternly and the government dealt with it that way. Now, because the president and commander-in-chief does not seem concerned about the flagrant violations of the law by the Department of State Service (DSS), the department has turned the Sowore issue into a wall clock joke by saying those who should come to pick him home have not come. They are also saying that Dasuki and El-Zakzaky feel comfortable in their custody! Hear the DSS: “”There has been outcry about alleged illegal detention of some notable persons undergoing trials at the courts and disobedience to court orders by the Service. To put the records straight, the Service wishes to avert public attention to the circumstances that warranted the custody of Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.) and Sheik Ibrahim El-Zakzaky in its facility. “For the avoidance of doubt, the duo had appealed to the courts to be left in the custody of the Service instead of being taken to the Correctional Centres. Well-meaning Nigerians are equally witnesses to the case of Omoyele Sowore, who, on a similar order of the court, was to be remanded at the Kuje or Suleja Centre, but preferred to be kept at the DSS…” The service said the three people made the choice on their own volition. It added that the three of them are being given the best services ever and that “there could not have been better treatments than these.” Now, does this not qualify for hate speech? How on earth can any sane man opt to have his freedom of movement curtailed? Is the DSS facility such a five-star hotel where people are spoilt with virtually anything they need and which money can buy? If the punishment for insult is death, what then would be the punishment for the humongous amounts of money that our lawmakers take home every month? If hate speech could lead to death, thus making it imperative for the person who commits the offence liable to death by hanging, is the consequence of the lawmakers’ pay not worse than the criminalisation of insult? When just one man goes home with millions of naira monthly in a country where minimum wage has just been pushed up to N30,000 per month (which some state governments are finding difficult to pay), is that not worse than hate speech? The billions that the lawmakers appropriate to themselves will go a long way in providing infrastructure for millions of Nigerians. When such a huge amount is frittered as it were, it denies countless people the opportunity of good schools, well-staffed and stocked hospitals, good roads, housing, etc. It denies millions of jobs, thus indirectly leading to social dislocations and death in many cases. These days, we see all manner of people committing suicide. It is the result of the frustrations that the vast majority of Nigerians are subjected to daily. Yet, the lawmakers are the very ones now making passing of insult a crime punishable by hanging. There’s God o! Now, what was it in the long months that the Federal Government looked the other way when herdsmen were killing other innocent Nigerians on their ancestral lands in the name of rearing cattle? And when it eventually found its voice, it came up with the RUGA idea? Please this senate should get more serious. There are many pressing issues to deal with than to begin dreaming of death penalty at a time the civilised world is eliminating the capital punishment from their statute books. People will not have time to engage in hate speech when they are otherwise productively engaged. It is because people don’t have jobs that the devil is keeping them busy with the social media. What has the senate done about giving Nigerians power, for example? See the state of our hospitals, our roads, our schools, etc. What do we charge those of them responsible for all these national crises with? Let the Federal Government and the senate concentrate on more serious issues. When the country normalises, far less people will not engage in hate speech. The crimes committed by many of our leaders are worse, deadlier than hate speech. Finally, Mr President, what do we charge you with for saying  “the dog and the baboon would all be soaked in blood?” Love speech? What if the law takes retroactive effect?
