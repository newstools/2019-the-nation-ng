 Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri on Tuesday directed implementation of the N30,000 national minimum wage for state and local government workers. He said the implementation is to take effect from this month. The governor gave the directive while launching the construction and rehabilitation of roads in Toungo, headquarters of Toungo Local Government. Fintiri stressed that his administration would pay the minimum wage as he promised, following conclusion of negotiations between the government and Labour union. The governor’s spokesman, Solomon Kumangar, issued a statement yesterday and passed it to reporters at the capital, Yola. The statement said: “Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has directed that payment of the new national minimum wage should commence from November 2019. This order covers state civil servants as well as local government employees.” On the rural roads project, the governor said his administration had taken holistic approach to enhance rural transformation. He said construction of roads would reduce cost of transportation in rural areas. Fintiri added that the roads would promote socio-economic activities, as the greater population was at the rural areas. He urged the contractors to ensure speedy completion of the roads as stipulated in the contractual agreement. The District Head of Toungo, Alhaji Muhammadu Jaimu, lauded the governor for constructing roads and carrying out electrification projects.
