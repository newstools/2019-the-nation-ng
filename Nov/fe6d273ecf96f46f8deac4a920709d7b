 OTA, an ancient town in the Ado/Odo-Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State, will soon become one of the world’s best tourist centres, the Olota of Ota, Oba (Prof) Abdulkabir Adeyemi Obalanlege, has said. The Olota said Awori traditional rulers and all indigenes at home and abroad are working together to ensure that more development comes to Aworiland through the promotion of cultural heritage and tourism. He was speaking at a press conference in his palace as part of activities lined up to celebrate the 2019 Iganmode Cultural Festival from December 15 to 21. The one-week celebration themed ‘Culture, Technology and Development’ is to examine traditional culture and look into other fundamental values lost to western culture. He said: “The event is being planned to be the biggest annual traditional religious event that will promote love, peace, culture, tourism and increase economic growth of the state and Nigeria as a whole”. The festival’s Chairman, Central Planning Committee, Prince Aina Kazeem, said the Iganmode Cultural Festival developed from the Iganmode Day which had been in existence for 25 years. According to him, the event will begin with a church service on Sunday, December 15, and end with homage to the Olota on December 21. The festival’s consultant, Chief Segun Adewale, said the journey to change the face of tourism in Aworiland had begun.
