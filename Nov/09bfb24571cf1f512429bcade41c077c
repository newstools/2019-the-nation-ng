Human Resources practitioners under the aegis of the Association of Elite Human Resources Professionals (AEHRP) have listed ways through which a practitioner can strike a balance between its dual role of being a strategic business partner and an employee champion. They mentioned professionalism,  understanding business strategies and navigation competencies to guide an organisation beyond murky waters, and adherence to the craft of the business. They said this at the second anniversary of the association held in Lagos, with the theme “HR as a Strategic Business Partner and Employee Champion; Striking a balance”. Head of Human Capital at Letshego Microfinance Bank and guest speaker Emmanuel Micheal,  said as a human relations person, there were two strategic roles one needed to play; first as a business partner to the management and secondly as an employee champion, so it behoved the professional to understand the expectations.  He said for the HR to champion employee cause, the business must make money as, without the money, the needs of the employees won’t be provided for; and without the employees, there would be no way to make the money. So, there is the need for the HR professional to make employees understand their role and the business owner to also do same, he said. Chairman, planning committee of the event and a HR manager, Adekunle Olunloyo,  said to strike a balance, an HR person must be professional, irrespective of where he/she was coming from or who the parties to any issue were. The yes must be yes, so as not to lay a bad precedence, and he should get approvals before taking actions. Olunloyo said the HR practitioner must know how to document events and action plans as the office would always be there no matter who was on ground. Documented records, standards of operations will help the company grow when the current officeholder is not in office, he said.
