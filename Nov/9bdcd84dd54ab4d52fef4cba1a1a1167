Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde said Tuesday that the state would release N500million to the management of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomosho to settle part of the outstanding salaries. He made the disclosure during a meeting with the stakeholders of the institution, held on the campus. Stakeholders at the meeting included the management staff, students, staff unions, among others. They were at the meeting to discuss the challenges facing the institution. Makinde reiterated his administrationâ€™s commitment to funding the educational sector, including state-owned tertiary institutions, in order to restore the pace setting status of the state. Restating that the state has the capacity to solely run the institution, the governor urged the workers both of Oyo and Osun origin to shun malice and rift that could affect the institution. He said the ownership crisis affecting the university would be addressed by the Oyo and Osun state governments. Makinde said the governments are partners in progress toward taking the institution to a greater height. He informed the stakeholders of plans to inaugurate a committee on Wednesday (today) to chart a way forward for the institution. Osun State Government has released N250 million to offset salary arrears. It set up a committee to look at the issues surrounding the joint ownership agreements and proffer a solution to the challenges facing the institution. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Michael Ologunde, said Oyo and Osun are indebted to the tune of over N6billion. Representatives of staff unions and other stakeholders called for sole ownership, steady academic calendar and payment of outstanding salaries. They warned against any attempt to privatise the university.
