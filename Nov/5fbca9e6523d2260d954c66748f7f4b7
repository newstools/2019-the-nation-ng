From Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Wife of Anambra State Governor, Dr. Ebelechukwu Obiano, has challenged students in the state to ensure they put their skills to use to become employers of labour upon graduation. Mrs Obiano gave the advice at the closing of a five-day skill acquisition programme held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka and organised by the Fidelity Bank Youth Empowerment Academy (YEA), in collaboration with Caring Family Enhancement Initiative (CAFE). She praised the students for the seriousness they attached to the training, urging them to remain focused. The governorâ€™s wife, who is the founder of CAFE, also praised Fidelity Bank for keying into the initiative as part of its social responsibility, but regretted that most corporate organisations do not give back to society. Mrs Obiano thanked the host institution for providing the enabling environment needed for the training. She said CAFE had empowered over 4,800 persons, and assured it would continue to partner with the institution to train more students.  Earlier, Head, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability of Fidelity Bank, Mr. Chris Nnakwe said the training was targeted at helping youth to develop skills for wealth in the nearest future. He said the event, the sixth in the series, had earlier been hosted by the University of Nigeria Nsukka; Waziri Umar Federal Polytechnic, Birnin-Kebbi; Federal Polytechnic Oko; River State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt and Bayero University, Kano. According to Nnakwe, the bank had spent over N25 million on each programme, with plans to visit all tertiary institutions in the nation aimed at mentoring beneficiaries in the community of practice. On his part, NAU Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof. Charles Esimone, represented by the Deputy VC, Administration, Prof. Carol Arinze-Umobi, said his administration had always ensured that students had skills before graduating. Over 200 tertiary students benefited from the training.
