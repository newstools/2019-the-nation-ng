From Sunday Egon and Fredrick Okonji Shop owners at the business environment (popularly called computer village) of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun have hiked the prices for photocopy and cyber work services, causing distress to students and others on campus. For years, the price of duplicating a page was N5.00, and N6.00 if both sides of the page are used. Recently, it was increased to N7.00 for a single page and N10 for both sides. Students are not happy that the cost of printing and internet services had increased. An HND II student, who did not wish to be named, told CAMPUSLIFE that she chose PTI because prices of commodities were subsidised so students could afford it while operators do not run at a loss. One of the operators told CAMPUSLIFE that the reason for the sudden price hike was poor profits.  “It appears to us that we are exchanging money for money,” she said, adding that it was a collective decision among shop owners and any among them that does not comply would be punished with shop closure and other penalties,” he said. When CAMPUSLIFE interviewed the welfare director of Students’ Union Government simply called Callistus about the issue, he expressed his disapproval.  He promised to meet with the union leaders with a view to reducing the price by negotiating with the vendors. He also said the student leaders would speak to the school management to consider ways in which both students and vendors can have a good business relation if negotiation with the vendors fails.
