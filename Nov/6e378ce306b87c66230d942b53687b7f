Our Reporter  Nigerian representatives, Enyimba Football Club of Aba and Rangers International of Enugu will know their opponents tomorrow at the draws that will be held by Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) in Cairo, Egypt. A CAF statement confirmed that the draw for the second-tier competition would take place at 1200 local time (1000 GMT), but did not explain the 48-hour delay as the event was originally scheduled for yesterday. The seeded draw will divide the 16 survivors from three qualifying rounds into four groups with the winners and runners-up progressing to the quarter-finals. Hooray (Guinea), Renaissance Breanne (Morocco), twice CAF champions League winners, Enyimba and Al Mary (Egypt) are the top seeds, based on results in the past five CAF seasons.
