Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja  The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday promised that its victorious candidates in last Saturday’s governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states will justify the confidence reposed in them by the electorate in both states. While dedicating the party’s electoral victories in last Saturday’s governorship polls to the people in the two states, the APC assured them that they would reap the dividends of their support for its candidates.
The party, in a statement in Abuja signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, also thanked members of the party in both states for working hard to bring the party victory in their respective states, describing the successes as well-deserved. While it viewed the situation in Bayelsa as landmark, having come against all odds and many established obstacles in Kogi, the APC thanked the people for ditching all alleged orchestrated propaganda and tribal campaigns against the party and its candidate.
On the Kogi West Senatorial District by-election, which was declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the party expressed the confidence that its candidate would eventually reclaim his mandate whenever the remaining part of the election will be concluded. The statement reads: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) thanks the good people of Kogi and Bayelsa states over the party’s resounding victories in the governorship elections. “We congratulate all Nigerians, our teeming supporters and members for the hard-fought election victories. Indeed, these victories are as significant as are well-deserved. “In Kogi, our great party is delighted that the good people of the state ignored the propaganda and clannish campaigns of the opposition and reelected our candidate, Governor Yahaya Bello. We cannot thank the Kogi electorate enough. “Although, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the senatorial election in Kogi West district inconclusive, we are confident that when the supplementary election is held, our candidate, Senator Smart Adeyemi will reclaim his earlier stolen mandate. “Our Party’s victory in Bayelsa State is even more of a landmark. Against all odds and in defiance of the established but retrogressive political order since 1999, Bayelsans decided through their votes to overwhelmingly elect our governorship candidate, David Lyon. “Bayelsans decided to ditch the disastrous regime of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and pitch their tent with a progressive platform. This a sacred trust our candidate and party will not take for granted.
“The Party expresses profound appreciations to President Muhammadu Buhari for his moral support for our candidates; the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, our governors and other party leaders for their support and distinguished presence at our rallies in Kogi and Bayelsa; the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Muhammadu Buhari; wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, for rallying massive support during the final grand rally in Lokoja, Kogi State. “We appreciate the tireless efforts of our National Campaign Councils for Kogi and Bayelsa, headed by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El Rufai and Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, respectively. “We dedicate our Party’s election successes to the good people of the two states, with a solemn promise that our victorious candidates would justify the confidence reposed in them. “Finally, there remains much to be done in ensuring the sanctity of our electioneering process, particularly partisan approach to elections. The PDP must begin to address itself to the new reality that votes are beginning to count. PDP’s retrogressive tactics of massive thumb printing, ballot box snatching, vote buying, thuggery, violence and other illegal schemes will no longer win elections for them.”
