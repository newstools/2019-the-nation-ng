A 31-year-old aluminum fabricator, Anthony Chukwujiobi, on Wednesday, appeared before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly defrauding his client of N964,000. Chukwujiobi, who lives on 5th Avenue, Festac Town, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of fraud and theft. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Ajaga Agboko told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in April on Divine Homes Estate, Ajah, Lagos. He said the defendant collected N964,000 from a client, Mr Chukwuka Ugochukwu, while pretending to be helping him fix shower cubicles and curtain rails in the bathrooms of his newly-built house. Agboko said that after the defendant collected the money, he stopped coming to the site and when he was called on the phone, he gave excuses. He added that the complainant reported to the police who arrested the defendant. Section 287 stipulates three years’ imprisonment for theft while Section 314 prescribes 15 years’ imprisonment for fraud. The Magistrate, Mr T. A. Anjorin-Ajose, granted the defendant N100,000 bail with two sureties in like sum. The case continues December 4.
