Ahead of next Saturday’s governorship and Kogi West Senatorial elections, the Ohinoyi of Ebira land, Alhaji Ado Ibrahim, has once again appealed to politicians to eschew politics of bitterness and hatred. He advised them to rather direct their thinking towards the development of the state. The paramount ruler made the call on Saturday in Okene, when members of the Challenged Parenthood Initiative (CPI) paid him a courtesy visit, as part of the Kogi East and Kogi Central Senatorial Town Hall Meeting. The town hall meeting was organised to sensitise voters and party officials on the need to promote peace, and shun all forms of violence before, during and after the election. Ibrahim said politics should not be seen as a theatre of war for dividing the state, adding that politicians in the country lacked righteousness, the hallmark for national development. He said Kogi State would remain one indivisible entity. According to him: “A state or nation can fall when the people no longer believe in themselves or trust one another. “If politicians have been righteous from the beginning, there won’t be any need to campaign against violence in election. “No nation needs a leader that will make them slaves. All we want is peace and not war. It is high time every citizen came together to think of how we will move forward. “Anyone instigating the other to cause violence in Kogi State should have a rethink, because we are all brothers and sisters in the sight of God.”
