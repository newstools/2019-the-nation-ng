However, the driver was shot while some members of the coaching crew and players were critically injured. The affected persons are currently being treated and are responding to treatment” the post read. The club pleaded with the Federal government, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)  and the League Management Company (LMC) “to further intensify security efforts to ensure the safety of teams who often have no choice than to travel long distances by road, especially clubs owned by Private investors who are made to invest their hard earned money in the growth and development of Nigerian football.” FC Ifeanyi Ubah currently sit 10th place in the NPFL table after five matches. They drew goalless against Lobi Stars at home, in their last outing.
