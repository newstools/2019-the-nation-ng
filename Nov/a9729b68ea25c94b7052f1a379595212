The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to use Kogi and Bayelsa elections to demonstrate its commitment to free, fair and credible elections without being influenced or manipulated. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said this in a statement in Abuja while reacting to INEC’s deployment of extra National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) from other states to Kogi and Bayelsa for the November 16 governorship elections in the two states. He said the PDP already had a due diligence report on each of the deployed commissioners. “Our party recognises that while some are of clean records in their previous responsibilities, there are others who are known to be of questionable characters and fared far below expectations in their responsibilities,” he said. He cautioned INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to note the deployment of  officials with known integrity issues was capable of triggering crisis and jeopardising the credibility of the electoral process. The PDP spokesman advised INEC to allow the will of the people to prevail.
