By Adeniyi Adewoyin Come Sunday, December 22, 2019, Saxophonist Mike Aremu will celebrate two decades of musical excellence with a concert. The event takes place at Intercontinental Hotel Victoria Island, Lagos. And his fellow musicians mostly of the Gospel genre like Tim Godfrey, Sammie Okposo, Tope Alabi, Onos Ariyo and Ibitayo Jeje will also be performing. Mike grew up in Niger State where he was encouraged to play a musical instrument in school. In 1995, he decided to concentrate solely on the Saxophone. He joined House on the Rock’s music team in 1996 having also played with the Compassion Band of the Strong Tower Mission – a charity organisation. In 1999, Mike signed a record deal with Kennis music under which he released two chart topping albums (“Dance” -1999 and “No Shaking” -2002) making total of near two million copies from his first two albums – a record in sales for a Jazz artist. He has also recorded two songs for the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in the US.  Aremu has played alongside notable international artists like Kenny G, India Arie, Hugh Masakela, Najee, Bill Laurance, Kirk Franklin, Marvin Winans, Israel Houton, Mary Mary and Fred Harmond. He has performed eight times at the Lagos EXPERIENCE, a concert tagged to be the world’s largest gospel music concert, attracting a crowd of over 600,000 at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos. Mike Aremu has also performed twice at the London Festival of Life (FOL) an event that is attended by over 40,000 people at the Excel Centre, London.
