 Two more universities – University of Benin (UNIBEN) and the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria – have joined the Congress of University Academics (CONUA). This brings the number of universities under the group, which started as a rival to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), to seven. A statement by its Protem Publicity Secretary, Dr. Ernest Nwoke, said Mr. Sammydavies Osagie-Eweka (Chairman) and Mr. John Osazuwa (Secretary), presented the application to join CONUA from UNIBEN, while Dr. Aminu Abdullahi Isyaku (Chairman) and Dr. Usman Isyaku, of the Department of Geography (Secretary), presented it from ABU. Receiving their application, CONUA’s Protem National Coordinator, Dr. Niyi Sunmonu, of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), said the congress was set to reposition academic staff unionism. Sunmonu, who was represented by the National Secretary, Dr. Henri Oripeloye, said: “The will of the lecturers in congress must in truth move the narrative and not that of a few overlords.” He said CONUA had a vision to restore glory to the university system by putting students’ academic welfare on the front burner; working hard to make perennial strikes a thing of the past and continuously engaging the government of the day as partners in progress, even in situations of agreement and disagreement. Nwoke added that CONUA was receiving requests from many more universities seeking to join CONUA.
