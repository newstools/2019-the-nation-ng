What is hot colour-wise this season on the fashion scene? Red! Bold, bright, warm and energetic, this fiery red hue exudes confidence and unquestionably makes a sartorial statement. The year began with colour-blocking inspired dresses, but these were soon replaced on the runways with the trend of the monochrome and later single colour clothing. And spirited red in diverse shades provides the energy boost needed to revamp your look. It’s the hot colour of the year! It’s exotic, but in a friendly, non-threatening way. Celebrities and many Nollywood A-listers over the months wear them. They go with flats or wedges and chunky jewellery pieces for a top-of-the-world look. Be the centre of attention with a feminine, elegant and hot red dress. Like it or not, red is hot!
