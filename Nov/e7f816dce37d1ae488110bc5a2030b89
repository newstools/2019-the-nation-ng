 AS voters in the Kogi West Senatorial District and Ajaokuta Federal Constituency cast their votes on Saturday, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has called for a credible process. The CDD, in a statement signed by its Director, Idayat Hassan, warned that given the violence, voter intimidation and brazen electoral fraud that characterised the November 16 polls in Kogi and Bayelsa states, the onus is now on all electoral stakeholders, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to redeem themselves. The statement reads: “This supplementary election is an opportunity for the electoral stakeholders, especially INEC, and the security agencies to address the many flaws we saw on November 16. “CDD observation showed that the polls of November 16 were seriously tainted by a myriad of electoral malpractices, which fundamentally undermined the integrity of the process and outcomes in Kogi and Bayelsa states. CDD hopes the security agencies, which failed to protect voters and poll officials the last time out, have taken due note of the local and international condemnation which greeted their abysmal performance on November 16, and are ready to make amends.
