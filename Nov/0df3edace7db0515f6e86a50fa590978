It is now a common development for leading Nigerian pastors to invest in education – tertiary institutions in particular. The Senior Pastor of Kingsway International Christian Centre (KICC), Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo, has joined the growing list. Last week, the pastor held the first convocation ceremony of Kings University, Ode-Omu, Osun State, and it was the talk of the town. At the ceremony, Ashimolowo who is also the chancellor urged graduates to dare, dream and develop themselves. Social Circuit learnt that he set up the university to address certain issues and it’s already living up to its billing. These issues include poor health care delivery in Osun State with very high infant mortality rate and low doctor-patient ratio. The university hopes to adopt very robust information technology in teaching, learning, research, public service and administration. It equally aims to incorporate adequate entrepreneurial studies in the curriculum on order to make the students employers of labour after graduation and ensure the development of a total man.
