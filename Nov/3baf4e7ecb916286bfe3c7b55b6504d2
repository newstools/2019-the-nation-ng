 In commemoration of this year’s World AIDS Day, the Nigeria Business Coalition against AIDS (NiBUCAA) has begun an eight-day free HIV test in locations cutting across local government areas of Lagos State. This was disclosed yesterday by the Executive Secretary of NiBUCAA, Mr. Gbenga Alabi, at a news conference in Lagos. He said as part of NiBUCAA’s contributions towards the global efforts to end AIDS by 2030, the coalition has lined up activities, including free HIV testing services to reach out to 5000 people across the local governments in Lagos State. The free HIV testing services, which will last for eight days, started yesterday and will end on December 2. The locations for the activities are Oshodi market, Dopemu market, Ikorodu, Ojuelegba, Shitta and Badagry community, among others. Another highlight of the activities will be a three-kilometre walk from the National Stadium in Surulere, Lagos to Ojuelegba back to the stadium on November 30, beginning from 7 am to 10 am. “As we commemorate the 2019World AIDS Day, NiBUCAA is making a call for increased access to HIV testing and increased uptake of HIV testing. Around the world, 37 million people are living with HIV; yet a quarter do not know that they have the virus.”
