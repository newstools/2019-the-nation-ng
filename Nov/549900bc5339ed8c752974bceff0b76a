 THE Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited has said it will begin to discharge liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also called cooking gas, to the New Oil Jetty (NOJ) terminal in Lagos. Its Manager, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, Mrs Sophia Horsfall, made this known on Monday in Lagos. Horsfall spoke against the backdrop of marketers’ allegations of indiscriminate hike in the price of cooking gas due to inability of NLNG to meet up market demands. LPG marketers, under the aegis of the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM), had on November 7 raised the alarm over indiscriminate hike in the price of gas by 75 per cent within two weeks. Its Executive Secretary, Mr Bassey Essien, said the price of 20 metric tonnes of LPG, which cost between N3.15 and N3.5 million, had suddenly moved to N4.2 million. Horsfall said that following the conclusion of technical approval processes required, the company would deliver LPG to the Nigeria market via the Stockgap Terminal and the two terminals in Lagos. The spokesperson said the NLNG was most pleased to say that it commenced delivery to this terminal in October. “Going forward, we will deliver LPG to the Nigeria market via the Stockgap Terminal and the two terminals in Lagos as well as other terminals that pass the strict technical compatibility reviews. “In addition to helping with the penetration objective, this effort has also improved the supply chain efficiency with improved value potential for industry participants,” Horsfall said. Horsfall said the company had in 2007 undertook the championing of deepening the domestic cooking gas market and had remained the major local supplier of LPG volumes into the market.
