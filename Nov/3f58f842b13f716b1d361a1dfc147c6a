As part of efforts towards to deliver quality healthcare service to the people, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), has signed a private-public partnership with Lordus Medical and Surgical Supply Company to ensure uninterrupted gas supply is readily available in the hospital with a view to serving the people of Lagos and its environs better. At the signing of the MoU, the Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof Adetokunbo Fabamwo said that he was optimistic about the positive results expected from the gas production project. “We have the approval of the board of LASUTH to take this giant step as it will bring succor to the patients who are at the receiving end. Late supply from reputable companies in recent times had become epileptic; the old plant has run its course for about 10 years; hence the need for this new strategy which we believe would fulfill our needs in terms of steady oxygen supply in LASUTH.” Dr. Ade Tinubu, CEO of Lordus Medical and Surgical Supply Company, who appreciated the members of the board of the hospital, noted that the partnership with LASUTH has come to stay as the company plans to ensure the partnership runs effectively to fulfill the purpose for which it was set up. “We are grateful to the board for this opportunity to help transform healthcare delivery in LASUTH. We will ensure the process is seamless and effective,” he said. Other management staff present at the signing included Dr Mustapha Ibrahim, Director of Clinical Services and Training; Olatokunbo Adio, Director Hospital Administration and Human Resources, and  Adebola Aina, Assistant Director, Nursing Services.
