By Adegunle Olugbamila  Nigerian Association for Young Adults (NAYA), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) has urged the youths not to be so obsessed with seeking greener pastures outside the country’s shores, but be determined to contribute to the development of their fatherland. The organisation, which is based in Canada, also admonished the young ones to embrace the culture of giving despite the country’s socio-economic challenges. NAYA President, Mr. Shola Agboola, spoke to CAMPUSLIFE ahead of the the organisation’s donations of medical equipment valued at N784 million across some hospitals in Niger State. Agboola said aside its various humanitarian efforts, NAYA established 18 years ago, has been at the vanguard of championing a new leadership which will have more representation from the youth segment.  Balogun, who is serving his second term, notes that NAYA believes in the value of giving. He said membership of NAYA comprises mostly youths and young adults in Canada who understand the socio-economic challenges back at home, and have therefore been making selfless donations of items ranging from laptop computers, books on STEM, hospital equipment as well as instructional materials for pupils. Agboola recalled that in January, NAYA donated some instructional materials and hospital equipment to some hospital and schools in Abia, adding that the organisatiion had just taken consignment of another set of items that would be distributed at a another yet-to-be announced state.
