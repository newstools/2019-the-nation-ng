A 42-year-old driver with the Imo State Transport Company (ITC) Okorie Agwu has told a family court in Owerri, the state capital, how he deceived, defiled and impregnated an 11-year-old girl. Agwu said a N100 note was the bait. The girl was a junior secondary school (JSS 1) student in 2017 when the driver allegedly lured her with N100 note and repeatedly raped her in the bushes and uncompleted buildings. Agwu, who was remanded in the Owerri Correctional Centre by the court, said he drove her to secluded places, including the desolate Akachi Tower area on Owerri-Aba Road, where he molested her. This, he said, continued until the minor, now 13 years old, became pregnant this year. The Nation learned that Agwu, who hails from  Arochukwu, Abia State, is a father of five, and separated from his wife. The victim, now heavy with child, told police that Agwu offered her N100 and promised to buy her a cellphone, if she became his friend. This, according to her, started some time in 2017, when she was in JSS 1 and continued whenever she was returning from school. She noted that even at that, she declined his offer. She told police that the day she consented to his demands was when he drove her into a bush, tore her clothing and raped her, and she went home bleeding. The victim lives with her grandfather and stepmother, the latter reportedly threatening to send her out of the house, saying she cannot handle her ante-natal and post-natal care. However, a non-governmental organisation, Virgin Heart Foundation and Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) Imo State Chapter,  have pledged psycho-social support, medical assistance and legal support for the victim. The convener of Virgin Heart Foundation, Peace Dike charged security agencies and the judiciary to be proactive in the fight against sexual violence against women and girls.
