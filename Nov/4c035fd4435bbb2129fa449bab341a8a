All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on Tuesday paid tribute to former Petroleum Resources Minister, Prof. Tam David-West, who died at 83. He described the former minister as a nationalist and social critic who spoke truth to power. In a condolence message issued by his Media Office, Asiwaju Tinubu said he would personally miss the former minister because he was one leader he admired and exchanged ideas with. The statement reads: “Prof. Tam David-West was a nationalist, leader of substance and social critic who regularly spoke truth to power. “His voice was always that of caution and restraint to steer the leadership away from the path of unconstitutionality and danger. “He was highly-principled and morally upright. Somebody who served as Minister of Petroleum and Energy under Muhammadu Buhari as a military leader and won Buhari’s respect and admiration must be a man of integrity and honesty. “David-West and I often speak to interface on issues and to exchange ideas. He was one intellectual and leader I admire. I will personally miss him. “I mourn with his family, both immediate and extended. I mourn with the people of Buguma, Kalabari Kingdom, the government and people of Rivers State and Nigeria, which he served selflessly. “My prayer is that God Almighty grant him eternal rest.  I also hope and pray that his good legacies will continue to endure.”
