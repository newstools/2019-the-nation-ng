Sanni Onogu, Abuja  Former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has denied nursing any ambition for the 2023 presidential race of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Amosun who represents Ogun Central in the Senate disclosed this in a statement from media office signed by Alhaji Bola Adeyemi. The statement titled: “2023: Count Me Out of the Distraction – Senator Ibikunle Amosun” reads: “My attention has just been drawn to a poster, suggesting I had thrown my hat into the 2023 Presidential race. “It definitely belies logic that such a move would be my preoccupation or in any way linked to me, when indeed I have not spent a year in my current assignment as the Senator representing Ogun Central District. “It goes without saying that anyone nursing a Presidential ambition at a time President Muhammadu Buhari has just begun to consolidate on the successes of his first term, is not only an enemy of the Nigerian State, but clearly does not desire any good for Mr President. “The poster and any of such publication is nothing but sheer distraction. “As a Senator, my hands are full and I am committed to working with fellow patriots on how best to move our nation forward by supporting and working with President Buhari. “There is a time for everything. The time to address 2023 is clearly not anywhere close.”
