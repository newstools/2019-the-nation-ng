The contributions of the late Deji Sasegbon (SAN) to the judiciary are unparalleled, Vice President Osinbajo has said. Sasegbon died on December 10, 2016. While alive, he published the Nigerian Supreme Court Cases (NSCC) in 38 volumes, the Legal Desk Book, Nigerian Companies and Allied Matters Law and Practice in six volumes and Sasegbon’s Laws of Nigeria in 30 volumes. A book he began before he died, Sasegbon’s Judicial Dictionary of Nigeria (in 7 volumes), was completed by his widow, Oge, also a lawyer, along with DSC Publications Deputy Editor-in-Chief Ehi Esoimeme and a team of scholars and editors. Osinbajo urged Nigerians to commit to excellence as the late Sasegbon did. He praised the publication’s utility value, saying it was a must-have for all desirous of improving the quality of legal practice and jurisprudence in Nigeria. Osinbajo said late Sasegbon’s contribution to the legal profession through his over 78 volumes of law publications is “unparalleled”. Eminent lawyer Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), who chaired the event, described the publication as epochal. Similar views were expressed by judges, lawyers and others, including activist-lawyer Femi Falana (SAN), who described Sasegbon as a pacesetter and the publication as an invaluable resource. The reviewer, Prof Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN) said the dictionary was the definitive encyclopedia of legal definitions of Nigerian law. According to him, with over 150, 000 terms, the dictionary is a complete statement of the entire body of Nigerian legal definitions as rendered in the language of the courts and based on superior courts cases.
