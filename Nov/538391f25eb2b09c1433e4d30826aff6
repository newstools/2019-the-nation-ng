Vincent Ikuomola, Seme Border An end to the issues leading to the closure of the country’s land borders seems to be far from over, as the Federal Government said nothing much has been done by the two major neighbouring countries. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said arrest and seizures made in the last two weeks indicated that Benin and Niger Republic have not done much to address the issues. Mohammed who led the Federal Government delegation on tour of the Seme land border said goods worth about N4 billion were seized while 296 illegal migrants were arrested in the last two weeks. Mohammed who was accompanied by the minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, and also minister of state, Finance and National Planning, reiterated that National interest must come first. He however assured that government at the highest level are doing everything possible to end the issue. The minister also addressed the protesters who staged a peaceful demonstration demand for quick resolution of the issues leading to the closure of the country’s borders. The protesters were carrying placard with various inscriptions. He said that the partial closure of the land borders has so far curbed the smuggling of foreign rice into the country, in addition to other prohibited items. Besides, he said that 95 per cent of illicit drugs and weapons that are being used for acts of terrorism and kidnapping in Nigeria today come in through our porous borders. Other items seized include; 38,743-50kg bags of parboiled foreign rice; 514 vehicles; 1,012 drums filled with PMS; 5,400 Jerricans of vegetable oil; 346 motorcycles; 10, 553 Jerricans of PMS and 136 bags of NPK fertilizer used for making explosives.
