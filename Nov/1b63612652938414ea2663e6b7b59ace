Due to the vivid impressions they created in the November 16 governorship election, which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) judged were convincing enough to enable them be declared elected, both Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and David Lyon of Bayelsa State have underscored and energised the quaint new politics and ethics of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Mr Bello, according to INEC, beat all rivals, including and especially his closest rival, Musa Wada of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); and David Lyon also defeated, among other candidates, Duoye Diri of the PDP. APC leaders — from the president downwards — are ecstatic about the electoral feats attributed to the duo by the electoral commission. Both governors-elect are themselves thrilled that they had been declared victorious, in the case of Mr Bello, for another four years, and in the case of Mr Lyon for a first term as governor. They will be sworn in early next year. If the APC is disturbed by the victories they grabbed in Kogi and Bayelsa, they have not given any indication to that effect. The governors-elect and party leaders have suggested that their victories are a call to the party to entrench itself. In particular, in the case of Mr Lyon, Bayelsa party leaders suggest that winning the state would give their party a foothold (which they misrepresent as a footprint) in the oil-rich state. They see the state as a cash cow, not a prospective developmental lodestar. Though the same APC leaders have been less strident in celebrating their candidate’s victory in Kogi, they have nevertheless acted and spoke self-assuredly and confidently about the future of their party. Speaking on Channels Television, Kogi’s Mr Bello dismissed insinuations of a contrived victory or of his non-performance in his first term. He indicated very clearly what his second term would look like and what it would portend for the future of the APC. Sneering at sceptics, he argued: “All these reports of me owing salaries are lies. Past governors of Kogi State were owing salaries starting from Audu to my immediate predecessor. Kogi state is not owing any dime at the state level; what is left is the ten percent from the previous government.” He had done well, he said, in his first term, and therefore deserved re-election. He poured scorn on the import of Kaduna State governor kneeling to beg Kogites before the election, facetiously declaring, “As for El-Rufai kneeling, he was begging that Kogi people should forgive Bello for ensuring security and ensuring the state was peaceful and not because he could not pay salaries.” The governor’s logic may be warped and risible, but he has never dissuaded himself from proudly dishing out stuffs like that to the incredulous public. Continuing, and in particular referencing the violence that attended the poll, he argued:  “After I was declared winner, a PDP thug stabbed somebody and ran into the house of their women leader, but he was caught and dealt with. My deputy governor-elect’s wife was shot at but thank God she didn’t die, the police are looking into it and would bring the culprits to book.” Here he was defensive rather than remorseful and empathetic. On the whole, here is how he summed up the poll that has returned him to office: “The conduct of the election was quite very credible, a level-playing field was provided and it was free and fair. In every election, there is bound to be one issue or the other and you can’t take a pocket of issues to judge the general conduct of the election. Regarding the comment of the civil society organisation, they are entitled to their own opinion but let us know the parameters with which they are judging this election. How many polling units did they visit out of 2,548 polling units, 239 wards and 21 local governments across the difficult terrains of this state? How many people have they reached out to? Have they interviewed the electorate? So what are their yardsticks?” Indeed, more telling is the APC chairman’s opinion of the Kogi victory. Mincing words, without appearing to do so, Mr Adams Oshiomhole declared: “I think that for analysts and keen observers of Nigeria’s politics, particularly the geo-political politics, (whatever that means) you will agree that the victory of Yahaya Bello in Kogi State represents many things for those who truly believe that Nigerian politics should move away from sentiments, to dealing with people for who they are rather than where they come from. So, for us in the APC, we are very proud and we presented him to the president. The president was very proud, of course he congratulated him; he was happy to see his certificate and he has encouraged us to recognize that the reward for hard work as they say is more work. And I am sure that governor Yahaya Bello having passed through the learning curve is going to approach the second term with all the vigour with eye on posterity and legacy marks in the development of Kogi state.” It is engaging to see how Mr Oshiomhole said so much so little. Put differently, it is clear how he restrained himself nearly so expertly by asserting and defending the victory they have claimed in the Kogi State poll in terms that saw him admitting very little. Even for so uppity and definitive a chairman, the last may not have been heard from him on the Kogi and Bayelsa polls. Somewhat differently, the less cocky Mr Lyon considers his victory as dynamically incontrovertible. Said the governor-elect, his statement very likely edited for finesse by reporters: “I thank INEC for its commitment towards the election in spite of pressure to do otherwise. To all the people of Bayelsa, this is the time to come together to build our dear state; my victory at the poll is for the people and I am assuring you, my people, that I will not fail you. The APC led administration will be for a total change which Bayelsa is going to be witnessing in the next few months; my belief in this context is that everyone is a winner. Let us come together and ensure that the state is developed and there will be security for investors.” Buttressing the governor-elect’s enthusiasm, party chairman, Mr Oshiomhole raucously declared the APC victory in the Bayelsa governorship poll as deserving and indisputable. Minister of State for Petroleum and former Bayelsa governor, Timipre Sylva, was philosophical in assigning  meanings and values to the Bayelsa poll victory, a least as far as the APC is concerned. With flourish he describes it as a watershed. According to him: “We are happy with this victory because for us it is very significant. This gives our party a footprint (he probably means a toehold or foothold) in the Niger Delta, which is very key to us. It gives us more of a national outlook; we have always been a national party but this gives us even a bigger national outlook. I have always said that if our party doesn’t have this much of a footprint in the breadbasket of the country, it was not too good for us. But now we have it and I want to assure you that from a small seed, the biggest tree will grow. From here we will gradually grow the party in the south-south and the southeast. APC is a good product just like our governor and we intend to sell that good product in the whole of the south-south and the southeast.” Many of his claims and assignations are of course contentious, but in the flush of victory, who is to deny him his extraordinary flights of fancy? Whether anyone likes it or not, going forward, the APC may have already recognised how easy it is to secure electoral victory by any means possible. Bayelsa and Kogi may become, for the party, the new political totems, one which clears the way for future aggrandising politics, one devoid of scruples and laced with ethical booby traps. As President Muhammadu Buhari himself said in reference to the controversies he believed festooned his party’s poll victories, the losers must channel their grievances democratically by petitioning the courts. But he doubtless saw any effort in that direction as futile or superfluous. The Bayelsa and Kogi polls were the hardest for the party to win in recent times. The way the party sees it now, future polls will present a far lesser challenge to their uncanny expertise and effortless propaganda. The APC may not be as popular as they hope, and their candidates in the last polls probably not as spectacular as they had set out to get, but they now know how to get water out of a rock. Soon, they will be walking on water.
