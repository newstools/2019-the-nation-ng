The United Kingdom (UK) said it is concerned by the escalating violence from both police and protesters occupying university campuses in Hong Kong. A Foreign Office spokesperson made this known in a statement yesterday. “The UK is seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protestors and the authorities around Hong Kong university campuses,” the spokesperson said. The autonomous Chinese city’s Polytechnic University became a scene of tumult on Sunday when protesters holed up inside threw petrol bombs and fired arrows at the police. The police responded with tear gas and water cannon. The police denied media reports that they had tried to enter the campus in a pre-dawn raid. Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police. Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent.
