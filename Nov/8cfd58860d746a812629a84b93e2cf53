Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa  Former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri, has said that he never asked the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, to nullify the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Describing the judgement delivered by Justice Jane Inyang nullifying the candidacy of Chief David Lyon as controversial, Lokpobiri, who contested the primaries said he only prayed to be declared the winner of the internal poll and authentic candidate of the party. Lokpobiri said that he would file a stay of execution and appeal the judgement. He said: “I pray for the Federal High Court in Yenagoa to declare myself winner of the September 4 APC gubernatorial primary election but the judge gave a controversial judgement, which does not in anyway correlate with the prayers i presented before the court. “However, I do not pray for the court to nullify the primary election but rather prayed the court to declare me winner, On this note I have been briefed by my lawyers so we will file a motion of stay of execution in the court of appeal. “Furthermore, we are law abiding citizens that’s the more reason we will sort this matter out in court, therefore I urge everybody to be calm for there is no cause for alarm. “I want to also use this medium to appreciate you for believing in me. Many have fasted and prayed just to make sure I win this matter before the court. But I assure you that your efforts will not be in vain”.
