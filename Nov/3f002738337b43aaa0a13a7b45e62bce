 Tragedy struck at the weekend in Akaeze, Ivo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State when a dilapidated building in the community collapsed and killed three siblings. A source in the community told The Nation that the three kids were sleeping in the mud building with another sibling and their mother, when the building caved in and fell on them. The names of the children were given simply as Mmesoma, 11; Onyinyechi, 5, and John, 3. They were all children of a man identified simply as Okereke, in the area. The tragedy occurred on Friday night. Okereke’s wife, Elizabeth, The Nation learnt, had urged her husband to work towards relocating the family to another building as she was afraid of the building, which was dilapidated. “But the family could not afford funds to make alternative arrangements for relocation as a result of hardship,” a source said. The deceased children were removed from the building by neighbours and have been buried, while their mother and her only surviving son were still receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital as at the time of this report. Police spokesman, Loveth Odah, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said she had yet to get details of the incident. She promised to get back our correspondent with the details of the incident. “I called the DPO of Akaeze Development Centre and he said he would text me the details, but he has not. I am still waiting for his text,” she said. But she had yet to do so at the time of this report. However, Coordinator of Akaeze Development Centre, Onyebuchi Ogbadu, confirmed the incident. “When I received the information, I rushed to the place and saw that three kids were dead instantly while their mother and one of the children were rushed to the hospital. It was very critical. The incident happened on Friday night,” he said.
