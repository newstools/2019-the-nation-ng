Stefanos Tsitsipas stunned six-time champion Roger Federer to advance to the final of the 2019 ATP Tour Finals in his debut at the event. The 21-year-old Greek is taking tennis by storm and overcame short rest after a gruelling match against Rafael Nadal on Friday night to knock out the favourite 6-3, 6-4. With Federer 17 years his senior – the greatest age difference in the tournament’s history – Tsitsipas took advantage of the Swiss maestro’s inability to convert 10 break points. The 20-time Grand Slam champion’s sloppy start proved costly, messing up two easy slams at the net to allow Tsitsipas to lock up a break advantage. A glimmer of hope was handed back to Federer at 2-4 but he spurned three break points, eventually conceding an epic 13-minute game, which allowed the youngster to move on an seal a breathtaking first set. Despite trading breaks at the start of the second, Tsitsipas overcame the London crowd’s support for the veteran and moved towards the finish line. Federer put up one last fight, but the story of the match reared its head once more, as two more break points slipped by at 3-5 before the compelling contest drew to a close and perhaps propelled Tsitsipas to the very top of the game heading into 2020. First though is the small matter of Sunday’s final, against the winner of Dominic Thiem vs Alexander Zverev, with the Greek absolutely thrilled by his performance. “Wow, Jesus, I’m so proud of myself, a great performance,” the Greek said after sealing victory. “I enjoyed my time on the court. It’s a mental struggle, I’m really proud to save so many break points.
