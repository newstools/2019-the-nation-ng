No fewer than 10 persons were feared burnt to death in a ghastly motor accident along Ife-Ibadan expressway on Thursday afternoon. The accident which was said to have involved four vehicles, reportedly happened around 3.30pm at a spot known as Alasepe before Ikire, the headquarters of Irewole Local Government Area of Osun State. The mishap involving a petrol tanker, two articulated trucks carrying cement and a commercial bus caused traffic gridlock for hours on the busy road, making drivers ply other routes. An eye witness account revealed the commercial bus coming from Ile-Ife to Ibadan rammed into the two trucks and the petrol-laden tanker before they all went up in flame. It was also gathered that the two trucks and the petrol tanker were already locked in an accident before the driver of the commercial bus on top speed rammed into them. It was gathered that many passengers of the bus lost their lives, while the drivers of the trucks reportedly escaped from the scene of the accident. Meanwhile, some of the survivors but with varying degrees of injury were said to have rushed to an unknown hospital by the ambulances belonging to the Osun State government and the FRSC. Also, the police were said to have cordoned off the spot while the men of the FRSC were controlling and diverting vehicles to the other lane of the expressway. However, casualty figure was not confirmed by our correspondent as no officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) could be reached to speak on the accident.
