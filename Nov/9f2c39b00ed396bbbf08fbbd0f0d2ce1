The recent sack of some aides of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is part of an ongoing reorganisation at the Presidency aimed at enhancing service delivery to Nigerians, President Muhammadu Buhari has said. Buhari told reporters in Abuja on his arrival from a two week private visit to UK on Friday that it was true that 35 aides were sacked in the VP’s office, but explained that the aim was all about reorganisation at the presidency. He expressed disappointment at the ethnic and political coloration given the exercise. ‘‘They said 35 people were sacked in the vice president’s office. We just created some ministries and we reorganised and people are giving it ethnic and political dimensions. It is unfortunate,’’ he said. His Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity,  Malam Garba Shehu, quoted him as adding: “We are going to work harder and be accountable. We have tried to make Nigerians understand why we do certain things. Accountability from bottom to top is absolutely necessary. ‘‘Whoever is responsible for government property, [should know] it is public property, it is not personal and he has to manage it according to the law. ‘‘That’s what I expect and I think that we have been around long enough to impress on people that we mean what we say.”
