Akeem Lawal  NIGERIA striker Victor Osimhen is confident of victory for the Super Eagles when they tackle Squirrels of Benin in today’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying Matchday 1 at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo. The Lille forward said he was confident since the rank of the team has been bolstered with the likes of Samuel Chukwueze and Samuel Kalu coupled with the return of Captain Ahmed Musa. “I’m hundred per-cent ready,” the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup winner said in an interview with NationSport. “I will try to get the goals for the team. I am not the only player that can score in the team, we have Samuel Chukwueze, Samuel Kalu and of course, our captain Ahmed Musa is back in the team. “So, the confidence in the camp is really high and we are looking forward to the game. The Akpabio Stadium is like home for us always and we are ready to give our best and make the fans happy. “We are going all out to get the win, nothing but the win. And of course, we have our fans also as the 12th man on the pitch. “We are going to give everything that we have and get the three points,” assured the 20- year-old, who has scored nine goals with two assists in all competitions this season for Lille. Meanwhile, Osimhen has revealed if he were to choose, he would love to play in the Spanish La Liga. “I am a big fan of La Liga,” the Super Eagles striker was quoted as saying in an interview with L’Equipe. “It’s my dream to play there.” Only recently Spanish media linked him with a big-money move to Barcelona. However, Osimhen has a contract with Lille till 2024 and he will respect it despite the speculations about his future. “I’ve always been willing to take the next step, but I’m in Lille,” he maintained. “I love the people. If big clubs keep an eye on me, it’s great for me, but it’s up to the club to decide if I stay or leave. I will not object.”
