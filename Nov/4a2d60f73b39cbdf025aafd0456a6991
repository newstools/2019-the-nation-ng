Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has lamented the inability of the CHAN Eagles to qualify for next year’s tournament in Cameroon, while picking holes on the organisation of the NPFL. The home-based Eagles were eliminated from Cameroon 2020 CHAN by Togo. “This (CHAN exit) is not good sign for the local players, if they could not go to CHAN,” he said. “We therefore need better infrastructure, better level of football and for the players to play regularly, not for the league to be off for several months, players cannot be fit without regular competition.” Rohr restated his position that players from the domestic league must improve and be better than their Europe-based counterparts for him to consider them on his team. “They have to be better than the players in Europe,” he stated. “I take only the best players. Do you know of a coach who does not play his best players?”, he queried.
