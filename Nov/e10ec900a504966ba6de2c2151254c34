By Mustapha Temidayo  If you’ve ever met someone likable by their smile, yet you couldn’t explain specifically why you like them. You can learn to have a charming smile too, and all it takes is some modifications to your behavior. In silence and say to yourself, I will address every individual I come in contact with and say I Love You. Though spoken in silence these words will shine in your eyes, unwrinkled your brow, bring a smile to your lips, and echo in your voice; and the opposite sex heart will be opened.  There’s no doubt that making eye contact is one of the most powerful body language arsenals in all great people and it is the basic of customer service relation. However, doing it wrong will make you look creepy. Smile while making eye contact to instantly make yourself irresistible. Ten seconds is a safe time limit before looking elsewhere. Otherwise, you will trigger a person’s defense mechanism and make them feel uncomfortable.  The moment you perform the above techniques, the next is to be sure you don’t have a bad breadth, because if you do this could get the other person uncomfortable.  This involves turning your entire body towards another person. This body language trick got its name from the way most folks turn their attention to a baby. When being introduced to someone, make sure to give your undivided attention by pivoting your body towards them. This delivers the message that they’re special and you’re interested in them. True interest in another person makes you super irresistible in return.  The handshake that we practice today was, in fact, an early custom to prove that you’re not hiding any weapons. That’s why we are suspicions when people don’t show their hands. With this in mind, use gestures to make you the most memorable person in the room.
