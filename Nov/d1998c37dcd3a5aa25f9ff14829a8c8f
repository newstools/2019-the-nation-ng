  International gospel artiste, Don Moen, alongside other frontline musicians, including Frank Edwards, have urged Nigerian youths to shun criminal activities in the face of hardship. The artistes who performed live at the Festival of Champions (FOC) programme organised by the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Champions Cathedral in Effurun, Delta state, made the call during a press conference in Ekpan, Uvwie council area of Delta state. Responding to questions from newsmen, Frank Edwards, posited that “hard times and disappointments” will come, but focusing on positive goals, and with God’s help, things will turn out well in the future. RCCG’s assistant general overseer, Pastor Johnson Odesola, who was guest speaker at the praise service, charged the congregation against allowing situations to set “limitations” in their lives. Speaking with newsmen, the host and senior pastor of Champions Cathedral, Pastor Emmanuel Emefienim, said the programme was aimed at “bringing down the presence of God through quality praise and worship”. Emefienim explained that God values sincere praise and worship, hence the array of gospel artistes. Speaking on the theme of the programme, tagged ‘unstoppable,’ he added that the Festival of Champions is also “an avenue to win souls for Jesus Christ, bring healing, deliverance and turnarounds, in the lives of people”. He further expressed thanks to the General Overseer of the RCCG Worldwide, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, as well as other ministers of the church for their support. Other gospel singers who graced the programme are American singer, Travis Greene, popular saxophonist, Kunle Ajayi, Beejay Sax, Mercy Chinwo, Chioma Jesus, Big Bolaji, Tim Godfrey, Bukola Bekes and Tosin Bee.
