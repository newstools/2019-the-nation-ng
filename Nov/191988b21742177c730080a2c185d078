 Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to focus more attention on rail transportation to connect the whole of the state. Obasa made the appeal while giving his remarks after the governor presented the year 2020  budget estimate of N1.168trillion to the assembly at plenary in Lagos. The speaker said no amount of road patching, rehabilitations and constructions will really solve the transportation problem in the state because of the influx of people into Lagos on daily basis. “To indeed move Lagos forward, there is the need to focus more attention on rail to connect the entire Lagos,” Obasa said.

But we should start from somewhere. Dubai did not start in a day. They laid the foundation and continue building on it. Now, it is an envy of all. “Likewise, our education and health sectors need adequate attention. Year in, year out, provisions are being made for these sectors. But they have not been well sustained. It is our hope that this time, it will take a different and positive dimension.” The speaker promised that as representatives in the assembly they will not relent in their agitation for quality governance and qualitative representation.
