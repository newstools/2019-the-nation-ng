The Kano Road and Traffic Agency (KAROTA) has impounded illicit solutions worth N20 million in the Sabon Gari Area of Fagge Local Government Area of the state. This was contained in a statement issued on Thursday by the Agency’s spokesman Nabilusi Abubakar Kofar. The statement confirmed that the seizure came following intelligence gathering by KAROTA operatives that the substances were being stored in a house on Emir Road, Sabon Gari. Nabilusi said the Agency is part of the state’s task force charged with fighting abuse and supply of hard drugs in Kano. He said the traffic agency personnel raided the Sabon Gari house on Wednesday after obtaining a court order, “where we discovered premises stocked with 157 cartons of the illicit substance and subsequently confiscated it.” The statement added that the illegal products have been evacuated from the store of the building. Managing Director, Baffa Dan’Agundi said the agency would do everything to call road users to order against violating traffic rules and regulations in the state. Dan’Agundi lamented the increasing cases in the consumption of illegal substances in the state, adding that only God knows the danger it would have posed in the state if the substance had found its way into the market. Baffa further said that analysis has shown that most cases of reckless driving, speeding and beating traffic are associated with the consumption of hard drugs by drivers. He warned drivers to avoid hard drugs.
