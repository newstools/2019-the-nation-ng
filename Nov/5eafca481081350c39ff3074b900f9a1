 AFTER competing at the 2019 ITTF Team World Cup in Tokyo, Aruna Quadri and Olajide Omotayo will on today at the Tips Arena in Linz, begin their campaign in the men’s singles event of the ITTF World Tour Platinum tagged Austrian Open. Quadri and Omotayo left Tokyo, Japan, at the weekend to compete at the last tour of 2019 in Linz, Austria. The $260,000 prize- tournament will have most of the best players in the world in attendance as it is the last major tour event the year with Quadri and Omotayo hoping to use the tournament to shore up their global rating for the end-of-year ranking. Despite being ranked in top 20 in the world, Quadri will start his campaign from the second round as only the top 14 best players in the world made the seeding list and they will be joined by host nation’s duo of Robert Gardos and Daniel Habesohn to complete the 16-man seeding list. Omotayo will also start from the second round of the preliminary and he is expected to face Germany’s Tobias Hippler today. With the 2019 ITTF Men’s World Cup and 2019 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals set to take place in the coming months, China’s Ma Long (31) and Ding Ning (29) have taken the decision not participate in Austrian Open. For the reigning men’s World Champion, Ma Long, this comes after he missed out on the main stages of the same competition last year when he had to withdraw after the first round due to injury.
