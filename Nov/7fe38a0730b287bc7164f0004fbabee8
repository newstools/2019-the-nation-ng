The wife of Lagos State governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has reaffirmed the commitment of the current administration in the state of its readiness to give prompt attention to public health. SanwoOlu stated this recently when a team of Public Health Sustainable Advocacy Initiative (PHSAI) paid an advocacy visit to her office in Lagos. The wife of the governor intimated the team of her plan to meet with all the 57 chairmen where they will be charged to step up efforts in delivering quality health care services to their people. Acknowledging the work of NURHI 2 in the health sector of the State, the first lady regretted that NURHI2 project is winding up at a time when the new Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration is gearing up. She stressed that it is now a challenge as a concerned government to practically own the health interventions even when NURHI2 and other implementing health partners have gone. High point of the visit was induction of the first lady as the FP/ LPAY Champion in Lagos State. She thanked PHSAI for not giving up in government objectives and assured the team her willingness to always partner with the group. Speaking earlier, the chairman of Public Health Sustainable Advocacy Initiative (PHSAI), Barr. Ayo Adebusoye, said the core objective of the visit to the first lady was borne out of her passion and interests in public health having served as a medical director at Shomolu General Hospital and to advocate for ways to improve sexual and reproductive health of young people in the state.
