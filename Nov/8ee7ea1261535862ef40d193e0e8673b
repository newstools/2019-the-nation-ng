 THE National Headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has clarified that no judgment barred the All Progressives Congress (APC) from partaking in the Saturday governorship election. INECâ€™s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, insisted that the judgment of the Federal High Court in Yenagoa delivered by Justice Jane Inyang did not make an order stopping APC as a political party from participating in the election. Okoye, who spoke on Sunrise Daily, a magazine programme on Channels Television, said the poll would go on as planned by the commission.
