The chairman of FBNHoldings Plc, Oba Otudeko, has continued to prove his worth as a master strategist who understands the business terrain. Recently, he led directors of FBN Holdings, First Bank of Nigeria Limited and FBNBank Ghana Limited, on a courtesy call to the President of the Republic of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa-Akufo-Addo, in Accra. The visit, it was gathered, was to show appreciation to the president for participating in the First Bank of Nigeria Limitedâ€™s 125th-anniversary activities held earlier this year as well as updating him on recent investment activities.   Otudeko told President Akufo-Addo that FBNHoldings had a strong belief in the Ghanaian economy, which was seen in the recapitalization of FBNBank Ghana by its parent bank, First Bank of Nigeria. The chairman also heaped praise on the president for giving the youth opportunities to serve in his government, saying it would prepare them to take over leadership in future. Akufo-Addo thanked Otudeko while recounting the economic ties existing between Ghana and Nigeria. He also appreciated FBN Holdings for investing in Ghana and assured that the government would provide the necessary support to help them thrive. For the voyage, Otudeko was accompanied by Chairman, Board of Directors, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Ibukun Awosika; Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc, U. K. Eke; Chief Executive Officer, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, among others.
