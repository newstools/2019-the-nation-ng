 Where is our son? Who abducted him? These are the posers on the lips of distraught family members of one Michael Osahon, who was allegedly arrested and detained by a policeman simply identified as Joshua. According to the family, Osahon was accused by the ‘policeman’ of defrauding an unnamed man of a sum N45,000 and since then his whereabouts have remained unknown after the said policeman took him away to Abuja. A petition had been written to the Human Rights Commission, Public Complaints Commission as well as the police in Abuja, while efforts made by the family to locate Osahon’s whereabouts had been futile. A copy of one of the petitions dated October 16, 2019 and signed by Onatubo Aina, reads: ‘’ On September 23, 2019, a policeman named Joshua claimed to have come from a police formation in Abuja arrested Michael Osahon and subsequently took him to Abuja, over a complaint that he received a sum of N45,000 from  one man at Oluwole area of Lagos Island, for the purpose of processing a Canadian visa; since then, nothing has been heard of his whereabouts. ‘’The whole story is causing his family grave anxiety and indeed sleepless nights and why police should things to continue this way, hence, we decided to bring this thing to your attention.’’ It was said that the policeman had turned down the request of Osahon’s family members to know the exact station where he is detained. The ‘policeman’ was also said to have been making several monetary demands from Osahon’s family members. One of such was Tuesday, when the ‘policeman’ again called Osahon’s wife on her mobile phone asking for a sum of N3000 for treatment of her husband for undisclosed ailment he developed in custody. The amount was sent to an Ecobank account number 3841163630 with the name Sule Friday Onumuniya forwarded by the said policeman to Osahon’s wife’s mobile phone.
