 THESE are definitely the best of times for African clubs as World football governing body, FIFA has plans to introduce a new league into African football expected to make at least $200 million in revenue. This plan, if implemented, will be a big boost for African clubs who find it had to make ends meet with the current continental club championships that are less lucrative. This will also come as good news for Nigeria clubsides who are perpetually under financial hardship as the League would enable them earn more money if they qualify for continental championships. FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, revealed there were discussions to take African football ‘to the top of the world’ with a major stadium investment and a new ‘African League’. During his trip to Lubumbashi to celebrate the 80th anniversary of continental giants TP Mazembe, the FIFA boss spoke of his desire of the potential development. “We have to take the 20 best African clubs and put them in an Africa League,” Infantino said. “Such a league could make at least $200 million in revenue, which would put it among the top 10 in the world.” The 49-year-old added he would look to ‘collect a billion dollars’ for the purpose of offering each African country a world-class stadium up to the standards of FIFA. “We’ll take the best African referees and pay them. We will depoliticise it and professionalise African refereeing,” he said. “I want to take African football to the top of the world,” Infantino added.
