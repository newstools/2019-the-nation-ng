By Olaitan Ganiu  POPULAR  entertainers, Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa simply known Charly Boy and rapper FalztheBahdGuy, seem to be working on a track that criticizes Nigerian pastors. The  ‘Area Fada’ as Charly Boy is fondly called, posted a picture of himself with hip hop artiste , Folarin Falana popularly known as FalztheBahdGuy on his Instagram page. In the picture, Oputa and Falz were seen holding a cross, rosary and a bible with the caption: ‘Every age has its pseudo-problems created by its fake prophets and pseudo-philosophers. Fake Pastors Watch-out!’ A source however, revealed that the soon-to-be-released song is titled, ‘Fake Pastors.’  Over the years, some Nigerian pastors have come under attack with a radio presenter, Daddy Freeze, initiating Free the Sheeple Movement, criticising some pastors’ deeds. It would be recall that in 2018, Falz released a controversial song, ‘This Is Nigeria’, a cover version of American rapper Childish Gambino’s ‘This Is America.’ The song – critical of corrupt politicians, places of worship and the security forces – soon drew the anger of some institutions, such as Nigeria’s Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC). The lawyer-turned-musician also dropped a single, ‘Talk and Moral Instruction’, on his fourth album comprising nine tracks. The songs condemned politicians, corruption, police brutality, prostitution, social injustice and internet fraud.
