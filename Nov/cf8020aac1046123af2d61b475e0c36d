ANTHONY Joshua has lost none of his punching power after slimming down for his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr, according to David Haye. Derek Chisora sparred Joshua as he continues to prepare for his crucial second fight with Ruiz Jr and impressed his fellow Brit. Haye, who manages Chisora, dished on how the sparring session went and how Joshua is performing following his efforts to shed muscle. “Derek is impressed with Joshua,” he said. “He found him not just in great shape but having trimmed down to the lean muscle, which is what he needed to do if he is to keep out of danger by boxing Ruiz at long range. “And although he’s taken off the over-muscle, he’s still punching damn hard as well as being quicker on his feet.” Joshua has vowed to gain revenge over Ruiz Jr, insisting the Mexican only won their first fight because of a ‘lucky punch sent by the Gods’. Ruiz, the WBO, WBA (Super) and IBF champion, laughed off Joshua’s assessment of their first encounter in the ring and intends to shock the world for a second time in December.
