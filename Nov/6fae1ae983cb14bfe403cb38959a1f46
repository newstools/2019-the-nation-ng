Thirty-four-year-old Chineye Nwankwo, on Monday, appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly selling her one-day-old baby girl for N300,000. The alleged buyer, Happiness Bini, 49, was also arraigned, charged with unlawful adoption of a baby. The duo, whose residential addresses were not given, are facing a three-count-charge of conspiracy, child trafficking and unlawful adoption. They pleaded not guilty. Police prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on October 4, at 10pm. at No. 10 Oki Lane, Sari Iganmu, Orile, Lagos State. According to him, the duo conspired to engage in child trafficking. Ayorinde told the court that the arrest of the duo followed information that Bini was in possession of a newborn suspected to have been stolen. He said that the offences contravened Sections 269, 276 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised). The Chief Magistrate, Mrs B. O. Osunsanmi, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200,000 each with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until February 3, 2020 for substantive hearing.
