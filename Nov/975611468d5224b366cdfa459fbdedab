  NIGERIA International, Kelechi Iheanacho , has made the best use of the few appearances he has made for Leicester City this season following the nomination of his strike for the Club’s Goal of the Month Award for October. Incidentally, the former Manchester City star scored two goals from the appearances he has made for the  Foxes this season which were all  in the Carabao Cup. Iheanacho’s impressive finish in Leicester’s 3-1 Carabao Cup win over Burton Albion  as well  as other seven first team strikes and two development squad efforts were  nominated for the Club’s Goal of the Month competition after an incredible October for Leicester City. Jamie Vardy, Youri Tielemans, Ayoze Pérez and James Maddison are  also among the nominees too while development squad duo Khanya Leshabela and Josh Eppiah have also been shortlisted for the award. Supporters have until 11:59pm GMT on Sunday 10 November to enter their vote on which strike should be chosen as the best in October. James Maddison’s stunning strike against Tottenham won last month’s award. Meanwhile, Leicester City have opened discussions to sign 21-year-old Nigerian attacker Emmanuel Dennis from Belgian side Club Brugge in the January transfer window. The player is the top priority identified by the Foxes’ boss Brendan Rodgers in terms of a mid-season reinforcement. The Belgian side are likely to ask for between €20m (N8B) and €23m (N9.2B). Dennis has six goals to his name this season already and caught the eye earlier in the campaign with two against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu last month in Brugge’s famous 2-2 draw in the Champions League. Dennis is expected to replace compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho, who has failed to break into the Foxes first team under Brendan Rodgers. Since arriving from Ukrainian side Zorya Luhansk in summer 2017 for a paltry €1.3m, Dennis has contributed 25 goals and nine assists in 86 games.
