 THE Federal Government is focused on completing ongoing road projects in 2020, Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola (SAN) said on Monday. In a statement by Media Adviser Hakeem Bello, the minister clarified The Nation’s Monday lead story credited to the Senate Committee on Land Transport Chairman, Senator AbdulFatai Buhari. Fashola noted that based on the President’s mandate, the Ministry of Works and Housing presented 504 road projects under contract to the National Assembly Joint Committee. “The Minister said it was, therefore, not correct to attribute a figure of 3,300 road projects as being presented for ‘next year’s budget’.’ “The Minister said the clarification became expedient to set the records straight, especially in the face of so many unfounded statements being attributed to him. “He assured Nigerians that the government was committed to delivering good road network across the country and would remain focused on this.”
