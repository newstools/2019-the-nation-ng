Osagie Otabor, Benin Chairman-designate of the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Dr. Pius Odubu, has raised the alarm over activities of fraudsters who had opened several Facebook accounts in his name. Odubu who said he does not operate a personal Facebook account stated that the fraudsters created the Facebook accounts with the intent to dupe the unsuspecting public with claims of offering bogus contracts from the NDDC to their victims. He advised anyone caught in the scam to report to the Police to track down such individuals. A statement issued by his Personal Assistant, Dennis Osazuwa Eribo, said
any group or persons who have had any reason to do any business with a supposed Hon. Pius Odubu that the individual is not only a fake, an impostor and a scam. “His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Dr. Pius Egberanmwen Odubu does not operate any Facebook account, by himself or by anyone so authorized to carry out such function on his behalf. “It has come to the notice of Dr. Odubu that some unscrupulous persons have created several Facebook accounts with the intent to dupe the unsuspecting public with claims of offering bogus contracts from the NDDC to their victims. “I am by this disclaimer advising the general public to be weary and beware of such request as it has no origin from Dr. Odubu or from NDDC.”
