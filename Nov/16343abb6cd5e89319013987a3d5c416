 Golden Eaglets’ coach, Manu Garba, has said that Nigeria must  enhance its youth development programme in order  to do well at international competitions. The  former El Kanemi captain  and two-time winner of the FIFA U-17 World Cup  made the call In the wake of  the national U-17  shock elimination from the on-going  Brazil 2019 U-17 World Cup. On Tuesday, the Golden  Eaglets were beaten 3-1 by The Netherlands in a Round of 16 clash  at the at the Estadio Olimpico in Goiania to exit the FIFA Under 17 World Cup in Brazil. Though the result has caused  lot of uproar among football fans, Garba said the country must  learn from the mistakes in Brazil to take back its eminent position at this level . “Going forward, we have to take the positive and work on the negatives, but most importantly, we have to enhance our youth development programme with lots of tournaments both locally and internationally,” Garba exclusively told NationSport. “We also need to build more good facilities and send our coaches on seminars and refresher courses.” In an otherwise poor tournament for the record five-time FIFA U-17 World Cup winner, Garba  has singled out 17-year-old Akinkunmi Amoo for special praise, assuring that he would become a future Super Eagles if he remains discipline. “I will not mention names but Akin Amoo will be a great potential if he remains disciplined and focused,” the 54-year-old Garba noted. Meanwhile, Golden Eaglets’  Team Media Officer, Francis Achi , hinted that Amoo  was  probably the most-loved Nigerian youngster by the local fans in Brazil, adding the lad is indeed destined for greatness. “ I think we still have some positives  to take home  despite  our elimination from the Round of 16 by the Netherlands, “ Achi told NationSport. “  Brazilians love Amoo so much and he’s  regarded as our best player  and one for the future.”
