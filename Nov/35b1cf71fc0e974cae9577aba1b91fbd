Once believed to be the solution to ensuring safety of vessels while waiting on the high sea to berth in Lagos, the Secure Anchorage Area has now become a subject of dispute between its operators and the Nigeria Ports Authority. The ports’ landlord has ordered the end of SAA regime while the operators and some other stakeholders are canvassing its continuation. Should this regime continue or be aborted? MUYIWA LUCAS writes.  AS the Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) agreement between the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) and an indigenous company, Ocean Marine Solutions Limited (OMSL), a rip off? Who could have ripped who off? The SAA is believed to be a child of circumstance, created after a steering committee set up in 2013, by the Nigerian Navy, NPA, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and other agencies of government. This was because there were critical issues at that time which included illegal arms importation, piracy and robbery at sea, which gave the country’s waters a “High Risk Area” (HRA) tag by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). Those meetings led to the creation of the SAA, among other demarcations on the water, for ships who wish to anchor there while waiting to berth at the ports. Rip off? The argument of rip off has continued to resonate loudly in the aftermath of the collapse of the SAA. This is because there is a continued disagreement as to the remittance or otherwise of revenue generated from the regime. This revenue were generated from ships making use of the SAA, which were charged $2,500 for the first day and $1,500 every day for the period they stayed at the anchorage area. It is the industry belief that it takes between 28 and 30 days for a vessel to exit the anchorage. That translates to a vessel paying about$46,500.00 for making use of the SAA. From the NPA’s data on vessel traffic, 1,666 vessels call at the Lagos ports alone quarterly, while a minimum of 55 per cent of the vessels stay at the SAA. This means that an average of 916 ships stay at the anchorage quarterly or 3,665 ships in a year. Monetarily, this translates that the operators of the SAA, that is OMSL and the Nigerian Navy were collecting an average of $133.28 million (N47.98 billion) annually. These monies are said not to be remitted to the NPA nor the federal government. However, OMSL General Manager, Business Development and Government Relations, Commodore Chuma Adogu (rtd.) denies depriving the government of revenue. “That is not true; it is a misinformation. Yes NPA provided vessels for the Nigerian Navy, three in all, according to the papers, but none of those vessels is in the secure anchorage area. All the vessels that are used in the secure anchorage are owned by the OMS, donated to the Navy to man. We had a relationship with the Navy, which started in 2007, on the basis of which we acquired vessels that are domiciled with the Navy, painted in Navy colours; an outsider may not know the difference, but we know, the Navy knows. It is not true that we are using government asset to make money and the money is being directed to private pocket. It is very untrue. It is because people do not know this arrangement,” he explained. He further added: “Our relationship is for security service which NPA does not have a mandate for. Who has mandate for security? Nigerian Navy, not even NIMASA because NIMASA still refers to Nigerian Navy; and the Nigerian Navy deems it fit to collaborate with us, because they have approval from the government to do that. It is a collaboration that didn’t just start at the Secure Anchorage Area. Before now, any of these three things happens: the vessels stay outside our territorial waters, where pirates can’t reach them 200 miles away, and wait for allocation of berth; others who don’t want to stay that far, come in with mercenaries and thereby breech our security. Even that option was more costly too. Others who don’t want to get involved about that simply divert to neighboring ports; which amounts to a huge loss to the economy of Nigeria; the idea of a Secure Anchorage Area stopped all the three via payment of a small fee; and they are happy about it. Maybe the argument is in the name, perhaps, if we remove the ‘Anchorage’ there, maybe the NPA will stop laying claims to it. May be, the term ‘Anchorage’ actually precipitated the misunderstanding.” Still, another stakeholder, Samuel Egbewole, tagged the allegation as “misleading.” According to him, not only was the payments received for services rendered at prior agreed rate with clients, they were even cheaper than what the NIMASA charges. “The bogus figures being peddled around are so far away from reality and can only be a figment of imagination of the persons spinning them.  From the records I have accessed, the average number of vessels in the SAA daily was 20, with many of them departing within days. So, assuming for argument sake, that they all pay the initial $2,000 for 30 days of the month, that comes to $60,000. If this is divided by the seven patrol boats I understand OMSL operate for the 24/7 protection, the daily rate immediately plummets to $8,572 per boat. The figure is still cheaper than the $10,500 that NIMASA pays to hire boats of questionable standard for its inland waters enforcement!” the Egbewole said. “I was seriously interested in the issue when they said OMSL was busy fetching money from the Nigerian waters using Government platforms. You only need to scratch beyond the surface, to know it is not true. Government would own vessels; and one person will be operating it and be putting the money in his pocket? The platforms belonged to the OMSL, not the Navy, NPA or NIMASA or Government. And it is not in any way costing the Government anything!’ he further stated. Caution is the word The President, National association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, Increase Uche, however cautioned against a sudden dismantling of the SAA, stressing that abolishing the security of the anchorage area without a superior alternative would lead to a resurgence of maritime crimes, attract higher insurance cost of vessels coming into Lagos, and further tarnish the country’s image. Dismantling the SAA, he further argued, may also result in a new era of spiraling inflation, or subsequent diversion of cargoes to ports of neighbouring countries, especially after the current land border closure policy is sorted. Uche said: “We have seen what the industry had passed through and we do not want to go back to the old order. We do not want our cargoes to be exposed to criminals. So we are appealing to the NPA to rescind the decision to dismantle the SAA. Kayode Oyedele wondered why an issue which was generally agreed to by both the NIMASA and the NPA to enable the nation evolve a more credible layer of ‘security’ and guarantee formidable protection for foreign vessels at no cost to government or any of its agencies had suddenly become controversial. He recalled that the arrangement was introduced when piracy in the country peaked, crude production dropped and the International Oil Companies (IOCs) were threatening to pull out of the country. “The idea of a Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) was a strategic decision by the IOCs, the Nigerian Navy and other stakeholders which included the NPA and NIMASA to tackle the menace and provide a life line for Nigeria. The IOCs could not fund the Nigerian Navy. The IOCs were sufficiently threatened to consider fleeing. The Navy did not have adequate platforms or logistics to tackle the dangerous criminals. Kidnapping was soaring. Demand for ransom was getting out of hand. The nation’s image was in tatters. Relevant stakeholders were begging the IOCs not to depart Nigeria. And then, suddenly, out of the blue, the IOCs came up with the idea of a SAA! The only problem was where to find the private investors, who would be willing or adventurous enough to procure relevant vessels costing about $3m each, to hand them over to the Nigerian Navy, without any insurance cover. “But, one company called OMSL opted to take the risk. To invest about $3million in each vessel and agreed to operate it, uninsured. Many saw it as a stupid thing to do. But, I guess it is now paying off. And that explains why Nigerians, are suddenly interested in it,” he stated further. Oyedele recalled that at the advent of the SAA regime, NIMASA not only hailed the idea as a “corporate breakthrough”, but also endorsed the emergence of the OMSL –Navy accord, via an advert, highlighting that the SAA would be a ‘spherical shaped ‘ off-shore Lagos 5nm, located with a centre-point  at Longitude 06* 17’ 30’’; and Latitude 003* 12’ 00, located about 10 nautical miles southwest, before entering Nigeria, through the Fairway Buoy. The agency also in the advert, emphatically acknowledged that the SAA exists to “serve as an additional security service for provision of dedicated 24/7 watch, to vessels seeking extra protection while at anchorage offshore Lagos.” Also, he said the NPA endorsed it via an advert it placed on April 4, 2014, in a national newspaper, designating certain areas as “Lagos Ship to Ship Coordinates; NPA designated Lagos Anchorage; Secure Anchorage Area and No Anchorage Area.” Jurisdiction Yet, stakeholders maintain that the NPA lacked direct jurisdiction over the SAA matter, because the area in question is totally an offshore, 10nm, outward Fairway Buoy, hence, out of the NPA’s purview, since the NPA’s jurisdiction begins from after the Fairway Buoy. But the NPA has since maintained that its jurisdiction over the SAA is unambiguous. In a letter of response from the NPA to OMSL dated October 9, 2019, the Authority restated its jurisdiction, among other reasons, as to why the SAA is to be truncated. “One, by virtue of Port Act (1954), an Anchorage Area is an integral part of NPA statutory responsibility while NIMASA, Marine Police and Nigerian Navy to ensure a safe and secure Nigeria territorial waters. Two, the Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) (Centre Point 06 17’30N/003 12’00E) established by OMSL is located within the port limit, which should be strictly under the management and control of the NPA. “Three, it is established that vessels are directed and regulated to this facility by OMSL, who NPA does not have contractual agreement or other with. However, the Navy has a Memorandum of Understanding with OMSL and is providing security to the anchorage. Four, the continued operation of this facility by a private entity could pose security threat to the nation.” NPA further stated that the operations of SAA added up to high cost for vessels coming to Nigeria through the charge of $1,500 per vessel per day. The NPA, in its letter to the Navy, therefore said :“To this end, you are graciously requested to stop the operation of the SAA while a new framework – nearing conclusion – is being put in place to be managed by NPA in collaboration with your service and other government agencies that are critical to the operation of the anchorage. Please note that the authority will issue a notice to Mariners for the discontinuance of the SAA operation and a consequent amendment of the British Admiralty Chart-1381.” NPA ready The Managing Director of NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, is cautious that following this development, entrenched interests might fuel insecurity to fuel the campaign for the SAA to stay. Usman stated, “We have also notified the Nigerian Navy that, that arrangement cannot continue anymore, and we anticipate a pushback from the operators of these safe anchorage areas. But we are going to sustain our position that vessels should not be charged for safe anchorage area. “The Federal Government, Nigerian Navy, should provide that. And to the extent that the Nigerian Navy requires an additional support, we would provide that support. But, already, our vessels that we procured to secure that anchorage are part of the vessels that they are using to secure the safe anchorage area.” “I would like to say that any increase in insecurity in the Lagos waters, as relates to this, we are going to hold some people responsible, because once you remove, for example, a safe anchorage, they would try to intentionally create insecurity. I just needed to sound that as a point of reference. This safe anchorage has been removed, and we would work with the Nigerian Navy and NIMASA to secure the anchorage. Any attempt to create any insecurity, to justify the establishment of the safe anchorage area, would not be accepted, because our anchorage in the Lagos area has been very safe. We do not have any incidence or activities of militants in the waterways in this part,” she warned. A vote for SAA The concerned shipping and ports services users who spoke to journalists through Increase, national president of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF) said they were baffled that the NPA, which was part of a tripartite committee on maritime security, that created the SAA in 2014 is now wanting to dismantle the facility, where ships coming to Lagos ports are well secured. Increase, who leads the largest association of international trade experts in Nigeria, said it had become very necessary for the shippers and freight forwarders who use the services of the multinational shipping lines to speak up and resist the dissolution of the SAA. He said, “If we do not add our voice to clarify the facts at this point, the government may be misled and the country will be worse off as far as maritime security is concerned. We do not want this SAA to be disrupted so as not to expose our cargoes to the risk due to hijacking of ships and kidnapping of crew. If the SAA is disrupted, ships will now again, begin to go to neighboring ports of Cotonou, Togo and Ghana. We don’t want to go back to the old order. We are asking the federal government to look critically on this issue so that the SAA is not dismantled. He insisted that maintain the SAA was a far cheaper and safe way to manage security for ships coming into the country as the vessels used to carry mercenaries onboard to provide the security when coming to Nigeria at a very exorbitant cost. He explained, “Before the establishment of the SAA, vessels coming to Lagos would carry mercenaries onboard, to provide security for them. One of such mercenaries would cost $2,500 and a ship would carry three for a period not less than 30 days. That costs as much as $225,000 and even more, when the mercenaries have to be onboard for more than a month. “As freight forwarders we are major port users of shipping services, moving cargoes across seas from to Nigeria. We are comfortable with the service and we urge the Federal Government to let the SAA be so that the multinational shipping lines can continue to patronise our seaports. SAA must go For the President, Nigerian Association of Master Mariners, Capt Tajudeen Alao, the cancellation of the SAA is commendable. Alao said that NPA did the right thing to cancel the toll collection by Secured Anchorage. He advised that the money so far collected should be refunded to the affected  ships with apologies. He noted that the Nigerian Navy and theNIMASA has failed in their responsibility. According to him, ships in Nigerian waters already pay annual security levy to NIMASA for same purpose of security. He said that through the implementation of the contract, the cost of doing business at Nigerian ports has been negatively affected, and that the principle of Ease of Doing Business has been contravened. “Aside for reasons of safe passage and manoeuvring of ships and quarantine of ships , it is criminal and illegal to create an anchorage for purpose of providing security and collecting dues. In line with IMO  goal on safer shipping, cleaner ocean and secured marine environment,  it is the  responsibility of member states to put into effect, the  provisions of all conventions that have been adopted and assented to, as far as all ships under its flag to which it has jurisdiction. And compliance by  ships calling in its ports or operating offshore or  under innocent passage. Government of coastal states must provide safe waters for all ships at no extra cost. The port authority must designate certain areas for specific purposes, safe Anchorage for short or long stay , quarantine, dumping ground,  waiting for clearance,  pilot boarding , special purposes, clear of the channels and these must be so marked on the charts of each port. The Master of ships may decide safe place  to anchor outside marked areas or outside port limit , but must inform port control,” Alao submitted.
