Victor Osimhen is expected to pay a key role as LOSC Lille tries to revive their faltering UEFA Champions League campaign in Valencia tonight. Lille are bottom of Group H with only a point and a loss at the Estadio Mestalla will end the French side’s chances of reaching the knock out stages. Osimhen started on the bench in Lille’s loss to Marseille on Saturday and his presence was missed as the team were unable to find their depth. His entry late in the game brought in confidence for the away side and changed the face of the game with Lille getting some bite in attack. The 20-year-old has been involved in 10 of Lille’s 20 goals these season in all competitions with eight goals and two assists but he hasn’t scored in four games since his strike against Nimes on October 6. Meanwhile, Peter Olayinka would look to bounce back after he scored an own goal as Slavia Prague fell to a 2-1 loss against Barcelona two weeks ago. Barcelona host Slavia Prague at the Nou Camp and the Czech champions are bottom of Group F after picking up just a point from three games. Olayinka deflected a Luis Suarez shot with his chest in the 57th minute and the 23-year-old was the most dispossessed player in Jindich Trpisovsky’s team and one of the players who completed the fewest passes. Olayinka was on the pitch for 73 mins for Slavia Prague in their 4-0 Fortuna Liga victory over Banik Ostrava on Saturday. Paul Onuachu and Stephen Odey’s Genk will face red-hot English giants at Anfield also tonight. Odey, formerly of MFM FC, scored in his Champions League debut in the reverse fixture two weeks ago.
