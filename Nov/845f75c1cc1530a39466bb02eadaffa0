 Residents of four communities in Ajowa,Ikaram Erusu and Arigidi Akoko in Akoko Northwest local government area of Ondo state have cried out to government and the appropriate agencies to  bail them out of the abandoned Ajowa-Ikare road project. The road project was awarded seven years ago by former Governor Olusegun Mimiko. The construction firm started from Ikare end and stopped work after two kilometres at Agbaluku Arigidi-Akoko. The contractors later went to Ajowa to do more work to Ikaram leaving a two kilometres  between Agbaluku and Imo Arigidi since then. Efforts to speak with the officials of the construction firm proved abortive. Their office at Ajowa-Akoko was deserted except few security guards. Speaking on the development, an Ikaran-Akoko community leader, Alhaj Basiru Aminu said failure to complete the road has been a cog in the wheel of progress socially and economically. Aminu said all vehicles passing through the road to the northern parts of the country now face a lot of hurdles. The regent of Akunu-Akoko, Princess Olayinka Orogun pointed out that the road was a vital link to Akunu,Ikakumo and the Northern States. She urged the state government to make sure that contractors handling road projects in Akokoland are mobilized to allow them back to the site, now that dry season is setting in.
