 FOR the second time in his fifth appearance at the ITTF World Cup, Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri waltzed his way into the knockout stage of this year’s tournament holding in Chengdu, China. Despite coming into the competition as a replacement for Hong Kong’s Wong Chun Ting, Quadri gave a good account of himself despite arriving few hours to his first match. In the first group game, Quadri stunned Australia’s Heming Hu as he won in straight set of 11-6, 11-7, 11-4, 11-6 (4-0). Despite Hu’s best efforts, he had no answer to Quadri’s fast-paced game. However, in the second match against Sweden’s Kristian Karlsson, the Nigerian could not contain the rampaging Swede as the European star ran away with a 4-0 win. However, Quadri was pleased with his qualification to the next round where he will face Japanese superstar Tomokazu Harimoto today. A satisfied Quadri described his qualification as a good outing for him in China having arrived from his base in Portugal few minutes to his first match against the Australian. “I won the first match at 4-0, it might seem easy but it was not because I was injured and I have not been practicing for 10 days and only started coming back three days ago,” said Quadri.
