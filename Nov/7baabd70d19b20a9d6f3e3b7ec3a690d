Will Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole reconcile before next year’s election? Deputy Editor EMMANUEL OLADESU examines the politics of second term in the Southsouth state.  GODWIN Obaseki, governor of Edo State, and Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progeessives Congress (APC), may be walking through a tight rope. Eyes are on them and the heterogeneous state, which is contending with the protracted intra-party crisis in the ruling party. The camp of the governor appears confident as Obaseki faces next year’s poll. Personally, Obaseki is bubbling with hope, the elixir of life. The forces against him are formidable. But, he is determined to weather the storm. The governor is now crossing the bridge from the boardroom to practical politics and statecraft. There are thorns and landmines on the way. Will he survive and get a second term? He said he will overcome because he enjoys the support of the people. A cloud of uncertainty is hovering over the once united party, amid the battle of supremacy. The die is cast between Obaseki and APC National Chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Both leaders are talking tough. Also, their followers are fueling the rift and deep seated hostility. The threat to Edo APC consists less in the plot of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) to bounce back than the inexplicable predecessor-successor crisis. Obaseki is complaining that he is being sidelined in matters relating to federal appointments. Edo indigenes are being considered by the Federal Government’s posts without his knowledge, consultation and input. He said the former governor was responsible. But, the camp of Oshiomhole also complained that the governor has not carried them along, stressing that the opportunities they enjoyed under the comrade-governor have ceased. Three years ago, nobody could come between Comrade Oshiomhole and Obaseki, who was highly critical to his succession agenda as two term governor. Oshiomhole, a veteran labour leader, nursed a populist agenda. Many believed that while in the saddle he was a politician with mass following. In contrast, Obaseki was s quiet achiever; a successful technocrat who added value to the Oshiomhole administration as Leader of the Economic Team. The former governor called the shots. He was indomitable while in power. Following a hectic primary, his anointed candidate, Obaseki, emerged as the flag bearer. The flag bearer also defeated his rival, Pastor Osagie Eze-Iyamu, during the governorship poll. However, two and half years after, a curious gulf developed between the predecessor and successor. According to observers, the bone of contention is style. Oshiomhole alleged that Obaseki has not been carrying other party leaders along. He said the projects he left behind were being abandoned by his successor. Judging by his body language,  Obaseki may not be in his calculation as the APC warms up for next year’s primary. But, to Obaseki, Oshiomhole is playing playing god. His priority is to maintain a break from the past by reducing political expenditure, or stomach expenditure for few party stalwarts, and focus more on people-oriented developmental projects for the benefit of the generality of the people. Emphasising this paradigm shift, he told reporters in Benin City, the state capital, that the goal of certain politicians in Edo are at variance with the priorities of the common man. Trouble had started, shortly after the House of Assembly elections. The ruling party cleared all the 24 seats. Yet, the Assembly was enveloped in crisis of inauguration. Obaseki and Oshiomhole had parted ways and the struggle for the control of the legislative arm begun. To safeguard his career, the governor put on his thinking cap. At the end of the struggle, his men emerged as principal officers. Lawmakers loyal to Oshiomhole kicked, saying that the proclamation by the governor was improperly done. The battle shifted to court, which ruled that Obaseki was right. Both parties have now returned to the Appeal Court. Oshiomhole has been blaming Obaseki for the conflict. But, the governor objected, accusing the governor of high handedness. The governor said there would be no room for any form of godfatherism in Edo State. He also said he has the backing of the people for his transformational agenda in the Southsouth state. Obaseki said he would refuse to be intimidated by anybody, adding that the APC national chairman had outlawed godfatherism in the state. The governor said Oshiomhole, who waged anti-godfatherism war against the late Chief Tony Anenih, cannot replace him as a godfather. To observers, the crisis may divert the governor’s attention, if it continues to fester. Although some members of the Oshiomhole camp are dispute Obaseki’s achievements,  the governor has continued to be applauded by the masses. Civil servants are praising Obaseki for the reforms in the civil service. Apart from regular payment of salaries, the governor is building a new secretariat for workers. The workers have been managing the old secretariat built by former Military Governor Samuel Ogbemudia almost 50 years ago. A new quarter is also being built for judges. “Reforms in Edo includes the provision of conducive environment for civil servants to work. We want to serve the people, instead of sharing money to politicians,” said Crusoe Osagie, the governor’s media and communications adviser. Beneficiaries of services rendered by the Edo Geographic Information Service are also happy. The agency has curtailed the activities of land grabbers. Today, Certificates of Occupancy (C of O) can be processed and obtained between 30 and 45 days. Edo public primary and secondary schools are being given a face lift. At Emotan Primary School, Benin, reporters witnessed improved learning environment, with computerised teaching. For youths outside school, there is free computer training. Many roads are being constructed. Agriculture is receiving a boost. The recent Aroghodaro Summit further exposed the state’s potentials to investors. It has served as a platform for reengineering governance. Obaseki said his desire is to make a mark, and not to satisfy certain chieftains to the detriment of the masses. Politicians are asking for money, unmindful of the needs of the ordinary people that should be met by government, he said. “Politicians are being taken care of. But, when I give out contracts to them, I make sure they do the work,” Obaseki added. The governor said there is much work to do in Edo. He lamented that, due to lack of succour and guidance, many youths indulge in vices. No fewer than 40, 000 youths of Edo origin are planning to migrate abroad for real or imagined greener pastures because home is boring. The governor said no responsible government will close its eyes to that reality. In his view, Oshiomhole ought to support his push for good governance, instead of throwing obstacles on his path. Reflecting on the Assembly crisis, he lamented that the APC national chairman is not allowing the lawmakers-elect to show up for inauguration. He ruled out unimaginable tension in the state, saying: The guys making trouble in Edo are not more than two dozens.” Firing salvos at Oshiomhole, Obaseki said: “Why should a father be fighting his own children? Why should APC in Edo create an opposition within its family? The man who is to protect the family is trying to scatter the family.” The governor lamented the dimension the crisis had taken. But, he said: ”Something needs to get worse before it gets better.” Obaseki said he had no plan to dump the APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), stressing that nobody can force him out of the ruling party. Describing himself as the state party leader, he said he was firmly in control of the chapter. He said he had the support of the people to forge ahead in the implementation of his policies and programmes. On his second term ambition, he said he will earn a fresh mandate from the people next year through his laudable achievements. Obaseki said at the Alaghodaro 2019 Summit held in Benin to celebrate his third year in office that he will be re-elected. He said: “In spite of the very difficult and uncertain political environment in which we have operated in the last one year, we are grateful to God that we are able to achieve all these successes recorded, particularly engendering hope in the youths and people of Edo State by showing them pathways to fulfilling and successful lives. “Next year is an election year in Edo State. Despite the anxieties associated with the forthcoming elections, I want to assure you, our partners and other would-be investors, that because of the foundational and fundamental reforms, which we have undertaken that are very popular with our people, the chances of continuity of these policies and programmes are very high. We therefore encourage you to continue with your various investment programs.” The governor continued: “In the last three years, we have been guided and governed by certain key values and tenets such as accountability, transparency, and probity in the conduct of state matters. This may not have gone well with few actors in our society. Today we can boldly tell you that when we came to office, the total revenues by all local governments in the state was N31 million monthly, but as at October 2019, we stood at a monthly revenue of N205 million. We are not there yet because there is still room for improvements. We will continue to grow. “After three years in office, we have established credibility, not only with our civil servants, retirees, and contractors, but we have continued to promote reliability in the flow of services and commercial transactions. This is the basic minimum expectation that we have set for ourselves so that we can build on the fundamental reforms, which we embarked upon to transform Edo into a predominantly private sector driven economy, capable of creating jobs, improving the quality of lives and reducing insecurity.” Obaseki said he was not aware of moves by the PDP chieftain, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to defect to the APC. He said he has not been contacted by Exe-Iyamu, adding that there are processes for joining the ruling party. Osagie, his media aide, said there was no iota of truth in the report that the governor was planning to dump the APC. He said the governor was firmly in charge of the party structures in the state. Osagie said: “I have said it repeatedly that Governor Godwin Obaseki is firmly in charge of the structures of the APC in the state. “Whatever rumours out there that the governor is leaving the party is completely false. You don’t leave a house that you built and you are in control of. “As far as we are concerned, nobody can force Governor Obaseki out of the APC. He is firmly in control of the party. “Of course, we are aware people are saying different things but as we speak today, the structure of the APC in Edo State is firmly under the control of Governor Godwin Obaseki. “Don’t forget that few days ago, all the leaders of the APC in Edo State from across the 18 local government areas all came together and passed a vote of confidence on the governor. “They even adopted him as their candidate to fly the flag of the party in next year’s governorship election in the state. “What further endorsement can any governor be looking for at the party level ahead of a governorship election that will take place less than a year from now? He added: “I repeat, nobody can force Governor Obaseki out of the APC. The party is firmly under his control. So, the talk that he will leave the party does not arise at all. “All leaders and supporters of APC in Edo State are proud of his achievements and they are solidly behind him.” The governor also warned some APC members in the state who were creating a parallel group under the aegis of Edo People Movement (EPM), saying the constitution of APC did not support parallel bodies. “There are a few bad eggs in the party who now have another name for themselves. However, in the constitution of the APC, there is no provision for a pressure group within the party. “So, these people who have alienated themselves from the party are very minute in number and they don’t in anyway represent the voice of the larger majority of the party members, who are solidly behind the governor.”
