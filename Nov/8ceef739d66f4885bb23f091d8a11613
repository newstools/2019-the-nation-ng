By Olaitan Ganiu NOLLYWOOD actress, Tonto Dikeh whose relationship with Olakunle Churchill hit the rock years ago, seems to have turned to a marriage counselor. The multi-talented actress, in series of posts on her Instagram handle, educates the girl-child on sex. “Anytime you have sex with a person you bond with them,” she stated. “Sister, after engaging in a sexual, it can mysteriously have you longing for a person you may not even like. Stop giving away so many pieces of you to men who are already broken.” Dikeh further said that sex is more than fun. It is an emotional bond that could bring a demonic spirit. She said: “Two people may decide to have sex just for the fun of it, yet something is occurring on another level. Soul ties are real. If you’re having casual sex with a few partners or even just one and claim you’re doing it with no strings attached, you’re setting yourself up for failure.  The mother of one, however, offered that women often get hurt the most when a casual affair ends. According to reports have it that her estranged husband, Dikeh has found love in the bosom of a white woman. “Why do you think it’s so hard to let go of a partner whose hurt, disrespected and maybe abused you? Don’t allow some men to transfer negative energy into your life. “Sister, does he like you? Does he know you, do you know him? How long until he stops calling if the sex stops? No matter how tough you are, a piece of him still lies in you, even when you’re through. You could be having soul ties. Sister, you’ve got to work on you before God sends a man deserving and worthy of you.” Churchill was married to Tonto Dikeh in 2015 and divorced her in 2017. The marriage produced a child-Andre Omodayo Churchill.
