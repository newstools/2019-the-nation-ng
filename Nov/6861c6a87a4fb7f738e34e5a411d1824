There was shock among the beneficiaries of the free medical outreach organized by Bishop Sam Zuga in Adamawa state recently after a retired soldier got healed of his ten years spinal cord injury. It was gathered that the retired officer was also a beneficiary of the Sam Zuga free medical treatment. Upon receiving his healing, the middle aged former military man testified during one of the free Medical treatment in Adamawa state. Responding to the testimony of the retired soldier, Bishop Sam Zuga said: “What injection cannot do, anointing can do. What chemistry cannot handle, God-mystery can handle. What physical eyes cannot locate, spiritual eyes can locate. I return all the glory to God Almighty”  This is coming shortly after the popular bishop recently gifted brand new SUV to the King of Ejule land in Kogi State, Alhaji Abdullahi Amanbo.
