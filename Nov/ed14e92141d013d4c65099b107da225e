 THE Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Friday said it had received reports of overwhelming compliance of her members nationwide with the directive not to enroll in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). The Union says there is clear evidence that the union is winning the struggle against lawless government and autocratic leadership of the country. The Chairman, University of Ibadan Chapter of the Union, Prof Deji Omole, in a release, thanked members for standing on principle to salvage public education and secure the future of Nigeria for the children of the masses. According to the ASUU boss, Nigeria’s problems are not about payroll but failure of leadership at state and national levels. ASUU says its refusal to enroll on the IPPIS is meant to protect the rule of law, sanctity of the university system and ensure the education system gets its due. “Information reaching the leadership of ASUU UI reveals that the level of compliance to the directive of the union against IPPIS forceful enrolment is overwhelming nationwide. “There is clear evidence that we are winning the struggle as our support base in the various congresses remains solid. “By the resolution of our union, no member of the union is allowed to enlist in the IPPIS platform. “Nigeria’s problem is not about payroll but failure of leadership both at national and state levels, and the desperation of the ruling class to enslave everyone on behalf of foreign economic interests. “United we bargain, divided we beg. The people united can never be defeated. Dare to struggle, dare to win. Solidarity forever,” he stated.
