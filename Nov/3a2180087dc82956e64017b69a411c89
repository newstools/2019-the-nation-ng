 OYO State Governor Seyi Makinde on Wednesday inaugurated a five-man committee on the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso. Headed by Prof Ayodeji Omoleto, the committee will work out modalities for the joint ownership termination. Former Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory Mrs Jumoke Akinjide, Chief Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN), Oyo Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Prof Oyelowo Oyewo and his Education counterpart, Prof Dawud Sangodoyin are the other members. LAUTECH, jointly owned by Oyo and Osun states, was originally established on April 23, 1990, as Oyo State University of Technology. The creation of Osun from Oyo State in August 1991 led to the change of the institutionâ€™s name to Ladoke University of Technology, with the two states having joint ownership. However, the funding and management of the institution, which has two campuses: one in Ogbomoso, Oyo State and the other in Osogbo, Osun, has been a major challenge, leading to irregular payment of subventions and unpaid salaries. The situation had, in 2017, degenerated into a major crisis, resulting in protracted industrial action by the workers and eventual closure of the institution, which had only recently reopened. Speaking at the inauguration, Makinde directed the committee to come up with a preliminary report within four weeks. He said Oyo bore no grudge against Osun over the institution, but noted that it was obvious that the joint ownership could no longer work. He said it would be unfair to allow the students, the lecturers, management and business concerns linked to the university to continue to suffer.
