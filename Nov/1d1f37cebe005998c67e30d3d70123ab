Traffic on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway will be diverted from the major carriageway to the service lane Saturday and Sunday, the Lagos State Government announced on Friday. The affected area, according to the Special Adviser on Works and Infrastructure to the governor, Aramide Adeyoye, is Segment II of Lot 2A (Agboju–Trade Fair) inward Badagry only. Lagos bound traffic is not affected. She explained that the diversion is to enable the contractors working on the road  launch beams at the Alakija Interchange Bridge. Adeyoye appealed to motorists and road users to bear with the government. She said: “Palliative works have been carried out on the bad sections of the road such as the intersections into the service lane before Alakija flyover, the junction between the access road into FESTAC at the 3rd gate and the intersection after the Alakija interchange into the main carriage lane from the service lane.” She said that the repair was to effectively manage traffic and reduce the impact of the diversion on road users. Adeyoye appealed to commuters to obey the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officials and follow directional signs to aid their movements to ensure free flow of traffic.
