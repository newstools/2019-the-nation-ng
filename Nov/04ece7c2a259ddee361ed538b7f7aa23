Automobile dealers under the aegis of Automobile Dealers Friends Association on Monday protested the sealing of their businesses by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) as a result of a crackdown on cars suspected to have been smuggled through the land borders. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that over 100 protesting members of the Association had from 10: am walked from Awolowo Road Ikeja to the State House of Assembly. The protesters stopped at the office of the Federal Operations Unit of the NCS at Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Ikeja lamenting the crackdown which began on September 30. The protesters carried placards with various inscriptions such as “Customs we are not smiling, we are tired since September 30, 2019,” “Enough of the injustice, unseal our shops,” “Customs, come and take the smuggled vehicles you collected duty on.” At the NCS office, Mr Morgan Ogbede, the Chairman of the Association and other executives engaged in a closed-door meeting with Mr Mohammed Aliyu, the Comptroller, Federal Operations Unit Zone A and other officials of the NCS. Ogbede also said that the Association still intended to file a suit in court demanding compensation for the various losses its members had suffered as a result of the closure of their shops two months ago.
