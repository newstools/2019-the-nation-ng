 THE Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has thrown its weight behind the Federal Government for closing the national borders. The commendation was made by the National President of NACCIMA, Hajiya Saratu Aliyu, who spoke to The Nation over the weekend, adding that it was a step in the right direction. Aliyu lamented that Nigerian neighbours had taken the country for granted for too long, adding that the neighboring countries have grossly violated trade agreements of ECOWAS. She noted that without such action being taken and enforced by the government, there is no way influx of substandard products into the country can be successfully curbed. “Firstly, I want to commend the government for the step it took concerning the closure of the boarder. Our neighbours are taking us for granted. There have been the ECOWAS treaty, which they signed and affirmed to abide by, unfortunately, they swept it under the carpet and were turned the country into a dumping ground. The closure of the boarder also adversely affected our members, but we are happy to know that the government has made its point known and a new date has now been fixed for reopening of the boarder. I want to appeal to our members to be patient because the government is fighting our course.” The NACCIMA boss expressed that this action is not a threat to the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTA), explaining that there are rules guiding the trade treaty.
