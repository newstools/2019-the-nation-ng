 THE Oba of Odi-Olowo in Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye Local Council Development Area of Lagos, Oba Fatai Adisa Irawo-Ogunsi, has passed on. He died on Wednesday at 82. The late traditional ruler mounted the stool in 2000 when his installation took place at the Shokunbi/Coker Junction in Odi-Olowo, believed to be the exact place where the monarch’s ancestors first settled in the 15th Century. Chairman of Mushin Local Government Emmanuel Bamigboye described the late monarch as a nice man who had a good working relationship with government agencies. “He was nice to the people, loveable and understanding. The community will miss him. The vacuum will be difficult to fill,” Bamigboye said.
