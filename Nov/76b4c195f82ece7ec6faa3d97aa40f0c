TOTTENHAM boss Jose Mourinho says he cannot imagine the prospect of managing another club, refusing to say whether he would have been interested in the Arsenal job, which became available yesterday. The Portuguese was named as Spurs boss last week following Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking and has started in style, winning his first two games in charge. He had been linked with a move to Arsenal, who sacked Unai Emery, before the Spurs job came up, but chose not to say whether he would have been interested in the role had he still been out of work. “No point to tell it,” he said of the Arsenal link. “Didn’t happen. Happened now. “I’m so happy here that I couldn’t even think about the possibility to go to another place. You can put now in front of me any club in the world, I would not move.” On Emery’s sacking, Mourinho added: “It’s always sad news. I felt it as a kid when my dad was sacked as a manager, I felt it myself when I have been sacked previously. “There’s not one single manager sacked that I’m happy with. I always feel a deja vu situation. So I’m sad for it but that’s life.” Spurs could make it three wins from three under Mourinho when they host Bournemouth today.
