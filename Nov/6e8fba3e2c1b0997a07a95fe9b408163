 THE Lagos State Government will be closing down Yaba and Jibowu/Ogunmorin axis on November 16 and 23 from 8pm to 6am the next day for the level cross construction of the rail tracks. On November 16, the Jibowu axis will be closed down, while the Yaba axis of the rail will be shut down on November 23. The routes will be closed at night to ensure smooth and uninterrupted flow of work on the rail tracks. The routes will also be used interchangeably as alternative routes for motorists to get to their various destinations so that when one axis is under construction, the other axis will be opened for motorists. The Lagos State Government appealed to road users to bear with the government as it takes steps to create proper road infrastructure that will ultimately improve the traffic situation of the state.
