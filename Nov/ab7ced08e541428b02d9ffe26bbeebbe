By Moses Emorinken, Abuja Rotary Club of Abuja Capital Territory District 9125 has offered free medical services to members of the Sabon Lugbe community in Abuja. The intervention was part of Rotary International’s effort to ensure Nigerians get unhindered access to treatment and quality health services for HIV, diabetes, hepatitis, eye infections, malaria, and others, considering that Nigeria is among the heavily burdened countries with some of these diseases. President of Rotary Club of Abuja Capital Territory District 9125, Mrs. Ndidi Uchuno, explained: “The exercise will afford members of the community the opportunity to get screened for various diseases and get treatment free of charge. “Also, those who cannot be treated on the spot would get referrals to competent health facilities in the country. We will also educate the people about family planning, water sanitation and hygiene, and the WASH programme. “We have begun the first of three stages of hepatitis vaccination. There is also eye screening and we have provided glasses for those who need them. We also have experts in the family department to encourage couples on the need to go for the type of family planning method that best suits them”. According to the Director of the Rotarians for Family Health and Aids Prevention Programme West Africa, Mr. Olugbemiga Oluwo, “the yearly programme which began in 2012 has reached about 1.8 million people in Africa, with the largest population reached in Nigeria. People have confessed to us that their health have become better through this programme”. He further said that the organisation will continue to work hard to scale up the number until every community has free access to qualitative healthcare services. Beneficiaries of the free medical programme by Rotary Club lauded the initiative and encouraged the organisers to keep the programme running because of the resultant health benefits it has on their wellbeing both individually and as a communities.
