A dispute between the Agriculture and Allied Employees Union of Nigeria (AAEUN) and the Agriculture and Allied Workers Union (AAWUN) is yet to be resolved, it was learnt on Wednesday. The Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had urged the two factions to settle their differences. Director of Trade Union Services and Industrial Relations Department, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mrs O.U. Akpan, in a January 31 letter on behalf of the Minister Dr Chris Ngige, said AAEUN and AAWUN were not recognised. The ministry, therefore, withdrew a certificate earlier issued to AAEUN and directed the factions to come up with a unified name. Based on the directive, the NLC called a peace meeting of all stakeholders in the agriculture trade union movement. It was resolved that a new name be created for the two unions; and that a transition committee of 33 members be set up to run its affairs for six months before an election. It was also agreed that a constitution be produced by the committee. After the agreement, the parties came up with a name: Nigeria Union of Agriculture and Allied Employees (NUAAE). The name was registered by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment on May 23 and issued with registration number 0112, in accordance with the Trade Unions Act, 2004. The transition committee, now in its seventh month, is yet to constitute the state committees and conduct an election due to power-sharing disagreements. AAWUN members of the committee, it was learnt, are accusing their opponents in the AAEUN of not complying with the agreement and of refusing to shift grounds, but the AAEUN is denying the allegations. Stakeholders have appealed to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment and NLC to intervene once again towards the peaceful resolution of the issues to enhance harmonious industrial relations in the agriculture sector
