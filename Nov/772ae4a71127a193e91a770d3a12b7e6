 No fewer than 15 school pupils were on Monday teargassed by officials of the Lagos State Environmental Taskforce along Agboyi Road, Alapere. There were allegations that some of the pupils also sustained gunshot injuries while fleeing from a fracas between taskforce officials and motorcycle operators. Trouble was said to have started in the morning after the task force officials stormed the area to prevent aggrieved motorcyclists protesting against their leadership. The Nation gathered that violence broke out after some boys wielding bottles and cutlasses who came with the police allegedly started impounding motorcycles. It was learnt that the protesters resisted the move by the officials and their ‘thugs’ which lead to sporadic gunshots and pelting of stones, bottles from both sides. Video footage of the incident posted on social media showed the taskforce officials carrying one of the injured pupils, while their patrol vehicle blared its sirens. According to sources, many residents were physically assaulted and sustained injuries while shops were looted by hoodlums. They also accused the Taskforce of arresting innocent people and looting properties. A man, who posted information about the incident, said the pupils were of Agidi Comprehensive High School, adding that they were hospitalised as a result of the teargas. “The policemen were shooting to scare residents while thugs were asking people to go inside. This did not only create panic around the neigbourhood but also caused loss of property. “Policemen came with thugs armed with cutlasses and crates of bottles which they carted away from shops. “The attack by the security men especially by the armed ‘thugs’ in their midst caused panic.
