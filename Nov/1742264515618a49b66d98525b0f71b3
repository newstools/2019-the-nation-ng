The Comptroller General of the Nigerian Correctional Service Ja’afaru Ahmed on Monday said 95 inmates who escaped from the Koton Karfe Medium Custodian Centre were yet to be apprehended. He promised, though, that security operatives have stepped up efforts to bring the escapee inmates back. Ahmed made the remarks shortly after declaring open the 2019 edition of a Special Mediation Accreditation and Certification Course organised by Prisons’ Officers Wives Association in collaboration with the Institute of Chartered Mediators and Conciliators (ICMC) for Prisons’ Officers and their spouses. He said the Service had set the ball rolling on the reforms contained in the Nigerian Correctional Service Act 2019, stressing that in the shortest time possible, the 221 formations across the country would witness significant changes.
