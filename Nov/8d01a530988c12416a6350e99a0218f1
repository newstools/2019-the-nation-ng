 A PEOPLES Democratic Party (PDP) Bayelsa youth group on Sunday accused the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of recruiting bandits to cause mayhem and rig the November 16 governorship election in the state. The group, under the aegis of the PDP South South Youth Vanguard, called on security agencies to ensure that no group or individuals are allowed to foment trouble during the election. In a statement signed by its Chairman, James Efe Akpofure, the vanguard said any group planning such violence could not be said to have the interest of the people at heart. The group further warned instigators of the alleged violence to be mindful of their actions, stating that their attempt to destroy the state’s oil resources would be resisted by the people of Bayelsa. The PDP youths alleged that the objective of the instigators was to capture the oil-rich state through electoral violence and intimidation during the poll, just as they did during the governorship election in Rivers State. The statement further said that the Bayelsa people were wiser now and that they would resist the antics of the APC in whatever guise. Vowing to match the alleged bandits force with force, the PDP youth group cautioned those intending to sponsor violence during the election to be ready to face the consequences of their action. The statement said: “We are ready to face anything the APC wants to introduce during the election. Bayelsa is PDP state and we are not going to fold our arms and watch them take away what belongs to us. “We know their plans and we are ready to counter them. We are prepared for election and if they are not ready, they should tell INEC to declare PDP as the winner of the election.”
