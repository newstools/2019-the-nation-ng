By Akpan Sunday  Fast rising singer and entertainer Ibironke Kazeem, known as ‘Runny Kay’, has said one of the challenges she has faced as an upcoming artiste is funding. She said top celebrities still face challenges, let alone rising stars. Runny Kay described cash as the first because many ‘people would not want to pay you since you are not yet a star like they call them.’ The singer, who spoke with The Nation, said: “They ignore the fact that you are coming to entertain their… guests, they would see it as helping you, and we have to dress nice, look good, because there is this popular quote that says you can only attract your type, so if you dress untidy, who are you going to attract? Just your type too.” She also noted that bloggers were not helping in terms of publicity and fees charged.  ‘Another challenge we face are from bloggers, some of them charge us too much for promotions, forgetting we are yet to earn money.’ Speaking on the state of the music industry, the Afro Hip Hop singer and skin specialist said the industry was doing well and the music industry one of the best locally and internationally. “I will say it’s a very good industry, I mean it’s doing very well and I’m also amazed at the rate at which it’s growing/improving. ‘’As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best industry in Nigeria among others when we talk about international standards, you can tell from our music videos,’’ she said.
