Federal Capital Territory Football Association (FCT FA) chairman, Mohammed Adam Mouktar, has commended  the brains behind the wave-making Belgian football movie, SIDELINE. SIDELINE is a documentary on the lives of young African (mainly Nigerian) footballers who troop yearly to Europe in pursuit of their dreams. Over the weekend, The Ambassador of Belgium to Nigeria H. E Daniel Dargent in Abuja hosted the screening of the Belgian Movie to a selected audience that included the FCTFA chairman, the Chairperson of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Honourable  Dabiri-Erewa  as well as former Super Eagles goalkeeper and captain Peter Rufai  who featured for both  Lokeren and Beveren in the Belgian League during his heyday. “This (SIDELINE) is a very laudable initiative as it goes a long way in educating young aspiring footballers about the realities of embarking on a football journey to Europe and it’s challenges,” said Mouktar who was at the event with 10 aspiring young footballers from the FCT.“ As always a movie documentary is an apt way to get the message across in a sublime way. “It will sure go a long way in impacting on their thought process and they will spread the word! We need more such going forward in curbing the menace of human trafficking and exploitation,” he added. Other dignitaries that attended the event were Ambassadors, Diplomats, NGOs, International organizations, Government departments and general public working in the area of Migration and Human traffic as well as Louis Pons – one of the movie directors.
