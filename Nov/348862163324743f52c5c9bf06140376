By Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi  ACTRESS/producer Toyin Abraham has called on Nigerians to ignore negative people. Toyin, who recently launched her herbal products, noted that critics were no longer appreciated because most of them do it for fun and not to add value to people. “We can’t always control the people or circumstances in our lives. But we can always change our reactions towards them. Even at your best, someone will always have something negative to say,” she said. “Critics have become absurd just because people now do it for fun. And most of them try to expose what’s wrong about you because they can’t handle what’s right about you. “Forgetting everybody is fighting their own unique war. Just focus on who you are and don’t entertain any negativity directed at you by others. People have a right to their opinion and you have a right to ignore it. ‘’Accept criticism if you think it’s reasonable, as it takes both sun and rain for a flower to grow. However, do not get distracted by the criticism of people who don’t know how to cook but tells you your food needs salt,” she urged. She urged Nigerians to refuse to ‘open your mind to other people’s trash. When people throw stones at you, it’s because you’re loaded with fruits. So, throw them your fruits so the seeds of yourself may inspire them to change their ways. The less you respond to negative people, the more peaceful your life will become. Ignore negativity till they fade away!’ Toyin, who is married to Kolawole Adeyemi, began acting in 2003.
