A human resource outsourcing firm, Whyte Cleon Limited, has exonerated First BanK Plc of violation of labour laws. The National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institution Employee (NUBIFIE) last week accused the bank of planning to sack about 1,000 employees without following the due process. Managing Director of the firm, Mrs. Nireti Abebayo, said: “That is not true. I am just hearing it for the first time. I am not aware of any meeting from the Labour Ministry and unions. No letter was written to us.”
