By Sunday Oguntola, Online Editor It happened recently in Benue. Governor Samuel Ortom, sensing he won’t be able to outmuscle Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, George Akume, left the then ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). Ortom, who later won his re-election bid under the platform of PDP, claimed he was given a “red card” by Akume and his foot soldiers. He had the last laugh though despite being the recipient of the proverbial ‘red card’. The same scenario could play out in Edo State where Governor Godwin Obaseki is having a running battle with his god father and National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole over his re-election bid. It is almost certain both gladiators have reached a point of no-return in the battle. Except they reconcile, which is not impossible considering politics remains a dynamic game, Obaseki and Oshiomhole may go for a broke. If that happens, who issues the proverbial ‘red card’? In other words, who leaves the party for whom? This is because it is becoming clearer both men cannot remain in APC if they don’t make up. Will Oshiomhole, who appears to have the upper hands, issue his estranged godson the ‘red card’? Can he ensure Obaseki does not win the party’s governorship ticket? As national chairman, it is certain Oshiomhole cannot leave the party for Obaseki. He is believed to have the grassroots while Obaseki retains the party structure in Edo. But for how long will the Governor hang on considering the commitment and loyalty of his inner circles remain doubtful? Or, will he be given the Ambode treatment where party members, even cabinet members, moved against the incumbent’s bid to secure a second time ticket? Except Oshiomhole and Obaseki reconcile certainly the flying proverbial ‘red card’ in Edo will get used. Who gets it will become obvious in the coming days and months.
