The Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule has reiterated his government’s readiness to key into the One Local Government One Product (OLOP) initiative of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN). He made this known while receiving SMEDAN Director-General Dr. Dikko Umaru Radda in his office in Lafia. He said as the chief executive of the young state, he would do whatever he can to improve the lot of the people, adding that with a programme like OLOP, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the state would benefit from it. “I am very grateful and I want to inform you that I am very much interested in the OLOP programme, am ready to key into this, and I want MSME’s in the state to benefit from it,” Sule said. Earlier, Radda told the governor that they were in the state to assist in capacity building for MSMEs, which could only be achieved through a robust collaboration.  Radda said based on the National Survey of MSMEs, released this year, Nasarawa State has 385,489 MSMEs. He said from the survey,  micro enterprises constituted about 99.8 per cent of the MSMEs in Nigeria and that roughly 90 per cent are in the informal sector. He further hinted the governor on the objectives of the OLOP and the Conditional Grant Scheme (CGS) initiatives of the agency. He urged the governor to facilitate the inauguration of the state MSME council. He said if established, the council would be responsible for plans for MSMEs growth.
