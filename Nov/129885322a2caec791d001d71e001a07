Sanni Onogu Senator Ibrahim Danbaba was on Tuesday sworn-in to represent Sokoto South by the Clerk to the Senate, Mr. Nelson Ayewoh. Dambaba of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), replaced Senator Shehu Abubakar Tambuwal, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) whose election was recently voided by the Court of Appeal. The swearing-in of Dambaba brings the number of PDP Senators in the 9th Senate to 45, while the number of APC Senators is now 62 and the Young Progressives Party (YPP) with one Senator. It could be recalled that the election of Senator Dino Melaye representing Kogi West was recently nullified by the Court of Appeal which ordered a bye-election. Election into the Kogi West Senatorial District is yet to be concluded by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
