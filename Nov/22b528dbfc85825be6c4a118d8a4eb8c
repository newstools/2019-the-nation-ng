Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi on Thursday visited the tragic scene of the building collapse in Akaeze, Ivo LGA of Ebonyi State which claimed the lives of three siblings. The Nation had reported how the three siblings lost their lives when the mud building they lived collapsed. They were children of one Mr. Sunday Okereke. Mr Okereke’s wife Elizabeth and another son survived and were rushed to hospital. The 43 years old commercial motorcycle rider blamed the ugly incident on mysterious rain. A statement Governor Umahi’s Media Aide, Francis Nwaze said the governor on hearing the shocking news moved to see the incident site. He commiserated with the bereaved family, noting that it is difficult to bear a huge loss of three children without any form of sickness but through such accident. Mr Umahi noted that such occurrence is first of its kind in the state and ordered for investigation into the root cause of the incident. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Kenneth Ugbala, the governor urged the family to take heart as God is still God while praying God to divinely bless the living in such a way that those alive will replace the vacuum that may be created by the incident. Governor Umahi equally thanked the Chairman of Ivo LGA, Hon. Ogbonnaya Chukwu Ude and Coordinator of Akaeze Development Center, Kingsley Ogbadu for taking quick action by starting a new house for the family. He also made donation of undisclosed amount of money to the family and assured them of more assistance.
