The Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) has initiated moves to retrieve its properties illegally acquired nationwide. It called on those laying claims to any property of the NRC to go to the nearest office of the corporation to regularise their claims. In a statement issued in Kaduna, the Assistant Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Mrs. Gloria Zinnass, urged all allottees of Railway land and landed properties nationwide to come forward and fully settle their rental obligations to the company. According to her, any person wishing to regularise his rental obligations to the NRC can do so by visiting any nearby Railway Property Management Company Ltd zonal, area or head office to pay their rents, including all outstanding rents without further delay or face stiff sanctions by the management.
