According to the eye witness, who preferred anonymity, said: “The old woman lived here with us (tenants) who are students of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree. Most of my colleagues were not around last night as I was the only one with her in the house. “At about 7:30pm, I told her I wanted to charge my phone somewhere as there was no electricity and I asked her (the old woman) not to close the door that I will be back soon. On returning I saw the doors of the house locked. “I was confused but had to go in through the back door to my own apartment which is upstairs to gain access to the building. On getting upstairs, I wondered why mama did not leave the door open as I requested. I got down to check Mama in her room and luckily, electricity had been restored. On getting to Mama’s room, I discovered she had been stabbed to death.” Meanwhile, the Police in Osun State said the investigation into the killing has started. The Public Relations Officer for Poloce in the state, Folasade Odoro, disclosed that the state Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Abiodun Ige, has visited the scene and directed detectives to commence immediate investigation.
