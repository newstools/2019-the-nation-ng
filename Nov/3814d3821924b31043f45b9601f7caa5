The ailment is called gastroenteritis and it is the name for the inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Gastroenteritis according to reports is a bacterial or viral infection which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Its symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

The disease affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated. In an interview with the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, he said the situation was under control as a result of the policies and interventions already put in place by the state government.
