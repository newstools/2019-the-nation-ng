Femi Otedola’s daughter, DJ Cuppy, has continued to prove doubters wrong. From the very moment she entered the Nigerian entertainment industry, only a few people gave her a chance. It was believed that she only wanted to leverage her billionaire father’s popularity and wealth. After making a name for herself as an entertainer, Cuppy has now spread her wings into fashion. In partnership with Payporte, she held an exclusive launch of her ‘Gelato Merch’ last Saturday, at Payporte Store, Lekki, Lagos. The singer said she was very excited about her new venture, saying it was inspired by her new song, ‘Gelato.’  She explained: “Gelato is about making people feel good and escaping to a different world – the Cuppy world – which is filled with colour and vibrancy. I am here to celebrate with my amazing fans and I cannot wait for people to try the amazing shirts, specially designed by me.” Cuppy also opened up on her plans to do more in the fashion industry, saying, “This is my first venture into fashion and I am definitely hoping it is not the last. I am looking forward to collaborating with my sister, Temi, who is into fashion.” The Chief Executive Officer of Payporte was present to receive Cuppy. According to him, as a household brand in the fashion industry, they were ready to give DJ Cuppy all the support she needs.
