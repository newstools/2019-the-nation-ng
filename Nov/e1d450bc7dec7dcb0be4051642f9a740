 A total of 8,304 final year students of Kwara State origin have each been paid N5000 as bursary straight into their accounts following weeks of electronic processes and verification of their applications by the government. The AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq administration had recently launched a strictly e-bursary in a step meant to ensure that the process is transparent, with all eligible students directed to apply through a dedicated portal. The governor had approved N50m for the second tranche of 2019 bursary, but insisted that applicants must apply online and have their money paid straight into their accounts without any middlemen. â€œA total of 10,491 successful applications were received within a period of four weeks, but only 8,304 of them were verified to be genuine and therefore recommended for payments. Consequently, payment is now being effected, according to a statement by Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Tertiary Education, Dr Musa Dasuki.
