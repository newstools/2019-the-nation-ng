He said that Gen Sarham was spearheading the desperate attempt to rewrite the results of the election to rig it in favour òf the APC. He said that soldiers under the command of Sarham had commenced indiscriminate of arrest PDP leaders in Ogbia. Among those in custody are the Council Chairman, Hon Ebinyon Turner;  two lawmakers, Hon Gibson Munalayefa and Mrs. Naomi Ogoli. Cleopas lamented that while PDP members were being arrested and taken to unknown destination, the election results for Ogbia were also being rewritten.
