 SUPER Eagles captain Ahmed Musa marked his injury return with a brace – the first a spectacular effort from distance – to help Al Nassr to a comfortable 5-1 victory over Afief on yesterday. Speed merchant Ahmed Musa showed his readiness to lift Nigeria above Benin Republic and Lesotho in the upcoming African Cup of Nations qualifiers next week by smashing in two fantastic strikes for his Saudi Arabian side in a Kings Cup tie at the Al Majma’ah Sports City Stadium (Al Majma’ah). Musa, whose last match for Nigeria was in Egypt at the 2019 AFCON where coach Gernot Roh’s men picked up a bronze medal, opened the scoring for Al Nassr just before the half hour mark with a wicked shot from 30 yards out which gave the Afief goalie no chance at all. Awadh Khamis gave the visitors a two-goal cushion that their dominance merited moments before the break, with Hamad Al Mansor making it 3-0 a mere five minutes after the restart. Ahmed Musa, 27, then got himself on the score sheet again four minutes later to complete his brace and put All Nassr four goals to the good. Giuliano then made it 5-0 from the penalty spot in the 71st minute. But Hamza Ben Abda got a consolation goal for the host with ten minutes left to play.
