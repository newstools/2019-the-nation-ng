 MEDIA personality, Cute Kimani has said her brand is a one-stop media agency. She disclosed this as she recounted milestones from the days of being ‘just an OAP.’ Kimani recounted that over the last two years, she has transited to the only OAP to execute a twitter Chat (#KimaniOffAir) for two years without missing a week, to handling reputation management. He expressed that her marketing agency, Estol Africa has managed over 300 campaigns within and outside the country. “None of it has been easy but the desire to access new and higher grounds keeps me going, the awards I have received and even nominations have also been an indication we are going in the right direction,” said Kimani, who has established affiliates in Ghana and Kenya. “My brand represents a one stop media agency that tends to the online and offline needs of brands,” she said, describing her brand. “From Digital planning to idea creation and curation of digital contents, to sourcing, engaging and managing social influencers for online and offline purposes, to Public relations, to talent management and online reputation management. We’re the bridge between brands and the digital space.”
