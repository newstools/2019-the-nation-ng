 A former Bayelsa State acting Governor, Chief Nestor Binabo, has dismissed reports that he and other prominent members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) returned to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the Saturday governorship poll in the state. Describing the insinuation as evil propaganda, Binabo said the likes of a former Chief of Staff, Dikievie Ikiogha, and former acting Governor, Werinipre Seibarugu, mentioned in the report were committed members of the APC working tirelessly to deliver the party’s candidate, Chief David Lyon, at the poll. He said there was nothing that would make him return to the PDP he left in 2015, adding that the current administration brought misery to Bayelsa. Binabo noted that the APC had become a mass movement in Bayelsa and was poised to take over government on Saturday to change the current narrative of underdevelopment and poverty in the state. He said: “The rumour is being disseminated by my detractors. I came over to APC in 2015 and I have stayed in APC. There is nothing in PDP again that will make me to go back to it. “Why will I go back to PDP when the so-called restoration government is a mess? “This is a government that has put every Bayelsan into misery. I am in APC. Every Bayelsan today is for APC. APC now is a mass movement to kick out the restoration government. “The rumour is embarrassing but I know that our friends on the other side are good at evil propaganda. “The likes of Seibarugu, Ikiogha can never go to PDP. We were all in our final rally. So, when did we go to PDP? It is propaganda by members of the PDP because they know we are men of caliber in the APC. “Definitely, the APC will win on Saturday because the people are all tired of the present administration.”
