 Minister of Youths and Sports Development Sunday Dare has lamented the slow pace of work on the Ibadan-Ogbomoso road by the contractor handling the road. He said work on the road, which had become a major concern, was progressing but not at the pace people wanted it. Dare spoke when the Abuja-based chapter of Egbe Ogbomoso Ajisegiri, a socio-cultural group, organised a reception for him and other Ogbomoso indigenes in the executive and legislative arms of the government. He said that all the elected lawmakers from Ogbomoso, including himself, had concluded plans to visit the Ibadan-Ogbomoso road with the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. Dare said: “The Ibadan-Ogbomosho road has been a major concern. I have been to the new road twice, work is progressing, but not at the pace we want it. But in the next two weeks, all the elected lawmakers from Ogbomoso, including myself, we are concluding plans to visit the Oyo-Ogbomoso road with the Minister of Works and Housing.” “We have had meetings with him and we know what the problems are. Besides funding, there are some other problems that are localised and we want to go there, talk to the Obas, the Baales and then see how we can have a major push to make sure that we complete that road as quickly as possible. “The number of deaths on that stretch of road increases by the month. There is need to stop that hemorrhage and we are doing everything on this side to make sure something is done.” The Chairman of the socio-cultural group, Olayiwola Akangbe, urged the minister not to relent in carving a niche for himself. “While we wish you great success during your tenure, just as we thank President Muhammadu Buhari and the others who found you worthy, we must also tell you to see your appointment as a public trust,” he said.
