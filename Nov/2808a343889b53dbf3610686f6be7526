  One person reportedly died in a fatal road accident yesterday, while seven others were injured and rushed to hospital for emergency treatment in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The accident involved a Toyota picnic car with registration number REL 815 XA and a trailer with number plate XA 705 DKU. Sources said the accident nearly caused pandemonium in the area, as some residents attempted to attack the driver of the trailer. He eventually escaped attack. The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr. Olugbenga Adeleye, who confirmed the accident, said the injured were rushed to the state specialist hospital for medical treatment. He identified high speed and lack of respect for traffic rules as the major causes of the accident. An eyewitness said the accident, which happened at 3;30pm, occurred when the Toyota picnic overtook a bus and collided with the trailer coming from opposite direction. It was, however, not certain where the two vehicles were going, but those who witnessed the accident said the vehicles were loaded with passengers and goods.
