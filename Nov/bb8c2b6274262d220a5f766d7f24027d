HUMAN Rights Activist, Sunday Ehimoni, on Wednesday urged a Federal High Court in Abuja to make an order disqualifying the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Kogi in the November 16 governorship election, Musa Wada, over alleged poor mental health records. The prayer is contained in a suit bearing file number FHC/ABJ/CS/1375/19 instituted by Ehimoni and filed by his counsel, Mr. Mike Ebah. The plaintiff is also seeking an order of the court disqualifying Wada from contesting the election by the virtue of Sections 182 (1) (c) and (b) of the Constitution, being a person with allegedly unsound mind. The plaintiff also prays for such further orders as the court shall deem fit to make within the contemplation of the suit. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the other defendants in the suits are the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In similar vein, the suit is seeking a declaration that the 3rd defendant is of unsound mind in view of his medical records, which emanated from the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Lagos State. The suit is also seeking a declaration that by the virtue of Sections 182 (1) (c) and 2 (a) (b) of the Constitution, Wada, being a person of alleged unsound mind, is not fit to contest election to the office of the Governor of Kogi State. The plaintiff is seeking another declaration that third defendant provided false information regarding his mental health as contained in INEC Form CF001 submitted by the 1st defendant (PDP) to the 2nd defendant (INEC). The suit, therefore, prays the court to disqualify Wada following the combination of actions of the three defendant, who by these acts, violated Section 31(2), (5) and (6) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). The plaintiff alleges that the defendantsâ€™ actions were also in violation of Section 182 (1) (c) and 2(b) of the constitution (as amended).
