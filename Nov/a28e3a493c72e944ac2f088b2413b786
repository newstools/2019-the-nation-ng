By Osagie Otabor, Bénin and Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Owan West local government have endorsed the second term ticket of Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Hon Philip Shaibu. The Owan West APC spoke at a rally attended by APC members from the 11 wards of the council area. Chairman of the council, Hon. Frank Ilaboya, said Obaseki has improved health care, education and build good roads across the state. Ilaboya stated that their support for Governor Obaseki was because salaries and pensions are paid promptly. He said Obaseki and Shaibu deserve another four years in office, stating that the 4+4 project was not negotiable. “We are gathered here this afternoon because of Governor Godwin Obaseki and Philip Shaibu 2020 project. Owan West want to tell the whole world that they are solidly behind the project and to endorse them for second term. There is no vacancy in Osadebey Avenue.” Other speakers at the event urged the mammoth crowd to support the Obaseki/Shaibu project. Highlight of the event was the donation of motorbikes by the council boss to the chairmen of wards 2 and 10, Hon. Lucky Aroye and Mr. Gentle Omage, respectively. Noting that the donation was part of measures to reward loyalty for the Obaseki/Shaibu project, Ilaboya urged the people to continue to support the party in the 4+4 movement in the local government area. Dignitaries that were in attendance are wife of the Council Chairman and Chairperson of Women Development Programme, Mrs. Patience Ilaboya; SA to the Governor on Political Affairs (Edo North) Hon. Ojo Asein; SA to the Governor on Strategic Planning and Programme Management, Dr. Uyi Oduwa-Malaka; council vice chairman Hon. Moses Mayah; Chief of Staff to EDHA Speaker Hon.
