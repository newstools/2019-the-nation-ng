Super Eagles and Villarreal Winger, Samuel Chukwueze has insisted that the best is yet to come from the current squad of the Super Eagles. Chukwueze also disclosed that the team didn’t panic after going a goal down in Nigeria’s 2-4 away victory to Lesotho in Maseru. “We never panicked. We knew we had what it takes to overturn the early goal, we just stayed calm and played our normal game. “It was a little difficult at first because of the pitch but once we got our rhythm, we got better as the games progressed.” Chukwueze believes that unity is the secret behind the team’s mental strength. “I think we see each other as brothers. We are always looking after each other on and off the pitch. This helps us also on the pitch especially in matches. We never give up. “We are also very talented and I think the best is yet to come from us. We will keep improving. Hopefully it will also pay off on the pitch.’ Meanwhile, midfielder Ramon Azeez reveals that he can’t wait to start getting regular playing time in the team, adding that he will give his best to Nigeria when called upon. The Granada midfielder, who returned to the Super Eagles after a five-year exile, came on for Joe Aribo in the 71st minute and supplied the pass for Victor Osimhen’s second goal eight minutes later. “There are players of incredible quality in this team. I always accept the coach’s decision and I have to keep working with humility, compete with my teammates and when I have the chance to give my all for the national team,” Azeez said. “I am calm and happy to be part of the group and I only have words of thanks for everyone because being here with my colleagues you can only learn more.”
