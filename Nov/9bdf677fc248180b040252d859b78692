There was power outage at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters in Lokoja where the final collation of results for the governorship election is taking place. The generating set being used suddenly went off when collation of the results from Lokoja was going on. The engineers are battling to get it working, while collation is put on hold.
