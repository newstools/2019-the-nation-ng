 The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Thursday affirmed the victory of Samuel Ortom as the governor of Benue State. The appeal was filed against the judgment of the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, which upheld the election of Ortom. The appellants are asking the appellate court to void the election of Ortom on the grounds that the election was not done in accordance with the electoral laws and that he won the poll with majority lawful votes. In their submissions by their counsel, the appellants are asking the court to set aside the decision of the tribunal and declare them winner of the March 9 governorship election. In a unanimous judgment, the panel presided over by Hon Justice A. O. Belgore dismissed the appeal by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Emmanuel Jime, for lack of merit and upheld the judgment of the lower tribunal. A cost of N150,000 was awarded against the appellant. Ortom described the judgment as a victory for the people, who gave him a second term mandate. Reacting to the judgement which affirmed his victory through a statement signed by his media aide, Terver Akase, and made available to The Nation, the governor said the Appellate Court’s verdict has not only validated the earlier judgment of the tribunal, but has also confirmed the choice of the voters. He thanked God Almighty for giving him the opportunity to lead the state for another term. Ortom called on Mr. Emmanuel Jime, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 poll, to support him to develop the state.
