The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed November 30 for the supplementary election for the Kogi West Senatorial District. This follows the declaration of last Saturdayâ€™s Court of Appeal ordered rerun between incumbent Senator Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Senator Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as inconclusive. The November 16 rerun witnessed cancellation of results across the seven councils, following alleged widespread violence. The supplementary will take place in 20 Wards and the 53 polling units that are affected.
