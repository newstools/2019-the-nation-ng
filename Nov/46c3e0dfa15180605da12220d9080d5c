The Oyo state born artiste noted that he realised that so many people especially the youths are depressed due to either the situation of the country’s economy or personal issues. “So many things that we hardly hear of in the past are happening nowadays. If you read the news you will find out how people are committing suicide due to lack of money or because they failed their exams. “But whatever you face in life you just have to pray for grace to overcome it. I know it’s not easy but we should always remember that this time shall pass. “My new song, Happiness is meant to reach out to those who are depressed so they can snap out of it. If you die then you are gone forever. You have to live for your own sake and for the sake of those who love you. There is more to this life”, he said. According to Adewoyin, ‘Happiness’ is simply a way of preaching that you can be happy at no cost. “It doesn’t cost one kobo to be happy. You can find happiness in any situation you are. It is a mind set. A part of the lyrics reads; “I will never let no know control my happiness” that is you are in charge of your own joy and the earlier you realize that the better.” Adewoyin, however revealed that he is taking the project to the streets in December where he would be having an open show to reach out to the grassroots on how to avoid depression and embrace life.
