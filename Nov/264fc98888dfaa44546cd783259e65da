 The  Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has alerted that between January and July, this year, its customers in Kano, Jigawa and Kastina are indebted to the turn of N10billion “uncollectible”  outstanding electricity bills. Head of KEDCO Corporate Communication, Ibrahim Sani Shawai , who made this known on Friday, declared that the development was “not healthy” for business. He said a private enterprise that has to pay to get electricity from the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) as well as other generating companies (GenCos) in the country, could not survive any loss of this magnitude. He stated that the rampant cases of illegal connection by saboteurs as well as the non-challant attitude of some of our  customers in paying their electricity bills, has also posed serious threat to the operational activities of the company. Shawai explained that these challenges have hampered the company’s drive at meeting the electricity demand in their franchise states of Kano, Jigawa and Katsina. According to the company, increasing wave of power theft, and vandalism of their facilities are the major challenges affecting power distribution in Kano, Jigawa and Katsina states. The company however appealed to host communities to protect electricity transformers and other facilities against the activities of saboteurs and conserve power by switching-off  all electrical appliances when not in use, as this would improve power in the country.. Shawai said that a new whistleblower policy that will enable individuals to report cases of electricity abuse in their communities was in the offing, adding that the company would reward such whistleblowers with five percent of whatever amount the offender will be charged.
