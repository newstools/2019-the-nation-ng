SHARON Stone recreated her infamous Basic Instinct scene on stage at the GQ Men of the Year Awards – and in front of son Roan Bronstein – because why not? The moment the 61-year-old deliberately flashed police – and the audience – while crossing her legs during an interrogation scene has gone down in history as one of the most controversial moments in cinema. And, 27 years after the scene caused the world to stop in its tracks, she reminded us all of it in Berlin. While accepting the award for Woman of the Year, Sharon took a second to sit on a chair on stage before crossing her leg, in front of a packed out crowd. Discussing the infamous scene, the icon recalled: ‘Some years ago I was sitting on a sound stage, and my director said, “Can you hand me your underpants because we’re seeing them in the scene and you shouldn’t have underpants on but we won’t see anything”. ‘I said, “sure.” I didn’t know this moment would change my life,’ before encouraging everyone in the audience to recreate the moment with her. Following an impassioned speech about learning to love who you are, she added: ‘Thank you for choosing me to be Woman of the Year, because there was a time when all I was, was a joke.’
