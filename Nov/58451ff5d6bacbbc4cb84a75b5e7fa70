At least 115 local contractors on Wednesday took part in an open bid for the renovation of public schools recently advertised by the Kwara State Government. The bid, conducted in the presence of the media and the contractors, followed Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq’s directive about government contracts adhering to the public procurement process. Mariam Garba, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, said the first phase of the project involves eight first generation schools in the state, which will undergo comprehensive renovation. Twenty three others would have their classrooms and offices renovated and basic infrastructure supplied to make learning conducive in the schools, Garba said. She said the projects would be executed under 34 lots at the total sum of N2,004,205,641.01. “The infrastructure decay/deficit inherited is so enormous and cannot be immediately remedied (in one fell swoop) due to the huge cost required,” Garba said.
