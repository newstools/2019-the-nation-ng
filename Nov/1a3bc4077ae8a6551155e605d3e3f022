NIGERIA equities recorded their biggest rally in two months last week as increased bargain-hunting for quoted shares added N261 billion to market value of quoted companies. Average return stood at 2.04 per cent last week, driven mainly by scurry for banking shares, which posted average return of 6.77 per cent. The negative average year-to-date return improved to -14.57 per cent. With nearly four advancers to every decliner, aggregate market value of all quoted equities crossed the N13 trillion mark to N13.071 trillion at the weekend compared with its week’s opening value of N12.810 trillion. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) also rose from its opening index of 26,314.49 points to close weekend at 26,851.68 points. The positive performance came on the heels of Central of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s recent policies on fixed income securities and increasing decline in yields. Analysts at Cordros Securities said the limited outlet for investments due to the CBN’s recent policy directives was a force behind the market. “We expect that the market might continue to benefit over the short-term especially in the face of lower yields in the fixed income market,” Cordros Securities stated. Analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited noted that with the yield on fixed income investments becoming less attractive, more funds will flow into equities market.
