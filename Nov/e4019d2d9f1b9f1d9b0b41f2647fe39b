THE Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr Adedamola Kuti on Tuesday night said that contrary to misleading media reports, “the Eko Bridge is open and not closed.” Kuti said this during a joint media briefing with the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye and the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Fredrick Oladeinde, at Alausa. He explained that work was rather ongoing on Apongbon Bridge to replace an earlier palliative work to change the road from flexible to rigid pavement that would last longer. “We want to correct the impression that because of the work that Eko Bridge has been shut down permanently; there is no truth in that, what we are just doing is that we are working on that stretch (Apongbon Bridge). “It is a just a stretch of about 150 metres, and as we work, the construction area has been divided into two; while we take care of one segment, traffic is allowed to use the other segment to now enter into Eko Bridge,” he said.
