Senior Manager, Oil, Gas and Power, Andersen Tax, Chinwendu Enechi, has advised the tax regulatory authorities to make voluntary compliance easier for tax payers while dealing with payment challenges. Enechi, who spoke with The Nation exclusively in Lagos, noted that while the tax man is interested in tax compliance, tax regulators on their part need to do more in terms of ensuring that modalities for tax payment are made easy, including making sure that voluntary compliance to tax payment is simplified. “I don’t need the tax person/regulator to come to me first and say I owe taxes. I need to be able to sit down and do self-evaluation to recall whether I owe. And if I am owing, I am going straight to the tax office/regulator to say this how much I am owing, but then I need to go there without any fear of intimidation afterwards. So the regulators need to make the issue of compliance easier for people. Voluntary compliance needs to be encouraged because if they are not encouraged, you then have a situation whereby you want to collect so much tax but you have very few people who are willing to pay those taxes and you cannot continue to squeeze the existing tax payers”, Enechi explained.
