The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has condoled with the family of the Managing Director, Prestige Hotel, Mr. Felix Edosomwan, over the death of his mother, Late Mama Omorose Edosomwan. The governor who led other members of the state executive council to the residence of Mr. Edosomwan in Benin City, said, “We can’t but be here on this condolence visit because we know how close you were to mama. “When I got your text that mama has passed on, I could feel that sense of loss. I know how close you were to mama since our secondary school days; you have been mama’s boy. I am here to thank God for mama’s life because she lived a full and eventful life. He added, “She was prayerful, always there for us and I know how prayerful and supportive she was during my 2016 electioneering campaign.” Obaseki urged the Edosomwan family to celebrate and thank God for the life of the deceased, noting, “I am sure that she achieved all that she prayed for; when we reflect on her legacies, we have every reason to thank God for her life.” The second son of the deceased, Mr. Felix Edosomwan thanked the governor and his entourage for the condolence visit. Edosomwan said his late mother was loving, hardworking, prayerful.
