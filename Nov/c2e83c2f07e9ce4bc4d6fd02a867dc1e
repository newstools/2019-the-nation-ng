Two men identified as Sunday Usenobong, 50, and Olatunde Femi died last week at their places of work in industrial accidents. Usenobong, an employee of Landcraft Industry Nigeria Limited in Ikorodu, was said to have fallen into a melting pot around 3.30am on Saturday, while Femi got his head stuck in a moulding machine he was operating Multipak Nigeria Limited, a plastic production company at Oregun last Wednesday. Police said both victims died on the spot and homicide detectives were invited to the scenes for investigation. “The bodies were evacuated to public mortuary for autopsy. Investigation is ongoing in both cases,” police public relations officer Bala Elkana said. “Femi was a moulding machine operator at the company which is located at Plot F28, Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun. “He allegedly got trapped while operating the machine around 8.30pm that day and died on the spot,” he said. Meanwhile, the Lagos State Safety Commission on Sunday sealed the premises of Multipak Nigeria Limited for alleged violation of safety regulations and lack of safety management system. Director-General of the agency Lanre Mojola said investigation had also commenced on the incident at Landcraft, a steel industry in Ikorodu where the 50-year-old man died at the weekend. If found wanting, he said the premises would also be sealed and the company prosecuted. Mojola said the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration has zero tolerance for factories and organisations that violate health and safety rules. “Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration is passionate about the safety of life and property of its citizenry. On no account should any factory operate without putting in place safe systems of work processes, good housekeeping, safety signage, firefighting and suppression equipment. “There must be good electrical wiring systems and a clean environment devoid of hazards to the lives of workers and visitors,” said Mojola.
