Tony Akowe, Abuja  The House of Representatives is to investigate the fragrant violations of Nigeria’s labour laws by International Oil Companies operating in the country and the casualisation of Nigerian working in such companies. The House, at its plenary on Thursday also asked the Minister of Labour and Employment and other relevant Ministers to immediately address the challenges of exploitation and abuse of workers in the nation’s oil and gas sector. The House also asked the Minister of Labour to provide the House a performance update and report plans to reform the process of granting and renewing recruiters’ license to Labour contractor as announced in July 2018. The House resolution followed a motion sponsored by Hon. Benjamin Kalu on the alleged violation of Nigeria labour laws and the casualisation of Nigerian workers. He told the House that the ugly trend of work casualization in the oil and gas sector by International Oil Companies (lOCs) creates uncertainty of employment for thousands of workers who are constrained to operate under very precarious conditions with near total denial of the benefits associated with permanent and decent work. He said that a recent report by the Campaign for Democratic Workers Rights pegged the number of casual workers in the Nigeria workforce at 45%, and also stated that 50% of the burden of casualisation exists in the downstream oil and gas sub sectors of the economy, telecommunications, banking, construction, mining and some other work places. He recalled the constant industrial dispute in the oil and gas sector in the country as a result of alleged unfair labour practices by the IOC, adding that such industrial actions often cost the government several billons of naira daily. He said “sometime in July 2018, in light of the frequency of those allegations, the federal government announced a plan to reform the process of granting and renewing recruiters license to labour contractors with the aim of ensuring adherence to expatriate quotas and eschewing unfair labour practices, despite allegations of unfair labour practices by IOCs still abound.”
