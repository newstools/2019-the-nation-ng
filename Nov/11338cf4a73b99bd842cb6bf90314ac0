Augustine Ehikioya, Abuja  Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru, on Friday, declared that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is now well-positioned to win the forthcoming governorship election in Bayelsa State. Badaru, who is the Chairman of the APC gubernatorial campaign in Bayelsa, spoke with State House correspondents on coming elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States, after the jumaat prayer at the Villa. He said, “We are very prepared for Bayelsa election and the stake is open for us to take.” On the allegation of recruiting one thousand thugs to distort election, he said, “I am not aware of that.” “I am chairing Bayelsa election I am not chairing that of Kogi. What I know, none of our members would go against the law. The governor in Kogi is responsible for the security of the state and he has done well in terms of security.” On the chances of APC in the forthcoming guber election in Bayelsa, the Jigawa governor said, “We have a very high chance, you have seen our rally, you have seen PDP rally, you have seen and heard of many big wigs going out of PDP and joining us. That is a clear indication that they are with us and that success is with us. In terms of security, Badaru said, “I think that is federal government issue. The federal government promised to provide security and I believe this question should be directed to the security agencies, mine as a party man, I supervise the election as the governor appointed to look after the election.” He advised the Bayelsa people to remain peaceful, and “do one-man-one-vote, one -woman-one-vote and we know we will win. We will not tolerate any form of rigging or ballot box snatching and if it is done that way, APC will win with a landslide.”
