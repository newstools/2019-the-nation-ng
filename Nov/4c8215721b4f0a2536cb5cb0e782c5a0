Agency Reporter  The Allied People Movement governorship candidate in the March 9th governorship election in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, on Saturday said he would be approaching the Supreme Court to challenge the Appeal Court judgement which affirmed the victory of the state governor, Dapo Abiodun. Addressing his loyalists and other representatives of the party from the 57 local government and local council development areas at the party secretariat, Abiola Way, Leme, Abeokuta, the state capital, Akinlade said he was sure of victory at the Supreme Court. While expressing his confidence in the judiciary, Akinlade asked his supporters to remain calm and resolute as the party takes his case to the Supreme Court. Akinlade had dragged the Governor Abiodun of the All Progressives Congress (APC) before the Appeal Court, sitting in Ibadan. This was after the Justice Yusuf Halilu-led governorship election petition tribunal in Ogun State last September, threw out Akinladeâ€™s petition and affirmed Abiodun as the winner of the March 9 election. Agreeing with the decision of the election tribunal, the Appeal Court also dismissed the petition. The APM candidate told the party faithful that the decision to approach the Supreme Court was in agreement with elders and leaders of the party at a review meeting of the entire process.
