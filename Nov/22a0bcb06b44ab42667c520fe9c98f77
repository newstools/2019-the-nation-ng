 ONE month after the Ochanja market in Onitsha, Anambra State was gutted by fire following a petrol tanker explosion, victims of the disaster said they were still waiting for the much-advertised government’s assistance. The articulated truck laden with petrol, on October 16, 2019, spilled its contents in the drainage after it fell at Upper Iweka, claiming lives and property. Government compiled a list of the victims. Federal government through the Minister of Human Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq also promised both food and non-food relief materials. Some of the over 300 traders whose property, shops and wares worth billions of naira were consumed by the inferno, alleged that government was yet to make good its promises. One of them , Kenneth Osita Nneke, told The Nation that he was yet to receive anything from the government or any other. “I did not receive any kobo from the state government or any top politician. Nobody has contacted me or anybody I know as regards how they can assist us to mitigate our losses. “Since the incident happened, we have not seen anything in that regard”, he said. Spokesman of the landlords/plaza owners association at Emordi Shoe and Bag Market, Chief Anthony Okonkwo, said, “Our cry is for government to help us recover what we have lost. We are not fighting anybody. We only want government to hear us. Most of the victims now have nothing to do. Some are frustrated and have gone to their villages and more are dying while some are in the hospital.” Responding, Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba appealed for patience, assuring them of soon response once the committee set up by the government was done. “We do appreciate their emotions and understand their difficulties. As a responsible government, we will soon come make good our promises of assisting the victims,” he said.
