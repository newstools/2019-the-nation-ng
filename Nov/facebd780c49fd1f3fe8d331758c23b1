CECILIA Nku’s second minute penalty was all Rivers Angels needed to win the 2019 Nigeria Women Premier League title against a very determined Confluence Queens side. In a well-attended final which had the Sports minister Sunday Dare and Women affairs minister Mrs Pauline Tallen in attendance, the final lived up to its expectation as the fans were delighted with entertaining football from both sides. The victory gave the Edwin Okon’s side their seventh title having won the league last in 2016. An emotional Edwin Okon said after the game that he knew his side wouldn’t concede and scoring an early goal was important to them. “We worked hard for this and deserve to win, Confluence Queens gave us a lot of fight, but we remained resolute and defended well. This victory means a lot to me and my players,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Whyte Ogbonda who has failed to beat Rivers Angels in three consecutive finals was unhappy with the result, but promised to keep fighting. “I am not happy with the result today. I thought we deserve a better result from what we got. We were unlucky to lose a penalty when we needed to have scored. We go back to Lokoja with a heavy heart and we won’t relent. The winner of the 2019 Nigeria Women Premier League will go home with a sum of N3m and a one week tour to Spain as part of the Laliga/NWFL partnership deal.
