James Azania, Lokoja The Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu has approved the deployment of 35,000 policemen for the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State. Making this known in Lokoja, on Wednesday, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kogi command) in-charge of Operations, Ayilara Oluwakayode, said that all measures have been put in place towards the attainment of a free, fair and credible election in Kogi. Speaking at the “Stakeholders Conflict Scan Analysis on Electoral Violence in Kogi State” organised by Search for Common Ground, a non governmental organization (NGO), the ACP, noted that the choice of ensuring a violence free election is for all to make. Allaying the fears of militarisation of the governorship election, he said that the presence of soldiers at polling units is not envisaged during the exercise. He however expressed worries over incidents of violence, particularly in the Kogi East Senatorial District. He said that in addition to the four policemen to be posted to each of the
polling units on election day, personnel, four per unit, from other security agencies will also be on ground. According to him: “This election is a special one, being that it will hold in two states (Kogi and Bayelsa), and the IG has graciously deployed 36,000 police officers for the Kogi election. “I can assure you that the police is on the ready for the exercise. The election is not going to be militarized, I can asure you. Soldiers will only be at border points, and can only come in when they are invited. “In the last couple of days, reports of culpable homicide have been reported in Dekina. Just yesterday here, two thugs were at each other, and one shot the other, houses were burnt. “On our part, the police will continue to do its work because that is what we are employed for, but it is important to note that we are all stakeholders in this project.”
