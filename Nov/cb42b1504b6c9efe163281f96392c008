by Oladapo Sofowora  If there is anyone who believes so much in the words of Harry Golden that “ The only thing that overcomes hardluck is hard work”, it is no other person than Akwa-Ibom state firstlady, Deconess Martha Udom-Emmanuel. Indeed, if you ever tell her she has gotten to this enviable position in life based on luck, she will probably shake her head in disapproval and declare that it is all a product of hard work and the absolute grace of God. The third child of High Chief Bernard Sampson Idiong and Prof. Stella Idiong of Obio Akpa in Oruk LGA of Akwa Ibom in 1996, tied nuptial knots with her hearthrob, Governor of Akwa-Ibom state, Emmanuel Udom ever since then, they have both embarked on a blissful marital sojourn, blessed with beautiful kids. The aqua-cultural farming expert has been living a modest and simple life in line with biblical teachings even as firstlady. A devoted Christian, preacher and women advocate, she is the Patron African Women in Leadership Organization (AWLO) and Patron Nigerian Medical Women Association to mention a few. Last week, at the just concluded convocation ceremony of University of Uyo, Uyo, where she graduated several years back with a degree in Biochemistry, the Eka-Uwana as she is fondly called, was conferred with an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy of Science in Social and Human Sciences (Honoris Causa). We gathered that the conferment was as a result of her drive for charitable cause affecting humanity. This is evident in her pet project – Family Empowerment and Youth Reorientation Programme (FEYReP), which has touched the underprivileged across the state and beyond.
