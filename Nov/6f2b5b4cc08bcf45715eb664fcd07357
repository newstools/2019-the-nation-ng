By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa cannot be stopped despite many court pronouncements. It however said it will obey all court rulings related to the poll. INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, stated these in a telephone chat with The Nation in Abuja on Thursday. He said all electoral materials had been deployed, adding the election will go on as planned. Okoye spoke in reaction to a ruling by the Federal High Court, sitting in Yenagoa, in a case filed by one of the governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, which nullified the APC governorship primary, which produced David Lyon as candidate. Justice Jane Inyang, while giving her ruling, had restrained the INEC from including the governorship candidate Lyon, in the election. The ruling had created an atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion over the poll. But responding to a question from The Nation on how the INEC intends to manage the new situation, Okoye said the commission would do what it has always done in circumstances like this; obey legitimate court orders, however, it will still go ahead with its plans for the election, using the materials already prepared before the judgment was given. “I will tell you just two things. The first thing is that the election on Saturday will go on, and the second thing is that we are going to obey all legitimate court orders served on us. “The election will go on, the ballot papers have been printed and the ballot papers are being deployed. “Security forces are being deployed, INEC staff are being deployed and we are set for the conduct of this election. “If there’s any court order in relation to what we are doing, we will obey all court orders because that has been the tradition of the commission; to obey all legitimate court orders.”
