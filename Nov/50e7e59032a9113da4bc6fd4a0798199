SCARF! No other set of head and neck accessories have captured the imagination of fashion buffs this new season as scarf. It has become a hot fashion item. It keeps the hair securely away from the face and its colourful and vibrant nature adds a touch of subtle whim to your head, neck or look. Dazzling and bold scarves are the rave of the moment when it comes to head and neck fashion, at parties and social occasions; and your choice of scarf should be influenced by the type of your dress (whether official or casual) and the colour. They are getting more stylish and itâ€™s always in vogue and because it comes in several beautiful colours, it always appears to be forever in vogue.
