Named Oluwafikayomi Oluwadamilola Tomori 21 years ago, England and Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori can never forget his Nigerian roots.  “I enjoy Nigerian music, I’m Nigerian; it’s my culture and I’m very proud of it,” he said simply without much ado.  But for time, Tomori said maybe he would have accepted the invitation of Nigeria FA to play for his fatherland rather than his adopted country. He was selected in Gareth Southgate’s latest squad for Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria earlier last month. Tomori’s parents are of Nigerian descent while he is also eligible for Canada having been born in Calgary, representing them three times at Under-20s level. His break into Chelsea’s first-team under Frank Lampard this season sparked a scramble to secure his international future but Tomori insisted he had no contact with Nigeria prior to accepting Southgate’s call. “England called me up in September, and I didn’t get a call up from anyone and when they called me up, it was hard to say no to them (England).” Fikayo, however, is dead sure about his ancestry and feel every inch Nigerian. “I am first child and the only son of my parents. My father hails from Osogbo, Osun State, South-West Nigeria. My parents were living in Lagos-Nigeria before relocating to Canada where I was born. We moved to London when I was seven years old and that gave me the opportunity to join Chelsea Academy.” He said he was led to choose Chelsea ahead of other London clubs because of its belief in African players. “As a kid, I watched Didier Drogba and his exploit at Chelsea inspired kids with African roots like me. I met other guys with Nigerian roots like Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi at the Academy and that helped me to feel at home. Drogba made every member of my household to support the club, and partly because I was there too.” His path crossed with that of (Tammy) Abraham at age seven when he joined Chelsea Academy and he said since then, they have remained inseparable. “Tammy and I have been here (Chelsea Academy) since we were seven and so has Mason, even though he’s a year younger than us. We’ve gone through the whole process and we’ve seen a lot of people come and go, so to get to this stage is good but obviously now we want more. We want to really cement our places in the team and do big things for this club.” Playing for Chelsea senior team, he noted, is a dream come true but the journey wasn’t a bed of roses. “Upon joining, I was deployed to the club’s under-8 level. My friendship with Tomori progressed to teenage years and together we played many matches together and took it with calm and grace. We endured many difficult times together until we started wining laurels at the youth level. We helped the Chelsea youth team in recording back to back triumphs in both the UEFA Youth League and the FA Youth Cup. I also scored in both finals and was named the 2016 Chelsea FC academy player of the year. The breakthrough came when the England U20 team spotted us and in 2017, I helped the England U20 team in winning the FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their history in South Korea.” This was followed by the 2018Toulon Tournament where he triumphed with England U21. In spite of these victories, Chelsea was not ready to gamble with him, prompting his loan move to Derby County in the Championship, England lower division. “Chlesea and England legend, Frank Lampard, came for me. He gave me the opportunity to play in the main team and I did not disappoint. I became a regular help for them to reach the play-off final of the Championship.’ He was named The Derby’s Player of the Year at the end of his first season with the club. This earned him a club record of becoming the first loan player to win this award. The relationship between Lampard and Tomori didn’t stop there. They reunited at Stamford Bridge after Lampard replaced Sarri for the Chelsea job. Lampard opted for Tomori and his friends that came through the Chelsea Academy and so far it has paid off handsomely after going through six-match winning run. Tomori has become the fan’s favourite and scored in both the Premiership and Champions League, the same for his friend, Tammy. His dream is fulfilled. Meanwhile, Tomori speaks further on how his loan spell with Derby County and manager Lampard helped his breakthrough… Derby Support When Derby first called me and said they wanted to take me on loan, the first thing I thought about was the manager. He is such a legend, not only for Chelsea but for England and in the whole world. There is that automatic respect for him because of what he has done in the game. You can see the way he wants to play: to press, to be good on the ball, to rotate, to be attractive and to be difficult to beat. For us to make the play-offs in his first full season as a manager was great and we were fired up and  wanted to achieve promotion. I have a great relationship with the Derby fans. From the first day I got here they have been welcoming to me. They have supported me in the games where I haven’t done so well, or the team hasn’t performed as well. Home or away, they support us and that hashelped me out. I’m very grateful to them. They gave me self belief and anytime I get on the pitch I just wanted to play my heart out for them. My first full season in the Championship playing centre-back was eye opener for me. I have been learning that role and playing in a different sort of system to what I have played in so far in professional football: different positioning, different tactics. It was a real good learning curve for me in my development as a player, and I think I have learned a lot and definitely got better. Playing on the left side, I was forced to use my left foot a bit more. That helped me to adjust my play pattern well and it is no longer a problem for me again. I think I have done well in that position. I’ve been adding more to my game, things like switching the ball with my left foot. Stuff that I probably wouldn’t do on the right side I have had to do, and it’s made me a better player. At Derby County I also perfected the passing style. You have to be confident to receive the ball and pass it. There’s a lot of rotation going on between the midfielders and the forwards. The manager paid particular attention to me teaching me every week; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t but we all know what we are trying to do. I was ready to learn and the season ended well for me and the team. Most importantly it was at Derby that I learnt to enjoy league games, learn to make mistakes and correct them. Passing game, my strong point In the Championship in some games you need a quicker build-up and a switch of play to break down a team. The manager and Jody have been helping me add different styles of passing to my game, whether that’s short passes between the lines, breaking lines by finding the winger or the attacking midfielder, or going in behind to the striker. There are different types of movement they have been helping me with. I have tried to listen to it. The Championship is not that easy. The standard is high and there are great players there. The schedule also prepared me for what to expect in the Premiership. It’s difficult at times, especially around the Christmas period where you don’t really get time to train; it’s just recovery, play, recovery, play, but I have learned how to look after my body and how to manage myself a lot better. Training is good but games are where you can really improve and show your development. Playing some games helped me to develop myself, so when I was called upon to play at the Premiership I was confident that I would do well. At Derby I leant all what I needed to do well in at any level and the manager (Lampard) was there to help out. The progress from Championship to Premiership is what every young player must go through.
