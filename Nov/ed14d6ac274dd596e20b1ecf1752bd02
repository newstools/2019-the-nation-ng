EMBATTLED Technical Director of the Athletic Federation of Nigeria(AFN) Sunday Adeleye has been removed, making him the first casualty of the radical reforms taking place in the sports industry. The sack comes as the Secretary General of the AFN was also recalled by the Ministry and a new one will be announced. Adeleye’s removal followed the report of the Advisory Committee on the poor performance of Team Nigeria at the IAAF World Athletics Championships, Doha, Qatar this year.

The letter reads, “Consequent on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, I am further directed to convey the directive of the Honourable Minister for the immediate removal from office of Mr. Sunday Adeleye as Technical Director of the AFN on account of ascertained Gross Misconduct. Accordingly, you are directed to convey to Mr. Sunday Adeleye in writing this directive and evidence of compliance delivered to the Honourable Minister.” The Advisory Committee had in its report indicted Adeleye in varying degrees in the handling of the Federation’s affairs in Doha.
