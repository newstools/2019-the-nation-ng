Indigenes of Northern Cross River State Senatorial District have demanded screening of Tanko Ashang  as commissioner-nominee. The agitated constituents expressed concerns over the delay in the screening of Ashang, a lawyer, who is among the three nominees named by Governor Ben Ayade. They urged members of the House of Assembly to as a matter of urgency screen the nominee to avoid vacuum in the State executive council. Prof Ayade had through the Office of the Secretary to the State Government written to the Office of the Speaker of Cross River State House of Assembly,  in a memo dated November 14, nominating three persons for commisioners and requesting the house clearance. Besides Ashang, representing Obanliku Local Government Area, the other nominees are Peter Egba, from Obubra and Asuquo Ekpenyong from Obubra  and Odukpani local government areas respectively. The indigenes urged the lawmakers to expedite action on the screening of the nominee.
