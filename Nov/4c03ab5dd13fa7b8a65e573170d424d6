Air Peace has brought in a Boeing 737-800 New Generation to sustain its expansion, domestic and regional operations. The aircraft arrived the Murtala Muhammed International Airport  at the weekend from Europe. Disclosing this to reporters, a Corporate Communications Executive of the airline, Mr. Stanley Olisa, stated that the new arrival is a 160- seater aircraft comprising 16 Business Class seats and 144 economy class seats. He said: “We are very glad to announce the acquisition of another aircraft, which is a 160-seater B737-800 New Generation aircraft.” He said the resolve of the airline is to spread its operations across the length and breath of the country to ease the burden of travel within the country and the West African sub region. Air Peace last year became the first airline in sub-Saharan Africa to place an order for 10 B737 Max. The airline, earlier this year,  ordered 20 brand new 124-seater E195-E2 jets from Embraer, thereby making history as the launch customer of this new aircraft .  In 2017, Air Peace became the first airline to acquire and register a Boeing 777 in Nigeria. It later acquired three more 777s for its international operations, which started on July 5, last year, with flights to Dubai through the Sharjah International Airport. The airline said soon it will take on more international routes — London, Houston, Johannesburg, Bombay and Guangzhou. The airline management thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating the enabling environment. Olisa said: “Our Chairman, Mr. Allen Onyema, is eternally grateful to President Buhari for making it possible for Air Peace to become what she is within the four years of President Buhari’s regime through the zero tax regime on imported commercial aircraft and aircraft spares introduced by his administration.’’
