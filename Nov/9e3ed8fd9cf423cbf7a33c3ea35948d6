All is set for the Nigeria Triathlon Union (NTU) Community Course scheduled to hold on November 19 and 20 at the boardroom of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), National Stadium, Lagos. The course which is for game masters/mistresses and other stakeholders in the sport, will have 25 participants in attendance. The Community Course designed for sports teachers in schools will see athletes drawn from schools in Surulere take part in demonstration exercise during the course. The resource person for the course is Coach Bashir Mohammed, the Deputy Technical Director of the NTU, who has been to several International courses and competitions on behalf of the Union. Coach Bashir will be supported by the National Chief Coach, Goodie Amaefula while coaches Modupeola Ofonedu, Loya Barakumo and Perelate Gbagi will be his assistants. However, another Community Course will be held before the end of the first quarter of next year in spreading the sports and knowledge of the new rules/regulations as well as sourcing of young and new triathletes. Meanwhile, the NTU is planning ‘A Special Dinner’ for sponsors and media partners during the first quarter of next year to say ‘Thank You’ and express their appreciation and gratitude for their support over the years.
