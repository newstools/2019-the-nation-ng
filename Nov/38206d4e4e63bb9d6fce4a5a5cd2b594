By Omolara Akintoye THE third edition of the Plus-size Fashion Week Africa (PFWA) is set to hold on Sunday, December 8, 2019, at The Traffic Bar & Restaurant, Ikoyi, Lagos. PFWA is a fashion runway show that highlights plus size models and apparels. This year’s event will feature a plus-size runway fashion show with 10 established and emerging designers. Hence, the PFWA team is calling on designers to showcase their designs at this year’s edition. The theme for the event is ‘Fashion & Nature’. “We have decided we are going for nature this year away from hotels and event centre hence the choice of the venue,” said the convener, Mrs. Temi Aboderin-Alao during a briefing. “We want people to relax with nature and everything beautiful.”  According to Aboderin-Alao, the focus of the brand has been the African woman and empowering black people. “We would like to invite all talented Plus-size designers to showcase their craft on the runway and show every plus-sized woman that they are beautiful regardless of their body-size,” she said. “Plus-size is not a disease, but rather beautiful. You can be the healthiest version of who you are and be plus-size. “The Plussize Fashion Week Africa was birthed out of the need to stop the stigmatization and body shaming of the plus-sized woman; we believe that every woman should be comfortable in her skin and body regardless of what the society thinks as long as they are healthy.”
