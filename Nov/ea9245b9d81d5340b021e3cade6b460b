The National President of the Private Education Developers’ Association of Nigeria (PEDAN), Elder Festus Awodoyin, has hailed Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for promoting education. Awodoyin, who spoke on Thursday in Ajegunle, Lagos, at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and first anniversary of the association, said that Lagos State government should be praised for promoting the educational sector. He said the Sanwo-Olu administration, since its inception, had done a lot to eradicate illiteracy by promoting education. Awodoyin implored the government to support the PEDAN in order to take education to the next level. He said: “The PEDAN, in the last one year, has put together through a constitutional conference, a generally accepted constitution as its guiding principles and laws. “It has organized a unified examination for primary six pupils in our schools where many of our pupils who excelled were given prizes. “The association has facilitated the participation of member schools in the Lagos State placement examinations into public secondary schools in the state.  All our candidates performed well and have been placed in public schools of their choice. “The PEDAN Multipurpose Cooperative Society has been put together to attend to the financial needs of members.” The PEDAN national president said the vision of the association is to create a credible alternative in the provision of low free education to the Nigerian child, adding that it is determined to achieve the vision. The event was attended by Dr. A.A. Olaoye of the Faculty of Education, Lagos State University, Ojo; the Chairman of Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government, Mr. Adekunle Ayoola; the Chairman of Ifelodun Local Council Development Area, Mr. Fatai Ajidagba, PEDAN members and others.
