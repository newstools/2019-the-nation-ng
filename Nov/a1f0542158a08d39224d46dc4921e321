 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bankers’ Committee of Nigeria, has urged youths in the country to embrace good savings culture. The advice came at the recent World Savings Day celebration held across the country. Themed “Savings Give Life a Lift”, the event, which held  across 565 local governments and reached over 80,809 students in 642 schools, was aimed at increasing public awareness and empower students with information on the importance of building a good savings culture, both for their financial future, as well as encouraging a sense of discipline and planning. The initiative also encompasses the CBN and the Bankers’ Committee’s drive to bridge financial literacy and inclusion, particularly for children in Nigeria. Speaking on the initiative, Chairman, Financial Literacy and Public Enlightenment Sub-Committee (FLPE), Mr. Emeka Emuwa said the importance of educating young Nigerians on the benefits of a good savings culture cannot be overemphasised. He observed that it is a good development to see financial institutions in the country take up the task of mentoring, educating, & empowering young Nigerians with critical information on building a savings culture, and increasing awareness on the importance of earning, managing and saving money in order to have a secure future. “Many of these students are our future Bankers and as such we will continue to develop programmes and activities that will further empower them,” he said. Emuwa explained that financial inclusion is a constituent pillar of the Bankers’ Committee mandate, making initiatives like this critical to the goal of increasing the number of financially included citizens in the country.
