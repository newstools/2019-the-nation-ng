WAPIC Insurance Plc has, within the period ended September 30, 2019 grown profit to N2.45 billion, a 78 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth from the N1.38 billion recorded in the preceding period of last year, its Managing Director, Mrs. Yinka Adekoya, said. In a statement,  she said the result is from the Group’s Unaudited Financial Results for the period ended September 30, 2019. She said the growth was driven by the company’s sustained leadership status in some major accounts, attainment of increased market shares and enhanced underwriting capabilities. She disclosed that the firm recorded 26 per cent YoY increase in gross written premiums for the period. According to her, the growth in premiums and decrease in net claims expense during the period under review had a positive impact on this position. She said: “The cost optimisation measures put in place continued to pay off as operating expenses dropped by 8 per cent to N3.2 billion year on year, compared to the prior period’s position of N3.5 billion. There was a notable growth in profit before tax for the period at 129 per cent to close at N1.1 billion compared to the N475 million in the same period of 2018. “Wapic Life Assurance wrote N2.1 billion in gross written premium within the nine months period, a 36 per cent YoY growth in premium performance compared to the 2018 position of N1.52 billion. Net claims expenses declined by 22 per cent to N778 million within the nine-month period compared to the corresponding year’s position of N995 million.
