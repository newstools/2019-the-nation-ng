Afolabi Idowu  A premium brand from the stable of International Breweries Plc, Budweiser, a proud member of the AB InBevfamily, has concluded plans to sponsor top-performing sales staff and distributors to watch select European Premier League matches as a way of rewarding and appreciating them for their hard work and commitment. A total of 54 persons are being rewarded for their performance in the recent financial year and to spur them on raising the ante. In a statement, Marketing Director, International Breweries, Mrs. Tolulope Adedeji, said that this move is one of the company’s ways of celebrating its distributors and employees as critical stakeholders of the organisation’s sales and distribution value chain having added value and contributed immensely to the business over the years. “We are very pleased with our distributors and sales team who have put in the effort and endless contributions towards ensuring the success of the business. As proud sponsors of both English Premier League and Spanish LaLiga, we decided to express our gratitude by giving outstanding sales staff and distributors an exciting experience that comes with watching EPL matches live at the stadiums. It promises to be a fun, unforgettable and exciting ride,” Adedeji said. Since Budweiser announced the signing of a multi-year deal with English Premier League and LaLiga in July, the King of Beers has continued to be one of the most visible brands in sports sponsorship. The brand has showcased its uniqueness at creating relevant, grand and memorable experiences with exciting, fun-packed viewing parties that not only bring fans of the sport together but promote conviviality and provide an avenue for them to watch these matches with their favourite celebrities. “As an organisation, International Breweries is delighted to make this trip happen for our partners who have shown dedication and hard work towards this business relationship. We encourage our distributors and employees to sustain the momentum that has led them here,” Adedeji added.
