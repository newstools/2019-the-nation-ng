The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, Chief Gboyega Oguntuwase, said on Monday that the era of impunity and imposition of candidates was over in the party. He said that the party would no longer allow imposition of candidates during its congresses and primaries, stressing that it was fully rebranded to win future elections. Oguntuwase lamented that imposition in the past by some leaders and outright anti-party activities had robbed the party of cohesion and success, saying: “We believe the best way to even bring those that are lost back to the party is to make sure we stand for justice and fairness.” The PDP chairman, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti, said that the victory of PDP candidate for Ekiti South Senatorial District, Senator Biodun Olujimi, at the Appeal Court as the winner of the election in the district had also strengthened the party and revitalised its spirit.
