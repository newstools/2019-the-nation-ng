 THE Court of Appeal sitting in Port Harcourt, on Friday  granted an ex parte order of injunction restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from disqualifying the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress  (APC) in today’s election in Bayelsa State. The three-member Appeal Court panel led by Justice,  Lokulo-Sodipo also restrained the INEC from executing the orders of Federal High to remove the name and logo of the APC and its governorship candidate, David Lyon,  for the governorship race. Justice Lokulo-Sodipi, in a ruling, said the panel was on the same page with Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal, which had asked INEC to maintain the status quo from   September 18, 2019, when the matter was instituted, pending the determination of motion on notice for interlocutory injunction. The Appeal panel ordered the applicants should serve all the respondents notices and other processes. The case was  adjourned to  November 21, for mention. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the proceedings,  counsel for  the governorship candidate of APC, Michael Numa,  welcomed the decision of the Appeal Court, which, he said, has given the APC and its governorship candidate, the opportunity to participate in the  governorship poll. Similarly,  counsel for APC, Sydney Igbanichuka said   that the position of the Court of Appeal would give opportunity to correct every wrong in the decision of the Federal High Court in Yenagoa, the state capital.
