Over 500 women have been empowered in line with the All Progressives Congress’ (APC) promise to make life better by Igando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA). The Council Chairman, Mrs. Morenike Adesina-Williams, said it will continue to partner with the state government, companies and individuals to enhance better life in Lagos State. The programme titled ‘Speed Up Lagos Initiative’, according to her, was meant to free the people from poverty and position women to contribute their quota to nation building. She said: “We will continue to partner with the state government to set our people free from poverty. We therefore call for partnership from organisations and individuals of repute with brilliant ideas like that of our erudite governor to empower our people, especially women and youth.” According to her, “Speed Up Lagos Initiative is designed by the state government to enable our women to be self reliant. Few months into office, our governor has started on a good note. We give him kudos for this vision and excellent initiative. It is a great opportunity that allows our women to be independent.”
