 THE Minster of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva has expressed delight at the quantum of construction efforts geared towards the completion at the Dangote jetty, refinery and petrochemicals which is many times bigger than the size of Victoria Island. Sylva, who spoke recently in Lagos during a one-day tour on the Lekki deep sea port, refinery and fertilizer plant developed by the Dangote industries, noted that such massive investment of an indigenous company is worthy of emulation. He expressed that the Federal Government has it as a priority to increase support to the private players that are willing to commit such enormous resources into the sector, adding that increased investment in the petroleum sector would not only enhance Nigeria’s level of productivity, but would also address the unemployment issues which is one of the major priorities of the government. “This is the most impressive project by an individual that I have ever seen. Dangote has turned the story of all of us, we must support this project to succeed. The whole world is looking at the success of this project before they can come and invest. We are fully willing to support this project. We would together find solution to the problems you may encounter. We are proud of you for such massive investment. We must support you to make sure that this project is a success,” he expressed. Earlier in his speech, the President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote stated that the driving factor for the investment was that he believes in Nigeria, adding that if Nigerians don’t invest in the country like this, no foreigner would do so. Dangote pointed out that Nigeria ought to feed West and Central Africa with products, adding that it was part of his motivating factor.
