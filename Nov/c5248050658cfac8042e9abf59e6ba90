Police in Sapele, Delta State, on Wednesday arrested Pastor Kingsley, popularly known as Obeba, of Jesus the Solution Church, a Pentecostal church, for allegedly calling a worshipper’s mother a witch. Obeba was said to have announced to worshipper Michael that his mother is a witch, a development  which reportedly informed Michael’s decision to stop visiting his mother. The pastor’s alleged pronouncement led Michael’s mother into inviting the police to arrest him. A family source, who pleaded anonymity, said the pastor “prophesied” some weeks back before his congregation that the boy’s mother was a witch, and that she was behind the boy’s problems. According to the source, “Michael stopped visiting his parents’ home because of the prophecy about the mother, but still attended the church which led to the family inviting the police who moved in swiftly and arrested the pastor.” A police officer at the station, who confirmed the arrest, said the church members came demanding for his release and were violent. All attempts to reach the pastor for comments failed as his phone was switched off.
