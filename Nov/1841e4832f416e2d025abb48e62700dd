Akeem Lawal  West Africa Boxing Union (WABU) champion, Rilwan ‘Real One’ Oladosu has sent a strong warning to African Boxing Union champion, Oto ‘Joe Boy’ Joseph to be ready to lose his belt at the ABU title fight, NationSport reports. Oladosu and Oto were earlier scheduled to clash in the ‘Fight of The Decade’ at the GOtv Boxing Night 20 on October 20 in Lagos, but the event could not hold following a shoulder injury sustained by the ABU champion while training with his sparring partner. Oladosu, who defeated Ola “Take Blow” Adebakin (1-5) with a first-round TKO at the maiden GOtv Boxing Night Mini show held at Rowe Park Sports Centre in Lagos on Saturday, said his focus has always been on the African title. “I’m so grateful for this victory. I did not train because of this fight rather I was training for the Africa title. That gave me the motivation to stop this guy as early as possible. “I’m training for Oto Joseph. He is the one I want to fight. I don’t need this kind of boxer. All these while, my focus is on Joe Boy. I don’t want to repeat the same class every year. I am the national and West African champion, now I need the African title.” I have the belief I can take the title because of my training, the coaches and my fans. “I’m using this opportunity to thank my coach, family and my fans for their support. I don’t have any other job than boxing and I want to use the sport to build myself,” Oladosu told NationSport.
