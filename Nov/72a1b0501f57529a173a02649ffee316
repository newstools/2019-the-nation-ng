Tackling the INEC form saying that politicians circumvent the use of card readers during elections, the PDP rejected what it described as attempts by the electoral umpire to shift the blame for its failure on political parties and the courts. According to its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the the PDP had consistently drawn INEC’s attention to electoral infractions created with the non-use of the card readers but that INEC had repeatedly ignored the party. He said: “The PDP totally rejects attempts by INEC to shift the blames for its failures to other political parties. It is on record that our party had consistently pointed to infractions created and allowed by INEC to facilitate rigging in elections. “While calling on Nigerians to remain calm, the PDP charges Prof. Yakubu and the INEC leadership under him to do the needful by vacating offices to save our electoral system from complete collapse. “It is instructive to note that the confession by INEC has not only vindicated our party, it has placed a huge burden on the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. The party described as unfortunate that INEC could suddenly claim that it has just realised that the card readers have lost steam in the electoral process.
