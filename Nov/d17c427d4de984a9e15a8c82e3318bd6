 A FORMER head of anti-cultism unit in the Edo State Police Command, CSP Abubakar Mohammed, has said that many arrested cultists in the state are reformed and returned to the society. Abubakar said the police are more interested in reforming cultists than sending them to prison. He spoke to newsmen in Benin City when he was honoured by a Notary Public Olayiwola Afolabi, for displaying discipline and excellence in the course of his duty. Abubakar said he was worried about increasing cases of cult-related killings despite numerous arrests made by the police. He said, “By the grace of God, Bénin is not hard in cultism. When we arrested cultists, we looked for pastors to preach to them and make them renounce cultism. They will go back to the society a clean person. Those that are deviants are the ones we take to court. We love seeing them go back to the society a good person. “I am worried about increasing cult killings. It is a matter we have been tackling. So much is expected from me now. I will not disappoint the society. We are begging parents whose children are cultists to bring them forward so that they can renounce. That is what we want.” Afolabi said he honoured Abubakar because many people do not appreciate effort by the police to rid the society of crime and criminal elements. “But if there is a crime they would not call the army, it is the police they would call. As the head of anti-cult, he does not sleep. Most times, he is on patrol at night.”
