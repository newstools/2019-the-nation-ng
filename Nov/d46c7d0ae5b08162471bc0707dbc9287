No the regular users of the Idi-Oro, Mushin end of the ever-busy Agege Motor Road, fallen articulated vehicles, and crater-sized potholes with murky water and long-winding vehicular queues have become a regular sight. This nightmarish road challenge residents and motorists face daily has now been compounded by activities of traffic robbers who terrorise them without let, The Nation learnt. Our reporter, who was on the road for on-the-spot assessment, observed that motorists have abandoned the inward Mushin lane and resorted to driving against traffic. Some of the drivers said they were scared of being stuck on the bad road as miscreants and hoodlums usually took advantage of the situation to carry out their nefarious operations in spite of the proximity of a police station to the place. They lamented that several appeals made to the government to repair the road had fallen on deaf ears. According to them, the road is a strategic one which connects most major highways in the state, just as they wondered why it was difficult for the government to rehabilitate it. “Trucks fall here daily and the traffic is usually unbearable but sadly, nothing is being done about it. If only the government could fix the bad portions of the road, it would ease traffic and spare us the agony of being robbed while driving,” said a motorist. A resident, Mr Olusola Adegoke who said he had lived in the area for seven years, told our reporter the road has been bad for about three years. “The road has been bad for the past three years and the government did not come to the aid of the citizens despite several lamentations,” he said.
