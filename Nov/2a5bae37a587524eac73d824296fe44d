THE planned passage of the 2020 budget by the Senate has suffered a setback, as the Red Chamber has said the exercise is no longer feasible. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Barau Jibrin, told his colleagues in the Senate, on Tuesday, that the report was not ready. He asked for one  week extension to enable the committee to complete the report and lay it before the Senators next alongside the details. “We have been able to collate all the reports of the sub-committees and we have so far analysed these reports. We have been able to put everything together with our team of experts.  What remains now is to crosscheck and make sure there is no mistake. Crossing all the “T”s and dotting all the “I”s. Thereafter, we will now go to print because we want to submit all the details. What remains now, it will take us up to Sunday, so by Monday we should be able to have all the clear details and then we will lay it on Tuesday,” Jibrin said. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, approved the request and said that the report of the budget must be laid “unfailingly” by the committee next Tuesday so that the Senate can consider and pass it within that week. Lawan said: “I am sure you are working with the House committee on Appropriation. The Senate will give you an additional week and that is unfailingly.  By the grace of God, you should be able to lay it here and the Senate should pass it within that week.” It would be recalled that Lawan had consistently promised that the Senate would pass the budget on November 28, a date that is no longer feasible.
