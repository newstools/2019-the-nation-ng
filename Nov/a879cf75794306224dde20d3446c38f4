 A philanthropic organisation, Cancer Enlightenment and Support Foundation has paid the cost of surgery for a cancer patient, Mrs Gloria Eze. The Nation had published Gloria’s appeal for financial assistance for the surgery on Saturday August 10. The cost of surgery was N244,800. The foundation led by its Chairman, Board of Trustees, Mr Adegboyega Adepitan paid Gloria’s medical bill on August 16. The cheque for the surgery was presented to the patient who had been receiving treatment at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) Ikeja, Lagos. Speaking during the presentation of the cheque, Adepitan, also a colon cancer survivor urged the federal and state governments to provide free diagnostics for cancer patients. “The ideal thing is that the government should provide free diagnostics for cancer patients because the cost of diagnostics alone is one of the reasons people don’t go for check-ups in Nigeria. Health insurance should also cover cancer treatment. “There is also the need for the government and the private sector to collaborate to fund the procurement of radiotherapy equipment. The ones we have in Nigeria cannot take care of 10 per cent of cancer patients. Being diagnosed with cancer is not a death sentence,” Adepitan said. Adepitan said the foundation decided to pay the medical bill of the cancer patient because the government alone could not fund the health sector. In her remarks, Gloria recalled she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2015 and thanked the foundation for coming to her aid. Meanwhile, the foundation last week gifted another cancer patient a sum of N308, 000 for surgery at LASUTH.
