Kogi State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governorship Campaign Council said it has uncovered a plot by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to influence the postponement of Saturday’s election in the state in collusion with the state government. PDP in a statement on Tuesday by the Deputy Director, Public Communication, Comrade Austin Okai, alerted the people to the alleged subtle moves by the APC and the state government to have the election shifted by two weeks. “The outgoing government of Yahaya Bello, having realised that he will be beaten to the third position in the weekend election, if INEC goes ahead with the election, is working assiduously to have the election shifted by two weeks,” he said. He said the feelings of the people of the state were already averse to the misgovernance of the present administration, and sending jitters as to the possibility of securing victory at the poll. The PDP campaign council, therefore, appealed to INEC not to concede to any “unholy moves” by the APC that would jeopardise the expectations of the people of the state against installing good governance. According to him: “The teeming supporters and voters across the state have travelled from far and near to enable them elect the candidate of their choice as the next governor of Kogi State, and cannot afford to be disenfranchised on the altar of inordinate ambition to return as kogi governor by Yahaya Bello. “We enjoin INEC to go ahead with the election to usher in a brand new administration into Kogi State.”
