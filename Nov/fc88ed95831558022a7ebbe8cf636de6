Olalekan Okusan  Rose Odusanya is aiming to set a new record at the annual Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup as the women’s singles defending champion looks to win for her fifth consecutive title at the 51st edition of the longest running table tennis tournament in Nigeria, which comes up later this month. Odusanya, who is yet to convince the national handlers to be invited to the national camp told NationSport yesterday that she is poised to shield away anybody that may want to claim her title having won the trophy for four years in a row in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. “I don’t see anybody stopping me again this year because I have become a de facto champion of the competition. I started my training for the championship early because I don’t want to be caught unaware by any unknown player this year. Like Odusanya, men’s singles champion David Fayele is not ready to relinquish his title as the tournament serves off later this month. Fayele, who defeated Olajide Omotayo to become the champion, is aiming to hold on to the title in his bid to work his way into the national senior team. The Nigerian Army officer said nobody can halt his dream of carting home the highest prize this year. “My training began few weeks ago because my aim is to show the national handlers that I can be part of the national team. Also, I want to show people that my claiming the title ahead of Italy-based Omotayo was not a fluk,” Fayele said.
