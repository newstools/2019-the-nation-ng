 THE Adamawa State Police Command confirmed on Tuesday the killing of their men by suspected kidnappers in Mubi, a commercial town north of the state capital Yola It was learnt that the two operatives were killed on Monday night by gunmen who ambushed them around Gyella Road, in Mubi South Local Government Area. A report quoted local sources early yesterday as saying that two police officers might have been killed and six residents kidnapped when some gunmen attacked police and civilian vehicles on Gyella Road. The police command, however, said that nobody was kidnapped in the course of the Monday night attack. Dismissing the kidnap report, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Nguroje, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), confirmed the killing of the two policemen. Nguroje said in a telephone interview last night that some police officers on general patrol saw a certain man wandering around a bush path and considering the atmosphere of the man curious, the officers approached him. He said: “From the explanation the man gave, the officers found that he had just escaped from kidnappers. The officers then reached the decision to move into the bush to route out the said kidnappers.”
