Between road users in Lagos and the policemen deployed to manage the traffic situation in the city, it is different strokes for different folks. While commuters are lamenting the bad conditions of the roads, the policemen are laughing all the way to the bank as they reap heavily from the situation. Determined to make the most of the chaotic traffic situation, the errant policemen have hit on the idea of hiding in a corner to watch out for drivers that would veer into the lane of oncoming vehicles in a non-demarcated access road in Ilupeju area of the city. They demand sums ranging between N20,000 and N40,000 after threatening to drag their victim to the mobile court where they will be made to cough out N70,000 as fine.
