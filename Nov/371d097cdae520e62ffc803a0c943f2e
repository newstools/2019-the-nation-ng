 A TIPPER truck has crashed into eight commercial motorcycles in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, causing injuries to eight people. The incident reportedly happened on Tuesday evening. Police issued a statement on it on Wednesday morning. There were wild speculations of deaths. A version of the incident said the tipper driver lost control while fleeing bribe-demanding policemen. Another account said the driver was rushing off to avoid arrest because it was carrying contraband rice. The incident clearly caused much traffic inconvenience on the usually busy Jimeta or Veniklang Bridge, more commonly called Hayin Gada, but mention of two to 20 deaths appeared to be baseless. In its own version of the incident in a text message to our correspondent on Wednesday morning, Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said, “On 12/11/2019; one Abubakar Ahmed, a rider of tricycle Reg No JAD 051 VV, along Veniklang Bridge, had a self-accident as a result of tyre burst. “When policemen from Central Motor Traffic Division visited the scene to render the victims first aid and clear the road of obstruction, hoodlums attacked the police patrol vehicle, which resulted into traffic congestion. “There and then, a tipper with reg no KTG 12 XA, driven by one Musa Mohammed, lost break and hit eight tricycles where eight persons sustained injuries.” He added that the injured had been taken to hospital and that the police command was able to bring the situation under control. He urged members of the public to avoid further speculations, assuring that the police had commenced full investigation and all those found wanting will be dealt with in accordance to established legal procedure.
