AN Ogudu Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday remanded a 39-year-old security guard, Ojo Apejua, who allegedly  defiled his 12-year-old stepdaughter. The Magistrate, Mrs Ejiro Kubeinje, who did not take the plea of the defendant, ordered that the case file be sent to the state director of public prosecutions for advice. Kubeinje adjourned the case to January 9, 2020. The defendant, who resides on Salawe Street, Ikosi, Ketu, Lagos State, is facing a charge of rape. Earlier, the prosecutor,  Inspector Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on October 10 at 10pm  at his residence. Ihiehie said the defendant had been defiling the girl since September and had threatened to kill her if she told anyone. “On that fateful day, he was caught red-handed  by the  girl’s mother. “He left the house since that day but was later arrested by the police,” Ihiehie said.
