The family of a 13-year-old girl, who was reportedly raped until she lost consciousness, is seeking financial support to offset her medical bills. The teenager was allegedly raped by her stepfather, identified as Sunday Ojo, on October 16, 2019. The incident was said to have occurred at the White House area of Jakpa Road in Effurun, Uvwie council area of Delta State. The Nation gathered that 51-year-old Ojo has been in hiding since the act. He had allegedly beat the young girl after molesting her, then tried to drown her. The victim’s mother, who was absent due to a quarrel with the suspect, who is her husband, on the night of the incident, returned the following morning to find her daughter sprawled on the floor, with blood stains. It was learnt that she rushed the child to Central Hospital, Warri, then to a private clinic, were the young girl finally regained consciousness, after seven days. Narrating the ordeal, the mother said, ”l left the house that night because of the misunderstanding I had with my husband who had at one point stabbed me on my left elbow. ”I returned the next morning but I could not gain entrance into the house, until I called my brother and we broke into the house. “It is true that the stepfather raped my daughter. The victim, said to be relatively stable, has been billed N1.8 million for her medical treatment. The family has paid N800,000 and is seeking support from the public to complete the payment and get the child back to school. “Please, I want the public to help me financially, to take my child home. We are here because we couldn’t pay the balance money,” Mrs. Matthew appealed. Delta State police confirmed the incident. Commissioner of Police Adeyinka Adeleke told The Nation on the phone that they were “yet to arrest the man.”
