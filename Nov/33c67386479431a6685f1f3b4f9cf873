The defendants were arraigned at about 4:12 pm on a one-count charge of engaging in amorous gay relationships. Each defendant pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting counsel Mr J.I Ebhoremen applied for a remand of the defendants in prison custody. But defence counsel, Mr Israel Usman, opposed him. Usman informed the court of a bail application, praying it to admit the defendants to bail, pending trial. He attached a 47-paragraph affidavit in support as well as a further affidavit, and a written address, in urging the court to grant the defendants bail. The prosecutor also informed the court of a counter-affidavit, opposing the defendants’ bail. In a bench ruling, Justice Mohammed Aikawa held that although the charges against the defendants were serious, they were bailable. He said bail can only be denied following the circumstances spelt out by law, adding that in the instant case the offence for which they are charged does not attract the capital punishment. He granted each defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in the like sum, one of which must be a civil servant of grade level 10 and the other with a reasonable means of income to be verified by the court. The court held that each of the defendants shall sign an undertaking not to delay the trial. He held that pending perfection of their bail, they shall be remanded in police custody for 48 hours, and, if after the period they fail to meet the bail condition, they shall be transferred to the prison custody. After the bail, defence counsel immediately applied to the court for a variation of the bail condition but the court held that it was only where the defendants are unable to meet the bail conditions that an application for variation will be necessary. The case continues on December 11 and 12 at 2 pm each day. The police alleged that the defendants were arrested at a Hotel in Egbeda on Aug. 25, 2018, adding that they were picked up at 2 am while performing gay initiation rites for newly recruited members. They were first arraigned before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. They had all pleaded not guilty to a three-count charge of conspiracy, membership of a secret cult, and unlawful gathering. Chief Magistrate Kikelomo Ayeye had admitted them to bail in the sum of ?200,000 each, with one surety each in the like sum. The police, however, filed a count charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court. In the charge marked FHC/1/311c, the police alleged that the defendants made “public show of a same-sex amorous relationship with each other in hidden places within Kelly Hotel” Egbeda.
