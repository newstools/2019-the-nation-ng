 Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will today perform the ground-breaking of Railway Wagon Assembly Plant in Kajola, Ogun State. He would be accompanied by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi The Presidency announced this on Wednesday through its verified twitter account @NGRPresident. It said the Transportation Ministry, on behalf of the Federal Government, in March 2018, signed an agreement with the Chinese rail contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), to establish the wagon assembly plant. Rolling stock would be produced at the plant to make it easy for the government’s ongoing railway modernisation projects. The plant is expected to produce some of the wagons that will be used on the Lagos-Ibadan, Abuja-Kaduna, Itakpe-Warri rail operations, and for other railway projects. After completion and commencement of production, the plant is expected to employ nearly 5,000 Nigerians. As demand increase for rolling stocks, the capacity of the plant will be expanded to include, in the first phase, assembly of coaches and locomotives. The project will serve as a catalyst for national economic growth and development as enshrined in Federal Government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). It will also boost local capacity for production of materials and products underpinned by Presidential Executive Order No. 5.
