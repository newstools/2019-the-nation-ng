Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has warned opposition parties against alleged plans to import thugs from other states to unleash terror and disrupt next Saturday’s governorship election in the state. Bello, who is also the candidate of the ruling APC in the November 16 governorship election, gave the warning in Ayingba, at the weekend, during the Dekina/Bassa Federal Constituency rally of the party ahead of the poll, saying that no amount of evil and sinister plans could hamper the integrity of the process. He warned that anyone caught fomenting trouble would be made to answer to the law. According to him: “It is only a bastard that will invite a foreigner to come and kill his people because of election. “Please, do me a favour- youth, women and residents of Igala kingdom- you know yourselves. Do not take the law into your hands. We are not unaware of their plans to import into Kogi State mercenaries from Port Harcourt (Rivers), Nasarawa, Ekiti, Kwara, Taraba and Agatus from Benue State. “I am assuring them, if they have ever succeeded in doing that in other states, Kogi State November 16 governorship election will be an exception and it will be the last state they will ever intrude to cause mayhem during election. We are resolute to maintain and sustain the existing peace in the state. “The forthcoming election is about the future of the people of the state and I am optimistic that APC will win the election conveniently, because the youths and women in the state have said no to political godfatherism, where governance is being transferred from father to son, from in-law to another in-law.” He said if re-elected, his second term would witness tremendous achievements, especially in the area of youth empowerment; to engage them meaningfully to have a brighter future. “Our second tenure will focus on human capital development, education, security and infrastructure development to improve the living standard of the citizens,” Bello said.
