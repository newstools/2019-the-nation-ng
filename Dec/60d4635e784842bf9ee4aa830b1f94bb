Super Eagles German coach Gernot Rohr has dismissed claims he prefers Reading FC midfielder Ovie Ejaria to Queens Park Rangers forward Eberechi Eze for the national team, saying  he has not granted any interview to any media organization both locally and internationally on the issue. Rohr cleared the air on the Super Eagles Twitter handle: “My attention has been drawn to some statements online that I have described Reading FC player Ovie Ejaria as a better player than Queens Park Rangers’ Ebere Eze and so the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) should get him in the team immediately. This is totally false and very disrespectful to both players. I never compare players and I have not asked the NFF to make any approach for the players in question. “I will never ask the NFF publicly to approach any player for our team. We have our processes and it certainly doesn’t include sharing such information publicly. “Furthermore I think there must be restraint in press statements purportedly quoting me and my person in terms of interviews. “I share a very good relationship with the media in Nigeria but this must not be abused to the extent of misquoting me and making wrong claims about my person,” noted Rohr.
