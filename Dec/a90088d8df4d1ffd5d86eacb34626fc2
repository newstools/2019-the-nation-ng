 Despite losing 3-0 to Abia Warriors on Sunday, the chief coach of Plateau United Football Club Abdu Maikaba has revealed that his target in the on-going Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) is to finish in the top three at the end of the season and qualify for continental championship. Maikaba while explaining the current success of the team said maintaining the top spot in league (NPFL) was as a result of quality players recruited before the season started. The former Akwa United tactician stated that players in the team have imbibed his philosophy and they are ready to fight till the end of the season barring injuries. “What I can assure you is that the players are fully ready for the matches. I recruited the players and I know their capabilities. My players are experienced and talented. This is new Plateau United with new vision and mission. The club’s management have equally key into our vision of making it to the continent next season. The team is an old club and deserves to represent the country. As I always say the target is to finish top and we have resolve to do it together,” Maikaba added. He, however, stated that there would be stiff challenge from the traditional clubs like Enyimba, Kano Pillars, Akwa United and Rangers International despite their poor start.
