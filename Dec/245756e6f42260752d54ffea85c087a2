Yes, she can do more! But when it comes to advocacy, Kwara State First Lady, Olufolake Abdulrasaq, has been giving her best. Recently, she led thousands of women on a street walk against gender-based violence and sexual abuse in Ilorin, the state capital, calling for mass support against the scourge. The rally, which began at the Kwara State Banquet Hall, saw the women walking through the popular Ahmadu Bello Way through to Challenge, Post Office, Sulu-Gambari Road and back to the starting point. They carried placards with inscriptions like Stop Child Abuse, Walk Against Rape, End Rape, Keep Hope Alive, and Kwara Says No to Domestic Violence. Tagged ‘Count me in, together we move Kwara forward,’ Mrs AbdulRazaq said the advocacy walk was to create awareness on the prevalence of gender-based violence with a view to stemming the tide.
