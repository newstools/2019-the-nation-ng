 SUPER Eagles striker, Kelechi Iheanacho scored a last minute goal in Leicester City’s 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday at the King Power Stadium to propel his team to second spot on the Premier League log behind Liverpool. Iheanacho who had not scored a Premier League in over a year before yesterday also provided the assist for Jamie Vardy’s goal, which brought Leicester level after Brazilian striker; Richarlison had put Everton ahead in the 23rd minute of the explosive encounter. The Nigerian striker ran into space to meet Ricardo Pereira through ball, all the while staying onside to deliver the killer blow that may see Marco Silver losing his job at Everton. He celebrated his goal and seemed to be saying a prayer when VAR was reviewing it. After the goal was confirmed, his team mates and the technical crew led by Coach Brendan Rogers ran to the Iheanacho to celebrate with him as the  former  Golden Eaglets’  star relished  the moment by  pumping his clenched fist into the air. Iheanacho, who also scored the first VAR goal in England said in a post-match interview alongside his strike partner Vardy that he stayed onside to collect the pass and score the decisive goal, adding that he knew the goal will stand. “I knew it was a goal even when we had to wait for VAR to confirm it. I stayed o side throughout and it was exciting to get the goal,” Iheanacho added. Iheanacho, who joked that he should be called Mr VAR, said he has been training hard despite not getting a chance to play in the team and said he knew a day like this would come for him to show what he can do. “I’ve been waiting for this opportunity and I knew one day it will come. I’ve been working hard in training every day to make sure I keep up to the standard so I’m happy today to get a goal and to assist Jamie. I’ve had to be mentally strong,” he noted.
