PERMANENT Secretary of the Ministry of Sports, Adesola Olusade has said N850m government counterpart funding for the 2018 Africa Athletic Championship was not released due to the inability of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Local Organising Committee (LOC) to present their expenditure and deficit documents. Olusola said the presentation of the documents would have aided the release of that fund after the successful completion of the championship. He also explained that $150, 000 released by Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) according to records in the Ministry revealed that the bulk of the money was spent between May and August 2017, but the other was spent in 2019 without any reference to the Ministry, adding that it was paid into a private account in 2018. He said it is pertinent to clear these issues in the event of unfolding happenings in the AFN. Also, acting President of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Olumide George has been urged to see his position as a call to national service and not one to build an empire for himself. The representative of the minister, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Adesola Olusade, who stated this yesterday while receiving the acting president and his team, said there is need to review all obnoxious clauses that reserves exclusive powers on an individual like the President to unilaterally convene meetings without recourse to Board members. He advised that wisdom should be applied to ‘’review and improve on the prevailing constitution of the AFN, adding, national interest and determination to assist Coaches and Athletics to attain podium performances at competitions should be uppermost in their activities.
