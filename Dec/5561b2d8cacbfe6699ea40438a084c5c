Abdulwasiu Mujeeb reports  THE Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto (UDUS), has approved three new courses for its Faculty of Law. This was disclosed by the Dean of the Faculty, Prof. Mufutau Rufai, in a telephone conversation with CAMPUSLIFE. Prof. Rufai said the approval, secured a few months ago, would benefit only year four and five students. He added that the new courses would be in aspects of criminal procedure, civil procedure for final year students and research methodology for 400-Level students.  Rufai said the move was perfected in a way to help students with the challenges they often experience while in the law school. “Though we encountered some challenges while seeking the approval, but we just think that the new courses should be introduced to our students, so they won’t be affected when they get to law school,” he said.
