The General Manager of LASWA, Oluwadamilola Emmanuel, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the inspection was to guarantee safety of passengers during and after the Yuletide. Emmanuel said that the authority knew that boating and fun-seeking activities on waterways would increase during the season, hence the need for inspection of boats and life jackets. “There is the need to step up safety procedure on waterways in line with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commitment towards development of water transportation. “LASWA as an organisation is constantly engaging and sensitising the waterways stakeholders, most especially on adherence to safety standards on our waterways. “Currently, we are carrying out boat inspection and life jackets buoyancy test across all jetties and terminals in Lagos State to guarantee safety of passengers during and after the Yuletide,” he said.
