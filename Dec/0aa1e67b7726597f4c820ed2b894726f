 PRESIDENT of “Build A School In Africa” (BASIA), Dr. Victor Ukorebi, has urged parents to enrol their children and wards of school age to give them effective education. He said it is the right of every child to be an educated in order to have a good future. Ukorebi spoke at the inauguration of a new block of four classrooms, two renovated blocks of six classrooms, a borehole and eight rooms of modern toilet facility at St. Peter’s College, Olomore, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The project was the initiative of BASIA, in conjunction with Latter-day Saints Charities and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. “Our children belong to the classrooms and not on the streets. They deserve education and not hawking and idling away. Each child is a potential future leader of this state and this country. Getting the right education will only get them closer to that dream and aspiration, and to place them in their rightful positions in the society,” he said. The group, led by Dr. Ukorebi and his wife, Katia, also visited Ogun State Deputy Governor Noimot Salako-Oyedele. The deputy governor lauded the initiative as well as applauded the gesture of giving back to the society. Mrs Salako-Oyedele said the group’s effort had brought hope to the people and put smiles on their faces. She said the Dapo Abiodun administration would continue the partnership with BASIA and Latter-day Saint Charities to reduce the suffering of the people in getting clean drinking water and reducing the number of out-of-school children.
