I received the list of the logistics needed to ease work and promised to make them available”. In fulfilling the pledge, Ibeman, as fondly called by his admirers said “last week Monday, I promised to provide work tools that will aid seamless registration of applicants at National Identity Mgt. Centre in Ota; today, it’s a pleasure to donate 1 Generator, 2 Monitors, Spectranet Modem with 60GB data, UPS, Scanner and other accessories needed to increase the number of applicants attended to per day. “Currently, the centre at the Local Government Secretariat attends to an average of 100 applicants per day, with our intervention, the number will double. This is part of our efforts in making life easier for our people especially our young ones who need the NIN for their UTME registration”. He, however, charged management of the Centre to put the items in good use by ensuring their effective maintenance.
