By Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan The embattled council bosses sacked by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Wednesday pushed aside their rivalry and grudges to celebrate the governor on the occasion of his 52nd birthday. The sacked chairmen under the aegis of Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), Oyo state chapter conveyed the congratulatory message in a statement issued by its chairman, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye. The statement reads in part, “As you deservedly mark this birthday anniversary, it is our prayer that Almighty God will continue to grant you good health as He guides, guards and prospers you in the many more years of fulfilling service to our dear state. “As a recent beneficiary of the rule of law and as a Statesman and Father of all, ALGON wishes to advise that you should always toe the path of rule of law, this is the line of honour and maturity for the sake of grassroots development of the pacesetter state and democracy in general. “We wish your Excellency Happy Birthday and Season’s Greetings.”
