THOUGH not known to many, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and his Imo State counterpart, Emeka Ihedioha, were best of friends until recently when their friendship was torn apart by disputed oil wells between the two states. Long before the presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on October 7, 2018, the two had been very close friends with Ihedioha regularly visiting Wike in Port Harcourt. Although Wike supported Aminu Tambuwal in the primary election while Ihedioha supported Atiku who eventually won the ticket, the election did no harm to their friendship even though Wike was not happy about the outcome. Those who know said the two continued their friendship from where they stopped and Ihedioha kept seeing Wike while Wike also gave him a huge moral support to become the governor of Imo State. To Wike’s surprise, however, the first step Ihedioha took when he became governor was to demand that some oil wells ceded to Rivers State should be returned to Imo. The move was said to have left Wike wondering if that was Ihedioha’s way of rewarding Rivers state for the moral backing the state gave him to become Imo State governor. Wike was said to be particularly peeved that Ihedioha did not even accord him the courtesy of mutual discussion of the issue before it was made public, knowing full well that they are not only friends but neighbours. Of course, Wike is not one who would want the assets of Rivers State ceded to another state, knowing that it was an issue on which Rivers State once fought Bayelsa and won. Those who should know say Wike now sees Ihedioha as a dangerous friend  and  lmo as a dangerous neighbour.
