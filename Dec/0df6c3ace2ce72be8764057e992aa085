Mikel Arteta has named his coaching team at Arsenal, with Freddie Ljungberg confirmed as one of three assistants. Arteta left his post as Manchester City assistant manager, working under Pep Guardiola, last week to succeed Unai Emery as Arsenal head coach. Ljungberg, who took interim charge of the team for six matches, remains as an assistant coach alongside Albert Stuivenberg and Steve Round. Stuivenberg is currently Ryan Giggs’ assistant manager with Wales and will combine duties with Arsenal until after the European Championships in the summer. He previously worked with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. Arteta has also brought in Round, who was part of David Moyes’ backroom staff at Everton and Manchester United. Round has also worked in the England coaching set-up and held a role as director of football at Aston Villa. Inaki Cana Pavon comes in as goalkeeping coach from Brentford to work with Sal Bibbo. Pavon previously worked in Spain and Denmark after starting his playing career at Barcelona.
