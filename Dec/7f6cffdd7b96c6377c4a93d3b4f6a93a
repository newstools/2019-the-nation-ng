A Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Samuel Agwameseh, has been freed by his abductors, Delta Police Commissioner Adeyinka Adeleke has said. The victim is the parish priest of St. Lawrence Catholic Church, Issele-Mkpitime in Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. He was kidnapped last Saturday by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen while returning from Onicha-Olona where he had gone for the production of the church’s weekly bulletin. The kidnappers demanded N20million ransom. Adeleke, who confirmed the release of the cleric, said he was unaware of the payment of ransom. He said: “The priest has been released, but I’m not aware if ransom was paid or not.”
