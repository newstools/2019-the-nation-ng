A Federal High Court, Lagos heard on Thursday the laptop retrieved from embattled musician Azeez Fashola a.k.a Naira Marley during investigation, does not show either it was used for crime or not. An operative of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuru Buhari, stated this while under cross extermination by Naira Marley’s counsel Olalekan Ojo (SAN) before Justice Nicolas Oweibo. Asked how he accessed the laptop without the owner’s password, Buhari replied that as a cyber-crime hacker he doesn’t need to know the password of any person to access their laptop because it was part of his training. Buhari, however, answered in the negative when Ojo also asked him if he remembered the manufacture date of the Naira Marley’s laptop. The court overruled EFCC counsel,  Rotimi Oyedepo’s attempt to ask his witness to clarify what he meant by not knowing when the laptop, tendered in evidence as exhibit P1, was manufactured. Justice Oweibor adjourned the case until February 27 and 28, 2020.
