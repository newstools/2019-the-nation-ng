 THE Federal Government has insisted that all teachers in the country must register before the December 31 deadline set by the National Council on Education. The teachers, it said, must register and get certified by the Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) or get booted out of the system. TRCN’s Registrar and Chief Executive, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, stated this in an interview in Abuja. Ajiboye said the council had successfully registered over 2 million teachers while about 1.8 million of them had been captured in a clean databank, following the initial crash of the council’s database. The chief executive said the era of using teaching job as political patronage was over, adding that al those who are not qualify to teach in the nation’s schools would be weeded out. He said: “Deadline was set at that time and certain things were put in place, especially for those who were not qualified, because the fear was about those who were not qualified, to be able to correct their deficiencies.  “You can do Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE). The National Certificate in Education (NCE) also approved for TRCN to run in institutions what they call Professional Diploma in Education (PDE), for those who were not qualified to enrol for either the PGDE or PDE, to balance their degrees in cognate areas.”
