Tijani, of 14, Adeeyo Street,  Ifo, Ogun State and Adekunle, who lives at 3, Arike Akinbami Street, Meiran, Lagos are facing a three-count-charge of conspiracy, forgery and impersonation before Chief Magistrate Mrs. T.

He told the court that the defendants committed the offences on December 1, at 9am at Fagba on Iju Road, Agege, Lagos.

Chief Magistrate Ojo granted them N100,000 bail each with two sureties each in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and have evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Ojo ordered that the sureties must be relations of the defendants and live within the court’s jurisdiction. The case was adjourned till January 16.
