 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the newly crowned, two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, as the emblem of a true Nigerian. The APC, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said Joshua, who reclaimed the number one world boxer’s throne, six months after he lost same position to the same opponent, Andy Ruiz Jr., had depicted the typical Nigerian spirit. According to him, the APC, as the ruling party, seeking to espouse the virtues of resourcefulness, hard work, self-belief, and patriotism in Nigerians, is most delighted to be identified with Anthony Joshua, who through the steadfast and positive spirits had shown the Nigerian can-do spirit to the word. “The All Progressives Congress congratulates Nigerian-born Anthony Joshua on becoming a two-time world heavyweight champion, following his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr. in a tense rematch in Saudi Arabia. “With Anthony Joshua’s boxing career suffering a major setback following a shock defeat to Andy Ruiz six months ago, he approached the disappointment with positive spirit. We are not surprised by Anthony Joshua’s deserved and stunning comeback victory which saw him retake the IBF, WBA, IBO and WBO titles. “Anthony Joshua now joins a small cluster of men, including Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Floyd Patterson, to have reclaimed the world heavyweight title.” “Anthony Joshua’s persistence and resilience represent the typical can-do spirit of Nigerians in the face of adversity. He is a man who is proud to be a Nigerian, doing his best in his calling to uplift the name of his fatherland. He rose to world best in boxing with determination, exhibiting the positive audacity for which Nigerians are known worldwide,” statement said.
