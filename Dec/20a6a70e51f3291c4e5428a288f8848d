 Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) elders on Monday reflected on grassroots governance, urging the elected 16 council chairmen and their councilors to live up to expectations. The elders said their election could only be meaningful, if they replicate the achievements of Governor Kayode Fayemi in their respective local government areas. In a congratulatory letter to the governor and his deputy, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, on the successful conduct of the local government polls, the ‘Ekiti State APC Elders Forum’ also hailed the State Independent Electoral Commission, led byJustice Jide Aladejana, for the credible polls. The letter was signed by the Chairman of the forum, Asiwaju George Akosile and Secretary, Chief Abiodun Ajayi, who advised the new chairmen and councilors to cooperate with the governor and party leaders in their bid to move the state forward.
