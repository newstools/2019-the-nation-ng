FOR secure the services of Emmanuel Dennis in January, Premier League clubs Manchester United, Leicester City, Brighton and Southampton must part with 30 million Euros for the Club Brugge forward. The English sides have all had scouts at the Jan Breydel Stadium this season to check Dennis, who recently extended his contract at Club Brugge until 2022. Last summer, Club Brugge received 25 million Euros from Aston Villa for Brazilian striker Wesley and reports have now suggest they could make even more with the sale of the 22- year-old, who has been capped once by the Super Eagles. Brighton, for one, has already done business with Club Brugge after they bought Mathew Ryan and Jose Izquiredo.
