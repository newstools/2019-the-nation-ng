 College of Education Academic Staff Union of Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (AOCOED-COEASU) on Tuesday began strike. The union accused the management of taking it for granted despite its patience and tolerance. Declaring the strike at the union’s secretariat, the Chairman of COEASU-AOCOED, Comrade Ige Ajayi, lamented that it was already three months that the union suspended its strike in order to give room for dialogue, to no avail. Ige listed some of the union’s grievances to include unpaid 53.37 per cent allowance and arrears, unfair redistribution of electricity on campus, non-revival of internally-generated revenue programmes, management’s inability to establish the college bookshops and inexplicable promotion criteria for academic staff, among others. However, the Registrar, Mr. Shehu Muhideen, said that the issue of bailout was the prerogative of the government, which had not yet responded at the time of this report.
