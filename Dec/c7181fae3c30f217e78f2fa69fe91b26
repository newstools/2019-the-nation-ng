Chairman of Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area of Lagos, Dr Funmilayo Akande-Mohammed has attributed the council’s self-reliant programme as part of reasons for the reduction of crime in the council. According to her, many youths are idle due to the absence of paid jobs before she assumed office. On assumption of office, she said several vocational skills acquisition programmes were evolved to get the youths busy. Akande-Mohammed spoke at a briefing to announce the completion of a new office complex and some roads. The projects, she said, are part of the numerous achievements to showcase during the celebration of her second year in office. The council, she said, had also empowered 100 physically-challenged persons with wheel-chairs, food items and cash to cater for themselves. According to her, the restiveness among the youths was so prevalent that heavily armed policemen were always invited to secure the council whenever there was an event. “Today, the story is different. We can now stage events without fear of harassment or molestation from any quarter. This is evidence of our effort to rid the community of hoodlums…” At the end of the programme, various empowerment items such as hand dryers, sewing and grinding machines, make-up boxes, deep freezers, among others were distributed to the beneficiaries on the day of their graduation,” she said. The council chief said much has been done to address the challenges of the people.
