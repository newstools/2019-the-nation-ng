Pioneer Dean of the School of Transportation of the Lagos State University (LASU-SoT), Dr Tajudeen Olukayode Bawa’Allah has urged Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to push ahead with initiatives aimed at encouraging public transportation. Bawa’Allah, in a statement on Monday presented to the governor on his 200th day in office, saying the administration must remain committed to “a corrective, directional, and people oriented public transportation, as this remains the way to correct the lapses of the past four years.” Bawa’Allah, a Fellow of the Academy of Engineers, and member of the Think Tank that drafted the state’s Transportation Policy, said his assessment of the administration in the last 200 days showed that the government is poised to return smiles back to the faces of the public with a policy that makes traffic management and transportation the centre piece of the administration and moving against “road lords,”at Oyingbo, Idumota, Ikorodu, Obalende, Iyana-Ipaja, Iba junction and Oshodi, which according to him has brought relief to the chaotic traffic congestion in that axis of the state. He praised the road repairs which are going on simultaneously across all the five divisions. He urged the governor to return to the drawing board and return the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (LAMATA), as the arrow head of the government’s intervention and infrastructure expansion. He said: “Let the governor bring LAMATA back to do what it was set up to do, providing Transportation Infrastructure and Integration of the Public Transportation systems, via road, rail, water and air in line with the state’s approved strategic masterplan.” Bawa’Allah praised the governor for also bring back the Fourth Mainland Bridge as part of efforts to expand the state’s infrastructure base and bring relief to the traffic congestion on the road
