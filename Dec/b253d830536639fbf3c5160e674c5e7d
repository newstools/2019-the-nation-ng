By  Olatunde Odebiyi  Chief Executive Officer Glittering Health Beauty, Kazeem Yayah, has launched his brand of make-up products called ‘Brow Daddy Yakky’. The product includes powder, foundation, eye shadow, bronzer and eye primer, among others. Speaking at the launch of the make-up line at his “Glittering Health Beauty” office in Ikeja, Lagos State, Yayah said the gesture was borne out of the need to contribute his quota and do more in the beauty industry in Nigeria. “We also have skincare products which I have been producing for about eight years now. All my products are more of organic and herbal  I use more of the Indian and Nigerian herbs, because the natural way of beautifying the skin is the best way to go,” Yayah said. He urged government to put regulations such as registration, certification and schools established to train people in place to promote the organic aspect of the beauty industry and also help to uphold professionalism in the sector. Yayah advised Nigerians to go for the right training on skin care in organic products, adding that they should embrace the natural way to beauty in a slow steady manner.
