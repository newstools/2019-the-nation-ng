The Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc (EEDC) has called on electricity consumers within its franchise area to be vigilant and ensure power installations serving them are protected from vandals this yuletide. Its Head of Communications, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, decried the rate at which power facilities were being vandalised across EEDC’s network, stressing that the menace was always high during the yuletide; and it is already being experienced. “No day passes without a case of vandalism recorded in three or more districts.” According to him, in recent times, millions of naira have been committed to replacing vandalised materials, a regular practice which has eaten deep into the company’s revenue. The effect of vandalism has untold consequences on electricity customers who depend on power to carry out their various business activities, as they are subjected to blackout and inconvenience before the material is replaced and supply restored. EEDC is, however, not relenting on its effort to reduce cases of vandalism through its strategic partnership with security agencies and vigilante groups. This collaboration is yielding positive result.  In some cases, investigations have led to the recovery of vandalised items from the residents of vandals. “These vandals are not spirits and do not operate in the air. They are human beings, our relatives, friends, neighbours and so on, who operate in the same environment. “We encourage you to say something once you see something. Report any suspicious movement around these power installations. Join hands with the EEDC to stop these vandals before they stop us” Ezeh added. In another development, Ezeh appealed to customers indebted to the company to pay their bills so they can enjoy supply during the yuletide, especially communities. “When customers pay their bills, we will be more efficient in our service delivery and that will translate to customer satisfaction”.
