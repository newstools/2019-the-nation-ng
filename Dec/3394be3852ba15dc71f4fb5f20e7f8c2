 FORMER Nasarawa United Head Coach Bala Nkiyu has revealed that he left the club due to refusal of the new club management to discuss fresh contract terms at the beginning of the new season after the Alan Cup pre- season tournament in Kano. The former Flamingoes coach said initially he was not willing to take the team to the pre- season tournament in Kano which the team won but decided to lead them after pleas by the former chairman. He said when the league season was about to kick off, he approached the new club chairman Ibrahim Osanga to inform him of his intention to leave if he was not ready to renew the contract he signed with the former management but he was not forthcoming. “You see as a senior coach I can’t work without contract. The contract I signed with the club is for one year and that expired at the end of last season but they wanted me to carry on without renegotiating for fresh contract which I declined.  But since I left no one has called me and I have not called anybody. For me, I can’t run after any club, any club that need my services should come to me.  For now i am not attached to any club. The former FC Abuja tactician further said that he was accused of being biased in the recruitment of players for new season without giving preference to the home boys. “Frankly I told them that Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) is not for inexperience players. You need experience and quality players to withstand the pressure. I recruited 19 players from premier league clubs but I was accused of leaving out the home boys. I wish them well and I pray for the club to pick up at the right time. Nasarawa United is a good club and I want them to get a continental ticket”.  Nkiyu said.
