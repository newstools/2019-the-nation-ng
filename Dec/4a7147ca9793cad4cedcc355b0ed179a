Some suspected members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) on Friday attacked the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi in Spain. Amaechi was attacked while attending a climate change summit in Madrid. The minister, who confirmed the attack in a tweet, said: “Some minutes ago, I was attacked by a few misguided Nigerians while on national assignment at a climate change event in Madrid, Spain. “They were quickly repelled by the Spanish police before they could do any harm. I am fine. I was not hurt. Thanks for your support and prayers.” Although the minister was silent on the identities of the attackers, a top aide said: “They were wearing IPOB uniforms, fez caps and flags. They were like a mob. “So far, it is safe to say suspected IPOB members. The Spanish Police will release the details after their investigation.” A former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu was also attacked by IPOB members in August in in Nuremberg, Germany. On August 17, IPOB ordered its members in 100 countries across the world to attack the governors of Ebonyi, Enugu, Abia and Anambra states if they were seen in any of the countries. It could not be immediately ascertained if IPOB has extended its mob action to all government officials.
