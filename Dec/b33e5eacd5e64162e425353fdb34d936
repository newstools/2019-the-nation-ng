 Preparations are in top gear for the ‘’Legacy: Next Generation Concert”,  an event designed to celebrate Nigeria’s music icons as well as to revive indigenous music. The event, which will hold next Thursday, at Continental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos State, is organised by Leketex Nigeria Limited. Some icons of the legends to feature at the event include: Tolu Obey-Fabiyi (Chief Ebenezer Obey-Fabiyi); Toyosi (King Sunny Ade); Seun Kuti (Fela Anikulapo Kuti); Musiliu Ishola (Haruna Ishola); Paul Play (I.

Southwest governors and notable traditional rulers are expected at the event, which will honour distinguished Nigerians and music legends. On the honours’ list are Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde; Reverend Esther Ajayi; Victor Olaiya; Ebenezer Obey; King Sunny Ade; Salawa Abeni and Dele Momodu with an award of excellence.  According to project coordinator Tolu Obey, the event is targeted at reviving and preserving the rich history and cultural values in music. “It is essential that we must not allow foreign music to overshadow our indigenous works,” he said. “This is why this development requires a collective support in actualising a sustainable growth in resuscitating Nigeria’s indigenous music. This will also influence the younger generation musicians to go in the positive direction in delivering meaningful and culture-laden lyrics to shape our society positively.” Obey said the development had enjoyed following from custodian of cultural values, corporate bodies and well-meaning Nigerians.
