Kehinde OLULEYE CULTURE enthusiast and former Director General of Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), Mrs. Omotayo Omotosho, is back in society. For a while, she had stepped back perhaps because she didnâ€™t find the kind of programmes that gingered her interest. But Madam Tourism,as she fondly became known after her sojourn in the corridors of NTDC, has found something that excites her in the things that Ekiti First Lady, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, has been structuring through culture and arts.  Thus, Omotosho will be on ground in Lagos come December 21 at Oriental Hotel in Lekki, Lagos, where she will be part of the great Saturday Fashion Controversy under the Africa Fashion Week programme.
