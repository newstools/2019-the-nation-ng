By Ebeledike Neenma  This piece stems from Mahatma Gandhi’s description of the seven social sins of the world. They include wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, religion without sacrifice, and politics without principles. Mahatma Gandhi believed that humankind was advancing in science much faster than our ability to understand the deadly consequences of unbridled technology, especially in the area of weaponry. Weapon technology keeps advancing faster than knowledge of  using it. Mahatma Gandhi sought to explain how human beings were being ruthless and wicked in the use of various devices. He argued that science was quite beneficial to man but without humanity it was dangerous and did not promote human advancement. He further explained that Science did not change our attitude, character or beliefs.  A researcher once noted   that science never did and would never have a heart. It has no humanity. The scientific method does not use any system of ethics or morality to determine its direction and goals. Humanity is the moral compass we need to guide us in the usage of technology. Thus, it is essential for us (as Christians) to deal with our fellow humans with humanity, irrespective of what the law says or what is expected of us.  •By Ebeledike Neenma Redeemer’s University, Mass Communication
