Our Reporter  Fuji Star Aare Sir Shina Akanni aka Scopido has joined the campaign against drug abuse among youths. The message is  contained in his new album: K.K.K (Kodun Kopo Kope), released last Monday under  Exotic Records, owned by Segun Adegbesan. The four-track album contains songs, such as Oriwa maje a ya were, Omorere ni mo fe je’, Motun gbe Orin na de, Oba Gafar Olatunbosun Tijani Akebaje (Alawowo of Awowo Kingdom ).  According to the musician, Oriwa maje a ya were is the special song against drug abuse  directed to parents to keep an eye on their children and make sure they do not get involved in drugs or join bad gangs. K.K.K is a follow-up to Orin Ope, released last year under the same label. Akanni said the album will further stamp his authority in Fuji music as confirmed by the late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister.
