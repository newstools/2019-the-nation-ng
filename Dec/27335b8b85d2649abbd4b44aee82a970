“We learnt in many ways in Accra and we are happy to be back with good memories. Our sponsors have been amazing and we appreciate their partnership with the club,” Okubena said. The Ikoyi Club Tennis Section boss stressed that there were plans to make the Christmas season exciting at the tennis arena of the elite club. The four–day event was fun-filled for the members such that one of the star players of the team, Kelvin Obiegbunam, was elated about the entire tourney, stating that the members would benefit from the trip and the Ikoyi Club tennis section management.
