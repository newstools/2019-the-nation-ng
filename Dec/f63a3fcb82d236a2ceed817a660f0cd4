Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri  Operatives of the Imo State Police Command on Saturday arrested Nigerian musician, singer, and music producer, Duncan Wene Mighty Okechukwu. A release issued by the state police command’s spokesman, Orlando Ikeoku, on behalf of the commissioner of police, Rabiu Ladodo, said Duncan Mighty was arrested over an allegation of fraud. The police accused the musician of duping the Imo State government under Owelle Rochas Okorocha to the tune of N11 million promotion deal, which was not respected. The statement reads, “Today, 14/12/19, operatives of the command arrested popular music artist Duncan Mighty on an allegation of fraud. “This followed a petition written by an upcoming rap artist M2, who claimed that the Imo state government led by Owelle Rochas Okorocha, through the office of the SA on Entertainment, entered into a deal with Duncan Mighty to manage, promote, arrange collaboration with other top artistes and sign M2 under Young Wealth record label owned by Duncan Mighty. As a result, an agreement was reached with a fee of eleven million naira (N11,000,000) was paid to him. “However, since collecting the payment, he refused to fulfil his own part of the deal. “Sequel to the petition, the artiste was arrested, and he affirmed having such agreement and collecting the fund, but said he can only refund the money if the contract is terminated, he was then released on bail on self recognition. “Consequently, a letter was received by the representative of the former governor, terminating the contract to enable him refund the money, and since then he absconded, and all efforts made to reach him proved abortive. “In view of the above, a warrant of arrest was issued, that led to his arrest at the early hours of this morning”.
