Enyimba recorded their first win in the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup courtesy of a second-half winner by striker Martins Usule against visiting San Pedro from Cote d’Ivoire. Usule hit target for the home team inside the Enyimba International Stadium in the 64th minute. This is his third goal in the competition. They next travel to Algerian club Paradou on December 29. Elsewhere, Enugu Rangers staged a late fight back, but it was not good enough as their CAF Confederation Cup campaign is now in tatters after they lost their second straight group game 4-2 at Al Masry of Egypt today. Rangers lost 3-1 at home to another Egyptian club, Pyramid FC, on the opening day of action in the competition. The Flying Antelopes’ looked dead and buried in Port Said after hosts Al Masry raced to a 4-0 win before the Nigerians fought back and pulled two goals back. Eziekwe Chinonso scored to make it 4-1 four minutes from time, before the Egyptians scored an own goal to give the score line a lot more respectability.
