 A non-governmental organisation, Community Life Project (CLP) -Reclaim Naija, has reviewed its activities for the outgoing year with members, sharing their experiences on how the NGO has impacted on their local government and local council development areas respectively. CLP is a non-political group with a mandate to ensure that the locals are constructively engaged with their local government officials. It carries out its activities via crusades, training sensitisations and workshops. At the event held at the Knightbridge Hotel, Ikeja Lagos, members spoke of how CLP has empowered them with knowledge on local government administration, empowerment, and how to put public office holders to task, among others. Speaking at the event, Mrs Adefunke Omoniyi Johnson, from Igando-Ikotun LCDA, said the programmes by CLP have helped her in meeting new friends across other local governments, where they shared experiences. “The programme has enhanced my interaction by making me bold to approach my local government officials to demand from them budget planning and the constituency project. We now monitor them unlike before when we could not talk, we now monitor them more,” she said. Similarly, Mr Lawrence Umeiheukwu, from Amuwo-Odofin LCDA, explained that the programme has brought positive change to his community, adding that their participation now engenders a good number of ongoing projects sited by the local government. Earlier, CLP Programme Manager, Francis Onahor, said the event was to review community participation of its members in local governance.
