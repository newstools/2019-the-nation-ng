Nigeria forward, Taiwo Awoniyi, has said he is not excited playing in the German League with Mainz 05. Awoniyi, 22, has played only 149 minutes in six Bundesliga games and has failed to find the back of the net. He told Brilafm that, “Every footballer wants to play and when you don’t get the game time you can’t be happy. “I don’t think I have completed 150 minutes yet, so there’s no way I am happy or satisfied. My injury also didn’t help the situation. “I have recovered fully and there are no more issues. However it was very difficult for me during that time and I am just glad to be back,” said Awoniyi. Awoniyi who was signed by Liverpool on August 31, 2015 for a fee of around £400,000 was immediately loaned out to FSV Frankfurt. He has also played on loan at NEC Nijmegen, Royal Excel Mouscron and KAA Gent, all in Belgium. Awoniyi represented Nigeria at the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup and went on to win the tournament, scoring four goals during the competition. He also represented Nigeria at the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand after winning the 2015 African U-20 Championship in Senegal.
