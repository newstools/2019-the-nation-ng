By Duku JOEL, Maiduguri Borno Governor Babagana Zulum has directed the payment of December salaries and pension to enable workers celebrate the Christmas Yuletide. According to a statement by the Governor’s spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, the salaries have started hitting workers and pensioners accounts from Tuesday. Gusau added that Gov. Zulum believes workers will make better preparations for the Christmas if their salaries are not delayed until the end of the month. According to him: “The payment was in line with the Governor’s consistency in the prompt payment of workers’ salaries which has never been in default. “Governor Zulum has always considered payment of salaries not as achievement but as payment of debt, in this case, government paying for services rendered by law abiding civil servants contracted to work. It is public knowledge that salaries of workers in Borno have regularly been paid before 26th of every month. “For December however, Professor Zulum, in line with a tradition of releasing salaries ahead of religious festivals, directed relevant government officials to ensure workers and pensioners were paid before 20th of December. “The Governor’s directive has been complied with and workers have started receiving credit alerts from their respective banks since Tuesday.” He said the governor wishes all Christians a wonderful Christmas, while assuring them of continued efforts in safeguarding lives and property of all in the state.
