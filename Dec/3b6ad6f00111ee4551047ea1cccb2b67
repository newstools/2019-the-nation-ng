An Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun State on Thursday sentenced a 26-year-old homosexual, Michael Kudowo, to 11 years for raping four male minors. Senior Magistrate Mr. Shotunde Shotayo ruled that the convict must serve the sentence at the correctional centre in Abeokuta, Ogun State, without any option of fine. He ordered that the four minors aged between 12 and 15 be taken to Borstal Training Institution, Abeokuta for reorientation. Kudowo, who lives at Ile-Ita, Ota, had pleaded guilty to the three-count charge of kidnapping, raping and having carnal knowledge of minors. Prosecuting Inspector Cynthia Ejezie had told the court that Kudowo committed the offences between August 2018 and December 2019 at Ile-Ita. Ejezie said Kudowo kidnapped the minors from locations in Sango-Ota, Mushin and Ijebu-Ode, and kept them in his home. The prosecutor said that Kudowo had carnal knowledge of his victims through their anus in his home. She said it was Kudowo’s landlord who discovered the incident after Kudowo had gone to work. The prosecutor said that when Kudowo was not around, the landlord interrogated one of the minors. She said that Kudowo was arrested after the landlord had reported the case at Sango-Ota Police Station. She said that Kudowo at the police station confessed and admitted to have committed the crime. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 214(1), 216 and 365 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006.
