The outgoing governor of Bayelsa  State, Seriake Dickon, has described the  recent  elections held in Kogi and Bayelsa states as a “political coup d’etat.” Dickson expressed displeasure  over the outcome of the  elections in both states when he paid a courtesy call on Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, at the Government House. He said: “My views and that of observers and all those who have had the opportunity to comment on what happened, not just in Bayelsa, but also in Kogi are all there and they  all unanimously said  that what took place was not an election or so-called.” He added: “In fact, we are now experiencing a new concept of civilian coup d’etat and I will credit that to the former President Goodluck Jonathan for  he was right. That’s the sort of thing that took place in Bayelsa and Kogi.”  Dickson  lauded the Court of Appeal for its judgement, which upheld the victory of Bala Mohammed as governor. He congratulated the governor, urging him to do more developmental projects in the state. Dickson said: “We congratulate you again on your victory at the Appeal Court, which did the right thing by upholding your victory as the governor of this great state. We in the PDP Governors Forum felicitate with you on this well deserved victory. We will continue to give you supports, we your colleagues are proud of you.” Mohammed said Dickson  did his  best in the recent election held in Bayelsa where the candidate  of the PDP,  Diri Duoye, lost to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) He said: “What happened at the election was not a lost, it is something that he has done his best and all of us have done our best. I know we are victorious, victory is already with us.”
