 House of Representatives member Babajide Obanikoro says he is impressed with the fans and organisation of the Lagos Saturday Boxing Show. Obanikoro, who represents the Eti-Osa constituency of Lagos in the House of Representatives, was at the 107th edition of the monthly boxing tournament at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Hall, Rowe-Park, and Yaba to cheer the boxers. Obanikoro praised the Lagos Boxing Hall Fame (LBHF), chaired by Olawale Edun, a former Lagos State Commissioner for Finance, for promoting the people-driven and well-organised initiative “The organization has been top notch and the fans have been well behaved,” Obanikoro told NationSport. “Kudos to LBHF headed by Edun. It is no mean feat to sponsor a tournament like this every month since 2009.” Dolapo Omole was voted the best boxer of the day award based on his outstanding performance in the one day tournament. In what was clearly the fight of the day, plucky Dolapo produced a brilliant display of boxing to win his 56kg grudge fight with Saheed Abdullahi by a unanimous decision from the ringside judges. The boxing extravaganza, which is the premier amateur boxing programme in Nigeria, is coordinated by Lagos Boxing Hall of Fame in conjunction with the Lagos State Amateur Boxing Association (LABA) and aims at discovering talents at the grassroots.
