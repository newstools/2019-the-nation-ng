As part of efforts towards attaining food security, the Acting Director General of Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi (FIIRO), Dr Chima Igwe has called on the relevant stakeholders to embrace technology and innovation as it will help in achieving the needed transformation of agricultural sector in Nigeria.
Igwe stated this in Lagos during the Annual Agricultural Summit organised by Nigeria Association of Agricultural Journalists (NAAJ), with the theme: “Bridging the Investment Gap in Agricultural through Information.”
He noted that transformation of the sector was a necessary vehicle needed to serve as agent for economic recovery and growth. According to FIIRO boss, “In the past few years, Nigeria and Nigerians experienced a sudden and significant drop in economic activities which led to the loss of the purchasing power of our currency, the Naira. Although Nigeria has been able to exit recession, the strangling effects might still be seen lingering with the possibilities of a relapse if the nation does not diversify.” In his presentation, Deputy Comptroller of Customs, Dera Nnadi, who represented the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (Rtd) said Nigerians need to produce what they eat to grow the economy.
Earlier in his opening remarks, the Commissioner of Agriculture, Lagos State, Prince Gbolahan Lawal, who was represented by Olushina Shobande, appealed to Nigerians to key into the Agricultural revolution of federal government so that more jobs can be created.
The Chairman of Elephant Group, Mr Tunji Owoeye pointed out that the border closure has been opening doors of opportunities for Nigerian farmers.
