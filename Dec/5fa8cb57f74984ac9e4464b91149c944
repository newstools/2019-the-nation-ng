Media reports have suggested that table-topping Tunisian club US Monastir will demand a transfer fee of around a million US dollars for Anthony Okpotu. The 25-year-old striker moved to Tunisia as a free agent after he cancelled his contract with Moroccan club Difaa El Jadidi. Okpotu has been linked with several top clubs including Egyptian giants Al Ahly and he could move as early as next month. He is the leading scorer in the Tunisian top-flight league with seven goals and two assists. He recently told SCORENigeria he has set a personal goals target of 15 goals. ‘Black Panther’ Okpotu has previously played in Libya, Morocco and Albania. His stints in Morocco and Albania were marred by injuries.
