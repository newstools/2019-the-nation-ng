Over 10,000 less privilege persons have benefited from the Kano State Government multi-disease community outreach across the five Emirates of the state. Director-General of the State Agency for the Control of Aids, Dr. Sabitu Shu’aibu Shanono, disclosed this during the closing of the exercise at Dakatsalle and Dumaji towns of Bebeji and Garin Malam local government areas, respectively. Shanono said the programme was designed to provide free health care and medication to less privileged in their respective domains for a period of three weeks. The agency’s director-general observed that during the exercise many people were discovered to be unknowingly living with dangerous ailments such as hepatitis, diabetes, hypertension and even HIV/AIDS.
He noted that if such conditions were not detected on time, they would have posed a serious threat to their well being and that of their families. He said the administration of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje invested over 16 percent of its total budget towards the development of the health sector, which scored the state best in terms of health care in the country.
Some of the beneficiaries of the programme expressed happiness and urged the government to sustain the programme to save the life of the poor individual at the grassroots.
