Since the surprise defeat of Governor Seriake Dickson-backed candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the recently concluded governorship election in Bayelsa State, the story about town is that the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri, lost to his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Chief David Lyon, because the latter had the backing of former President Goodluck Jonathan. That, however, is not the thinking of Governor Dickson, who was said to have told his close aides and associates that Jonathan was the least of his problem in the election because Diri’s defeat was masterminded by President Muhammadu Buhari. Dickson reportedly said without Buhari’s influence, it would not have been possible for the APC to secure within 24 hours a stay of execution of the Appeal Court judgment declaring that the party had no candidate for the election. Dickson was said to have argued that to secure the stay of execution order, APC needed a copy of the court judgment which it did not have. Lost on the governor, perhaps, was the allegation by APC that the judge who delivered the no-candidate judgment vanished into the Government House after delivering the judgment and became unreachable. Dickson is said to be peeved that Buhari could stab him in the back in spite of his disposition as the most loyal PDP governor to the President. He is also said to have accused an acclaimed national leader who is not in government but is well respected and influential of aiding his defeat after flying in a helicopter to meet with Lyon in Yenagoa on the eve of the election.
