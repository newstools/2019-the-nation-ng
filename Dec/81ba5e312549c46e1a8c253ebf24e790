 Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force) at the weekend began the demolition of illegal structures, shanties, kiosks and containarised shops at Marwa Waterside in Lekki, Lagos. According to a statement from the agency, the Chairman of the task force, Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, said the demolition is to pave the way for the building of a coastal road, which will serve as an alternative route to the Lekki-Epe Expressway and enhance free flow of traffic at the corridor. Egbeyemi said: “Illegal business operators like iron benders, mechanics, food/fruits vendors and others were served a seven-day ‘Removal Notice’ by the government to remove their property and vacate the area and it expired on December 19. Investigation shows that none of the occupants and business operators have any permit from the government, as miscreants smoke and sell Indian hemp as well as engage in prostitution around the premises. The task force confirmed that after the expiration of the removal order, the government still gave the squatters additional eight days grace to vacate the area before embarking on the clean-up exercise as well as clampdown on criminals disturbing law-abiding residents within Marwa waterside and the entire Lekki axis. Egbeyemi implored illegal occupants on any of the government land/property to vacate same, as it would not be business as usual across the state.
