ANDY Ruiz Jr is determined to avoid adding his name to the list of the heavyweight one-hit wonders whose reigns were swiftly derailed once they succumbed to the trappings of fame. Ruiz has splashed out on a mansion plus a fleet of cars worth almost three quarters of a million pounds since his stunning knockout win over Anthony Joshua in their first fight in New York in June. But the 30-year-old insisted memories of fighting debt and eviction during much of his early career have been enough to keep him firmly grounded ahead of their rematch tomorrow. Ruiz said: “I’ve been boxing since I was six years old and after all my hard work and dedication I’m just having fun. “I’ve been on so many rollercoasters and right now I’m enjoying life with my family – there’s nothing wrong with that. “The same people who were with me for my first fight are still around me now. I think that’s important because it keeps me humble and reminds me where I’ve come from and how I’m not going to change for anyone.” That Ruiz is adamant he will avoid an equally brief reign owes much to the bond he has struck with his trainer Manny Robles since they paired up in the wake of Ruiz’s first career defeat to Joseph Parker in 2016.
