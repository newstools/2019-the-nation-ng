One of the Nigeria’s celebrated boxers in the 1970s, Abayomi Adeyemi is in dire need of help as the 1972 Olympian and former Commonwealth champion has been down with ailment. According to news monitored online, the septuagenarian represented Nigeria at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand and he defeated Scotland’s John Gillan in the final of lightweight event to claim gold medal for Nigeria and he also competed in the men’s lightweight division at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The former pugilist is now senile and lives in abject poverty at his Akure residence in Ondo State as he has now been abandoned to his fate. On a visit to his residence at High School area in Akure, it was difficult to extract any information from him as he is suspected to be suffering from loss of memory. Some of his acquaintances who craved anonymity said the plight of heroes like Adeyemi was the reason some of the new generation athletes are pledging their allegiance to foreign countries and neglecting their father’s land. According to them, “Since his condition was like this, nobody from the state, federal levels even the sports council has bothered about his welfare. They appealed to government at all levels to help him by assisting him financially and medically.
