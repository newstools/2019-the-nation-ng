Henkel, a homecare product maker, has unveiled WAW Colour, a detergent, into the Nigerian market to help customers have an excellent washing experience with their coloured clothes. The  new product was unveiled in Lagos, during the company’s WAW Distributors’ meeting and review of its brand performance in the past one year, as well as plans for next year. The Chairman, Managing Director, Henkel Nigeria, Mr Rajat Kapur, said most of the decisions taken by the firm were done after extensive consumer research. He said the product will help clothes look sparkling clean and new each time they are washed. While assuring its business partners/distributors of continious drive for innovation, Kapur said the company  will not rest on its oars in delivering innovative products for customers and ensuring that its partners have great relationship with the company. According to him, the Henkel brand is known globally for quality and has increased its penetration through e-commerce, retail sales and others, urging other brands to act fast in order to keep pace with the new generation of consumers.  Kapur said: “The next generation that is coming is 10 steps ahead. Most of them seek convenience and speed. A lot of them are already comfortable staying at home and purchasing items online where they find more varieties at cheap prices.” Kapur said the firm had leveraged technology to drive its product and relationship with partners, noting that WAW is now the number two detergent brand in the country and it is working diligently to become number one. The Marketing Manager, WAW, Olumide Aniyi-Kaye, said the new product was created after extensive consumer research and immersion and its unique selling point was the technology used which is deployed to make sure that fabrics stay protected when they are washed with the detergent.
