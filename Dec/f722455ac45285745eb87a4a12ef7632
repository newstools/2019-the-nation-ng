BORUSSIA Monchengladbach stayed top of the Bundesliga in a dramatic finale, beating champions Bayern Munich 2-1 at home. Ramy Bensebaini scored an injury-time penalty as Borussia Monchengladbach beat Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich 2-1 in a thrilling top-of-the-table clash yesterday. Bayern, who lost at home to Bayer Leverkusen last weekend, dominated the first half but could not open the scoring until shortly after the restart, with Ivan Perisic on target with a fine finish. Their lead was short-lived at Borussia-Park, however, as Bensebaini’s header drew Gladbach level within 11 minutes to set up a gripping finale. Javi Martinez conceded a late penalty for fouling Marcus Thuram – and was sent off – with Bensebaini staying cool to beat Manuel Neuer and leave Bayern seven points behind leaders Gladbach. Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski missed early chances as Bayern made a bright start. Interim head coach Hansi Flick reshuffled his Bayern side when Corentin Tolisso went off injured and Perisic replaced the midfielder, makeshift left-back Alphonso Davies having shaken off an early blow to his knee. Yann Sommer made a fine save to his left from Muller’s 20-yard strike, before the goalkeeper was lucky not to concede when he misjudged Joshua Kimmich’s drive and recovered to stop the ball on the line. Perisic missed a good chance before half-time, but the substitute broke the deadlock in the 49th minute, swivelling to thump home from just inside the box with Sommer unable to keep it out despite getting his right hand to the volley.
