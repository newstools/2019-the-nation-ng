Wife of the Lagos State Governor Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has hailed the Inner Wheel District 911 for training and empowering 40 indigent persons. Speaking during the graduation held at the Vocational Centre, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu, represented by Mrs. Folashade Sulaiman, said the organisation’s mission at improving the lives of women and children was critical to the growth and development of the state. The training and empowerment, she said, demonstrated the act of giving, adding that it was a way to lift people out of poverty. The Chairman, Inner Wheel District 911, Mrs. Adejumoke Odulaja, said the event was a fulfilment of the promise made at the assumption of office, noting that it cost about N4 million. “Our star project is training and empowerment and today we are presenting the women, girls and boys who have gone through eight weeks of intensive training in vocations. They will be empowered to improve their standard of living. We have put so much into this project to make sure they can compete with others out there,” she said. The Project Chairman, Mrs. Kafilat Afodun, said that the training was intensive, adding that participants were introduced to vocations and entrepreneurship courses. “We engaged professionals who had distinguished themselves in their vocations to facilitate the training sessions,” she said.
