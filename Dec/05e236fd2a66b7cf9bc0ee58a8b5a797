The Lagos State Government on Thursday gave N4million to service providers of Children Living with Disabilities (CLWDs). The Commissioner, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, presented N200,000 each to 20 service providers. He said the gesture was to appreciated the service providers for ensuring that caring for CLWDs and protecting their rights. He spoke at the Correctional Centre for junior boys in Yaba, Lagos, during the presentation of money to the service providers and Christmas party for CLWD. The event also featured the presentation of gifts to some service providers and the CLWD, who had fun dancing, eating and drinking. Dawodu said the aim of the government was to create a level-playing ground where CLWD could thrive, prosper, reach their full development potential, become useful and contribute their quota to the growth and development of the society. He urged the general public to cater for the welfare and well-being of CLWD and not treat them with any form of discrimination or prejudice. “These categories of children are often likely to be among the poorest members of the population. They are less likely to attend schools, access medical services or have their voices heard in the society. Their disabilities also place them at a higher risk of all sorts of abuses and often exclude them from receiving proper nutrition or humanitarian assistance in emergencies. “CLWD are one of the most marginalised and excluded groups in the society, they face daily discrimination, lacking adequate policies and legislation and are effectively banned from realising their rights to healthcare, educational and survival.” The commissioner decried the act that CLWD were often overlooked and that there was a  perception that they only bring hardship to people, thus they are to be taken care of by government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
