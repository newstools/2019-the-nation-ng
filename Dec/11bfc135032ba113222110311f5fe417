The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday arraigned Mr. Malik Wakili for allegedly impersonating the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), and defrauding him of N3,106, 216. Wakili, who was arraigned on a three-count charge before Justice C. J. Aneke of a Federal High Court, Lagos, was alleged to have committed the offence in March. The EFCC told the court that Wakili conspired with Abdullahi Umar, said to be at large, “to fraudulently impersonate Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN), with intent to gain monetary advantage for yourselves.” The anti-graft body said “the defendant converted the total sum of N3,106,216, being the value of the Air-Miles Skywards Account Number EK248739282 of Mr. Babatunde Fashola with the Emirate Airline and which sum you reasonably ought to have known formed part of the proceeds of your unlawful activity, to wit: fraud.” The prosecution said Wakili acted contrary to sections 15(2)(a) and 27(1)(b) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and was liable to be punished under sections 15(3) and 22(3)(a) of the same Act. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty. Justice Aneke adjourned the case till December 17 to rule on the bail application filed on behalf of the defendant by his lawyer, Eubena Anedu. EFCC prosecuting counsel Uduak Kufre did not oppose the bail application. He urged the judge to impose conditions that will ensure that the defendant attends his trial. The judge ordered that Wakili be remanded in prison custody pending ruling on his bail application.
