The Nigerian institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), last week inducted 310 newly elected associates who passed the two months internship and other requirements of the institution. The event with the  theme: International Best Practice of Professionals, took place in Lagos. NIESV President, Mr. Rowland Abonta, charged the inductees on discipline and good conduct, stressing that they cannot be good Estate Surveyors & Valuers without the prerequisite character and discipline. “The hallmark of every professional body including ours is discipline and good conduct. I, therefore, imploy you to abide by the rules and regulations of the institution and avoid cutting corners,” he said. Abonta urged the inductees to also seek for advice of their sponsors on all professional issues. “I also call on sponsors of the new associates to play the required role of mentoring the candidates they sponsored in their professional development” The Guest speaker at the induction, Chief E. L. Etudo, in his speech, explained the importance of ethics to the inductees. “You are not an Estate surveyor & Valuer if you do not know the ethics of your profession. Today we are inducting new sets of Estate Surveyors and Valuers who will be operating in the Nigerian space and will be bound by Nigerian laws and code of conduct,” he said.
