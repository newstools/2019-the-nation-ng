Oyo/Osun Command of the Nigeria Customs Service seized 2,540 bags of 50kg foreign rice during the partial closure of the border, Comptroller Abdullahi Zulkifli has said. He added that the command generated N34.6 billion between January and November. Zulkifli spoke on Wednesday in Ibadan at the command’s end of year news briefing. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that other items seized include 12 used cars, 15 bags of sugar, 500 pieces of tyres, 40 bales of used clothes, 25 means of conveyance and 101 bags of Indian hemp. Zulkifli said the total Duty Paid Value (DPV) on the seized items stood at N142,896,113. He said the border drill exercise had assisted in promoting national security, curbing illegal migration, encouraging local farmers and increasing revenue generation, among others. The comptroller, however, said that some recalcitrant smugglers still devised other means of smuggling goods despite the partial border closure. He said most of the goods were concealed in trucks and vehicles meant for carrying out legitimate businesses and conveyance of commuters. Zulkifli said: “The command has been doing well in the area of revenue generation, having generated N34,686,875,967 from January to November, as against N21,954,286,381 generated in 2018.” He said the command made 313 seizures and arrested 24 suspects within the period under review. Zulkifli said 21 of the suspects were on administrative bail, adding that two had been convicted and one still in court. He hailed the officers and men of the command for working to achieve set goals. NAN reports that awards were given to three officers for performing well. The awardees are AC Amusan John, Officer in-charge of Igbeti outstation, CSC Adewole Moses, Officer in-charge of Operations and ASC Idowu Gafar, Officer-in-charge of Anti-fly patrol.
