She also ordered, “the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) should be informed for compliance.” Mr D.G. Dashe, Counsel to the suspect, had made two applications before the court to order the IGP and Kyari to appear before it to show cause why contempt charge should not be visited upon them for failing to produce Sambo dead or alive on Nov. 29 as ordered.
