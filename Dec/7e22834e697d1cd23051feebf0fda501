 Club Brugge forward David Okereke believes next year will be better than the outgoing one after he netted twice for his ninth league goal of the season for his Belgian League leaders in their 4-0 home win over Zulte Waregem on Boxing day. Okereke, a second half substitute in the game replaced his compatriot, Emmanuel Dennis in the 59th minute and he got a quick-fire double in the 61st and 64th minutes to help put the result of the game beyond the reach of Zulte Waregem. The striker whose last goal for Club Brugge was on November 2nd said he was happy to end his goal drought while hoping to get better next year. “It is always nice scoring goals again after a very long time but I know that I can do more in the games ahead,” Okereke noted. He continued: “I thank the technical crew for the opportunity and my teammates too for the support when I needed it most in the game. I know I can only get better.” On his recent lack of games, the former Spezia of Italy midfielder noted that he knew he must work harder to regain his place in the team. “I can’t really say that but we have a good team and you have to work hard to get a chance to play so I guess I just have to continue working and keep fighting.” The former Under 23 star has scored 11 goals from all competitions including nine in the Belgian League where Club Brugge is dictating the pace with 49 points from 20 matches. The Belgian League proceeded on the winter break yesterday and games would resume on January 18 with Club Brugge away to fallen giants, Anderlecht.
