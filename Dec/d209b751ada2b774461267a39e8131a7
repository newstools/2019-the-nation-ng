Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo –Olu on Wednesday flagged off the reconstruction of roads network in different parts of the state, urging residents to take ownership of the projects. The governor accompanied by his deputy Dr Kadiri Hamzat and other members of the state executive council flagged-off the Victoria Island, Lekki Traffic Circulation project on Oniru axis being undertaken by Lagos State Government and Access Bank under a Public Infrastructure Improvement Partnership (PIIP) arrangement, before moving to Ikorodu area of the state to flag-off the rehabilitation and upgrading of Ijede Road, phase 1, in Itamaga-Elepe Town, among others in Ikorodu Local Government Area. The governor while flagging off the projects said the partnership with Access Bank was part of the measure to solve traffic congestion and bring relief to Lagos residents. He said: “This flag-off is another milestone we have achieved through partnership with the private sector to deliver projects which will directly impact lives. “We came to this area about 4 months ago at a presentation at Four-Points and we told our partners that immediately the rain subsides, we would come back and start with the development of the Oniru axis into Victoria Island from Lekki. “I’m happy that within a short time frame, much work has been done. Today is the 4th of December, and, with the stoppage of the rains, work can now start immediately. “For me, my colleagues and our partners, it is a strong point that we deliver on our commitments.
