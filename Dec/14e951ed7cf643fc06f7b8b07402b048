 FIFTEEN persons were arrested, five vehicles and three motorcycles towed away as the government in Lagos fired the first salvo in the beautification of the stretch of Outer Marina, up to the frontage of the State House  Marina from the foot of Apongbon Bridge, in order to improve the aesthetics of the area. Speaking on the flag-off of the beautification process on Tuesday, the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello said those arrested were people who ignored the vacation directive of the State Government to all street traders and operators of commercial vehicles in the areas. He added that all those arrested have been handed over to the appropriate enforcement agencies for prosecution, just as the present administration is committed to giving the Outer Marina a major facelift to restore its greenery outlook and to meet up the smart city vision of the state. Bello said the project had started in earnest under the supervision of the State Parks and Garden Agency (LASPARK) as all the illegal structures dotting the areas have been dismantled and traffic was now moving freely in the Outer Marina area, which is a pointer to the determination to make life easy for residents of the state. The Commissioner stressed that the evacuation and enforcement operations were carried out earlier at the Outer Marina stretch Apongbon, CMS up to the State House Marina following the deadline of the marching orders issued to street traders, shanties, squatters and Commercial Vehicles around the area. According to him, “commercial vehicle operators in Marina should desist from dropping passengers or stopping at the foot of the bridge, rather they should do such at designated Parks in the area; also street traders seen around the area will be prosecuted, as well as miscreants and all those found loitering around the foot of the bridge.” Bello emphasised that as the beatification and Landscaping project had commenced, Lagosians should be rest assured that the operation is a continuous process and will definitely be extended to other parts of the state. He charged residents of Marina and its environs to be ready to take ownership of the site after the beatification exercise and to desist from any act of indiscriminate dumping of refuse but rather patronize registered PSP operators in their area.
