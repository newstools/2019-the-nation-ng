By Adeniyi Adewoyin Prolific movie maker Ani Amatosero has unveiled a mini-film village in Asaba, Delta State. Ani, who has shot over 10 movies, said the film village, Effixzzy Villa, is her contribution to Nollywood. “I am coming into 2020 with a bold step,” she said. “My dream is to take Nollywood to the height it truly deserves. Recently, I set up a fully equipped studio with state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to enable me contribute my quota to the development of this enviable industry, which has … placed Nigeria among the giants in world cinema. I named it Effixzzy Villa. “…movie makers don’t have to visit and disturb people in their various houses to shoot your movies anymore. You don’t need to go to the hospital to disturb the sick all in the name of shooting a movie because I have made it easy for producers in Asaba. I have two sitting rooms, a hospital ward, three standard bedrooms, two standard offices and a doctor’s office. “We also have a fast food restaurant inside the Villa. The hustle is real oh, my brother. And by the grace of God, people come there to shoot all the time. Sometimes all this is too heavy to carry. I need investors that will come and invest in this business.  She said the village is fully equipped and suitable for film production. “What I have will help filmmakers in terms of aesthetics and good decor.  Secondly, it saves time. And time to me is money. A movie that was budgeted for two weeks can be shot in 10 days or less because a lot of time has been saved. The time you use in moving from a police station set to a hospital set will be well spent on same place.”
