The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Niger State said on Wednesday that five people were killed in an accident on the Bida-Kutigi road in Bida Local Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a similar accident occurred on Tuesday at Bonu village along Lambata-Minna road, resulting in loss of five lives, while several people were injured. FRSC Sector Commander Joel Dagwa, in an interview with NAN in Minna yesterday, said 18 persons were involved in the crash – seven men, two women, three boys and six girls. He said nine persons were critically injured in the accident – three men, three boys and three girls- and were receiving treatment at the Kutigi General Hospital, while four people were not injured. Dagwa said that the accident involved a white Mitsubishi Canter registered as XB 104 RUW. He said that the accident occurred on Tuesday at about 0230 hours on the Bida-Kutigi road in Bida Local Government. The sector commander said the unit command received report of the incident as soon as it occurred. “Our patrol team visited the scene, which is along Bida- Kutigi road and did the operation with the police and members of the Red Cross Society,” he said. Dagwa said that the accident was caused by over-speeding. He said FRSC personnel in the outposts would monitor road users against overloading, dangerous driving and indiscriminate parking on the highways. He called on road users to adhere to traffic rules and regulations, to avoid accidents. “We have already embarked on a 24-hour patrol on the federal highways to ensure safety of road users by enforcing traffic rules and regulations,” Dagwa said. He appealed to residents to always report crashes, as doing so would enable patrol officers to save lives.
