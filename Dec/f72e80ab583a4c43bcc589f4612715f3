As the year winds down, the School of Engineering of Yaba College of Technology recently played host to her first alumni reunion, held amid pomp and ceremony, at Finicky Hall, Jibowu, Yaba, Lagos. Old students turned up from far and wide in numbers to celebrate the good old days and chart a better course towards the future of the school. Speaking at the occasion, president of the college’s alumni association, Olufemi O. Martins, described merging technical institutions, polytechnics and colleges of education under the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) as misdirected. Martins said failure to understand the real goal of the Nigerian policy on education has led to the altering of the NBTE curriculum. “There is a big difference between these institutions but we have failed to realise that students in colleges of technology are trained to re-engineer the society and this is an area we need to look into. During my time, we never fought for the BSC/HND dichotomy but the moment we began to realise the disparity, we have continued to agitate that technological education be recognised. The keynote address was delivered by Chief Executive Officer, Slot Systems Limited, Nnamdi Ezeigbo. The entrepreneur cum author, who graduated with the 1992/1993 class, gave an inspiring and informative lecture on how to start and grow a business in a challenging environment like Nigeria. He disclosed that knowledge, partnership, integrity and competitive strategy are key elements to succeeding in business.
