Benue state chapter of the Association of Nigerian Authors ANA has called on people of the state to patronise the state library. Chairman of the Association, Dr. Charles Iornumbe made the call recently when he led other executive members on a familiarisation visit to the state library Board headquarters in Makurdi. He said though the state library was in a deplorable condition, it has facilities such as operational computers for electronic library and books among others that could be useful to students and researchers at all levels of education. Dr. Iornumbe expressed the readiness of ANA Benue to establish its presence at the state library like other chapters were doing elsewhere in the country in the area of book exhibition, promotion and reading, saying the chapter has received with joy, moves the state government was already making to rehabilitate the library. The ANA Benue chairman who said the Association was in touch with the commissioner for information, culture and Tourism, Mrs. Ngunan Addingi for her ministryâ€™s approval to establish its presence at the library, expressed happiness with the warm reception accorded the literary body so far. He said if sustained, the proposed collaboration between ANA Benue and the state ministry of information for the promotion of reading culture would be enhanced for the growth of literary creativity and the entire education sub sector. Earlier, the Director, Benue state Library Board, Mrs. Theresa Zamber had expressed the readiness of the state Library Board to partner the state chapter of the Association of Nigerian Authors to promote books. Mrs. Zamber particularly urged ANA Benue members to help the Board to sensitise the Benue populace on the need to patronise the state library, saying the state government was aware of the deplorable condition of the facility and was working towards overhauling it for optimal use.
