The Nigeria Automobile Technicians Association (NATA), Lagos State Chapter has appealed to the Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu not to convert the approved Ojota mechanic village to refuse dump site. The Chairman Ojota Branch of the association Mr. Prosper Ampeh on Wednesday said it had come to their notice that the management of Olusosun refuse dump site wanted to extend their operations to the mechanic village. According to him, the association had been informed to vacate about four hectares of its site used as Ojota mechanics village for the purpose of extending the Olusosun refuse dump site. “We are begging the state governor, at the same time sending Save Our Soul message to him to consider the over 4,000 artisans working at the village presently. “There are over 4,000 different artisans working in the mechanic village excluding Industrial Training (IT) students from various tertiary institutions coming for their practicals, the state government should consider us we appeal,” he said. Rasak Ayoola, the Former Chairman of the association also begged the state government not to throw the huge number of artisans at the mechanic village into the labour market. According to him, many artisans will definitely become jobless if their workshops were taken away from them. He said families and dependants of the artisans would also suffer as a result of the development. “This is a mechanic village which had existed since 1982, approved by the state government; we are paying our dues accordingly to both local and state governments. Shina Oyekunle, also former association chairman, decried the level of environmental and water pollutions the refuse had caused to the various communities in the area.
