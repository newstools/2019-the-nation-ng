Nigeria defender William Troost-Ekong made key impacts to help Udinese end a five-game winless run as they beat Cagliari 2-1 on Saturday, Italy Serie A game. Troost-Ekong and Cote d ‘Ivoire Seko Fofana delivered impressive performances as Udinese secured a victory after a five-game winless run, including last weekend’s defeat to Juventus. The African stars were at their best to ensure Luca Gotti’s men ended their miserable run of results at Dacia Arena. Troost-Ekong, who made his 15th league appearance in the encounter, had a 73% successful pass rate. Fofana, meanwhile, was afforded his eighth start of the season and set up Rodrigo De Paul for the opening goal of the match in the 39th minute. The visitors levelled through Joao Pedro before the 24-year-old Ivorian international scored the match-winner with five minutes left to play.
