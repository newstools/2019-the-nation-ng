A mentally-deranged man, whose age was put at 32, has been reportedly beheaded and his limbs and manhood removed by unknown persons in Ugwuawarawa, Nsukka, Enugu State. The Nation gathered that residents on Tuesday discovered the mutilated body of the victim near Alor Uno-Enugu Ezike-Onuiyi Haven junction. It was learnt that the residents had noticed machete cuts on the deceased three days earlier, before his remains were discovered, an indication that his assailants had attempted to kill and decapitate him. The remains were abandoned near a drainage on the roadside before the T-junction. Eyewitnesses said that the deceased was always seen at the area either scavenging for food or begging for alms, adding that he managed to survive last weekâ€™s attack and was still nursing the injuries he sustained due to the deep cuts on his left arm before he was beheaded. Police sources, who confirmed the incident, said that the old injury was so deep that he always supported the affected arm with his right hand while searching for food. Police spokesman Ebere Amaraizu could not be reached for comments, as he was said to be outside the country attending a security conference. Owners of shops and other business outfits near the scene of the incident did not open yesterday, apparently to avoid being harassed by security agents. It was confirmed that detectives from the Nsukka Police Division had evacuated the body from the scene.
