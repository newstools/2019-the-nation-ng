NIGERIA, under Coach Gernot Rohr, boast of the finest attacking options on the continent at the moment, according to Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze. The Super Eagles are currently ranked 31st in the world and third in Africa behind Senegal and Tunisia with Algeria, who defeated Nigeria at the semi-finals of the 2019 AFCON a further spot behind in fourth. Despite Liverpool’s Sadio Mane spearheading the Teranga Lions’ attack and Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez being the most celebrated of the Desert Warriors forwards, Samuel Chukwueze is convinced that Africa’s finest attack is Nigeria’s. Victor Osimhen, Samuel Kalu, Moses Simon, Samuel Chukwueze and Alex Iwobi are presently Gernot Rohr’s most preferred options for his four forward positions with all five players young, fast and starring for respectable sides in Europe. Not forgetting captain Ahmed Musa whose return from an injury setback offers the Super Eagles an experienced performer upfront. The combination of all these factors, Chukwueze believes, should drive real fear into other African teams who face Nigeria any time soon. “The future is very bright (for the Super Eagles attack) and I am happy to play alongside them,” Chukwueze told Sports Vanguard as monitored by Soccernet.ng about playing together with Osimhen, Kalu, and Moses. “Not only for the national team, when you go to their clubs you see that they are also doing very well.”
