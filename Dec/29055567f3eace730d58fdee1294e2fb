Anthony Joshua has offered to be Tyson Fury’s sparring partner if it helps his fellow Brit beat Deontay Wilder. Joshua has been left frustrated in his attempts to lure WBC heavyweight champion Wilder into the ring as he bids to unify the division. Joshua, who now holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO belts following his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr last weekend, feels he has a better chance of landing a blockbuster unification showdown with Fury than with Wilder. Fury faces a re-match with the American on February 22, having drawn their first encounter, and Joshua told Sky Sports News: “I think honestly he might beat Wilder next time. “I think Fury would fight me quicker than Wilder would, so, if that’s the case, I want him to win. Imagine that fight on British soil. “If Tyson needs me, I’ll go out and spar with him to get him ready for Wilder.” Nevertheless Joshua, 30, remains desperate for a mega-fight with Wilder which would see both men attempt to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis. “It still puzzles me as to why it’s so difficult to pin this man down,” Joshua added. “This is the man I need to pin down to get the last ring and conquer this division. “When he’s ready, as I am, I would love to be here talking about Deontay Wilder and the keys to victory. “It’s not about me, it’s about the sport and the legacy. If he wants to create his legacy and he wants to be a future hall of famer, he needs to come and see us.
