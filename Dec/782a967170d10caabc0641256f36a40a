 THE Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the Federal University of Technology (FUT), Minna, the Niger State capital, yesterday organised a peaceful rally against the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) enrolment. It warned the IPPIS officials not to enrol its members into the Federal Government payroll system. The rally, which included the universityâ€™s ASUU Chairman Dr. Mohammed Attaihiru Ndanisa, and some other members, was peaceful. The union members walked round the school, singing solidarity songs and condemning the new payroll system. The members later went to the Senate boardroom, where the enrolment was taking place, to meet the IPPIS officials. They met some non-academic workers conducting the enrolment and confirmed that none of their members was present. Addressing the IPPIS officials, Ndanisa advised them against registering any ASUU member, saying there would be consequences if they did. The union leader said ASUU was against the IPPIS enrolment, adding that the union would not take it likely with any member who flouted its order. He told non-academic workers that ASUU had no problem with them enrolling into the system. The union leader urged the IPPIS officials to continue with the enrolment.
