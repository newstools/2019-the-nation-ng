An Igbosere Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos has fixed January 11 for the trial of two workers of Union Bank, PLC, Lagos, Vivian Okoro, 36, and Femi Omomeji, 36, accused of assaulting and inflicting injuries on a Nollywood actress, Chioma Toplis. The defendants were arraigned before Magistrate A. M. Davies in February on a two-count charge bordering on assault occasioning bodily harm. They pleaded not guilty. Their trial was delayed following the absence of the complainant, who travelled to London to treat herself from the injuries she sustained from the assault. At the resumed proceedings on Monday, police prosecutor Reuben Solomon told the court that the complainant had arrived from her 10 months medical trip to a London hospital and that she was ready for the trial. Okoro, who had relocated, was living in the same building with the complainant at the time of the incident at 11, Abagbon Close, Victoria Island, Lagos, while Omomeji, the head of graphics at the Union Bank headquarters, Lagos resides at Church Street, Ipaja, Lagos. Solomon had informed the court that the defendants, who claimed to be lovers, committed the offence at 11, Abagbon Close, off Olorogun Agbaje Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. Solomon told the court that the complainant reported that she was at home on the fateful day watching TV when electricity supply to her apartment suddenly went off. He said when she came out from her apartment to check what had happened to her light, she met the defendants by her meter removing the switch. Solomon said when the complainant challenged the defendants why they removed her meter switch, they beat her up and dragged her on the ground. Consequently, she sustained multiple fractures on her left leg and injuries all over her body.
