The Coker-Aguda Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos State on Monday demolished shanties along the canal. The demolition was carried out by the officials of the Environmental department. The council Chairman, Mrs. Omobolanle Akinyemi-Obe, Area ‘C’ Commander Fatai Tijani and divisional police officers of some police stations in the area supervised the demolition. Mrs. Akinyemi-Obe said the shanties were the places the hoodlums used as their hideouts. She said after terrorising residents on the streets, the hoodlums returned to the hideouts to share their loot. “The hoodlums commit a lot of atrocities around this canal. We have heard about rape cases, molestation of residents at night and robberies. The shanties were built without the knowledge of the council and it was unfortunate that the residents refused to report them to the appropriate quarters. We can’t allow some group of unruly boys to threaten the peace of the communities,” she said. On the appeal by the Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo), to lift the suspension on the activities of the NURTW and the Road Transport Employee Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in the LCDA, Mrs. Akinyemi-Obe said the union leaders were yet to meet the conditions giving to them by the council. She said once the conditions are met, the suspension will be lifted. Part of the conditions, she said, was for the union leaders to disassociate themselves from the hoodlums.
