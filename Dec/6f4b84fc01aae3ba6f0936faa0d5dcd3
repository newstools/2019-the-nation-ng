Our Reporter  Despite the threat of a court injunction to stop his December 26 show, Kizz Daniel is set to perform. On Tuesday, Kizz even announced via Instagram that Davido will be performing at the concert slated to hold at the Eko Convention Centre, Lagos. He wrote: “ONE TICKET” Straight to #kizzdaniellive #nbsconcert as OBO @davidoofficial TAKES THE WHEEL __ 2 DAYs 2 GO.” About 10 days ago, estranged record label of Kizz Daniel, G-Worldwide Entertainment (GWW), said it would frustrate Kizz Daniel’s concert. According to their lawyer, Olisa Agbakoba (SAN), GWW is unhappy that Kizz Daniel has run away. The record label slammed N500m as damages. Agbakoba also said they were going to file a case to stop Kizz Daniel’s show, ‘Kizz Daniel Live In Concert’, scheduled for Boxing Day at the Eko Hotel Convention Centre, Lagos. “We’re going to apply for an injunction to stop the show because he is tied to us. And the matter is in court and the court has to decide.”  Days later, Kizz Daniel’s lawyers, L and A Legal Consultants, stated that the show will go ahead as planned and that there is no court order restraining Kizz Daniel from performing. One of the team, Oluwaseye Lawal, said: “Many people believe that only the label can end such agreements which is not true. It depends on the specific terms of the contract. We would like to state though that Kizz did not breach his contract, he terminated it formally after issuing a notice of termination as required by the contract. We want to state that there is no court order anywhere in the world preventing Kizz Daniel from performing his craft. We call on all his fans to come out and enjoy good music.”
