Indigenes of Ojo and entire Awori communities in the Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos State have been advised to remain united for the growth and development of the entire Awori land. The Permanent Secretary, Office of the Head of Service, Lagos State, Mr Ajibade Olusegun, gave this advice in a lecture titled ‘Who Will Sing the Redemption Song” delivered at the Exemplary Leadership Award ceremony organised by the Ojo Progressive Alliance for the immediate past Managing Director, Lekki Concession Company Limited ( LCC), Mr Mubashiru Hassan, held at the Ojo Local Government Multipurpose Hall, Lagos. Olusegun, who attributed the slow pace of socio-economic and political development of the people of Awori land in the state to lack of unity, said: “Except the Awori brace themselves for the socio-economic and political challenges facing them and speak with one voice, they would continue to lag behind in the scheme of things in the state’. He noted that the “Exemplary Leadership Award “ bestowed on Hassan by the Ojo Progressive Alliance was appropriate and timely to recognize his commitment and contributions to the socio-economic and political development of the entire Awori land in the state. He said: “Hassan is a worthy ambassador of Awori land whose contributions to the development of the Awori race in Lagos State cannot be rivalled. His contributions in the areas of education, economy and politics in Lagos State and Nigeria are worthy of being recognized and celebrated in the state.” He enjoined the people of Awori land, especially the youths, to emulate the sterling qualities of the award recipient. In his response after the award, Hassan said he was moved by the numerous good will messages by the eminent personalities on the occasion. He said the award was a challenge to brace himself to do more for the people of Awori land.
