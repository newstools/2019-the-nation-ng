  The newly elected president of the Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), Sonny Echono, has pledged to improve the lots of his members. Speaking in Lagos recently, Echono also urged the member of the association to look out for the well-being of each other so as to be able to advance a common interest with the intent of improving the services they render to their clients. He urged that there was a need to make themselves’ relevant to the society by forging partnerships with various bodies so that the society will be a better place for both them and people around them. He said: “We need to promote the quality of services that we render to our clients. That is one of the worrying areas where clients have expressed dissatisfaction or excuse that they give for not patronizing local architects. When we are talking about the cost benefits analysis, we want the client to see why it is wise not to be penny wise and pound-foolish. At the long run, the architect also delivers value. We pray that Lagos chapter will continue to show the way and raise the bar.” According to him, the NIA inaugurated a new national executive with a pledge to address issues of environmental development in the society and achieving 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in the country. Speaking during the inauguration, Echono assured the council of commitment in ensuring that the Annual General Meeting & Conference become a reference for Targeted knowledge acquisition and Professional exchanges.
