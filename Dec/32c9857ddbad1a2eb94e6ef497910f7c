 AIR Peace crew members have been hailed for thwarting efforts by two women to traffic a three-month-old boy from Lagos to Banjul, The Gambia. They were honoured by Crime Reporters Association of Nigeria (CRAN) at its 27th annual lecture and awards. CRAN President Sunday Odita, said: “We are elated as reporters to observe in the course of our duties that some people are doing things worthy of writing home about. When we noted that an Air Peace Crew demonstrated commendable professionalism and humanness by frustrating the attempt by two women to traffic a three-month old baby-boy on a Lagos-Banjul flight on June 4, 2018, we penned it down as something worthy of reward. He praised his members “for unanimously voting to bestow the Most Security Conscious Crew Award on Air Peace Crew, when it was tabled before the house for voting.” This he added, shows that the honour is well deserved and well thought out. Calling on people from all walks of life to emulate the uprightness demonstrated by the Air Peace Crew, he encouraged the winners to “be proud of the award because it is coming unsolicited from the conscience of the society.” Air Peace Corporate Communications Executive, Stanley Olisa noted that the airline trains its cabin crew to be security conscious. “It has proved worthwhile as the airline had in recent times prevented three acts of child trafficking. Our flight attendants are always security conscious and we will continue to partner with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, (NAPTIPS) to report any suspected act of child trafficking”, Olisa noted.
