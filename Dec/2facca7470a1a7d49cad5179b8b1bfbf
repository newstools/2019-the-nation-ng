THERE is an air of invincibility about Liverpool this season, as they continue to chase their first league title in 30 years. Saturday’s victory at the Vitality was so routine – though the early loss of Ake to injury weakened an already struggling Bournemouth back four. But the Reds played with a swagger and a dominance which would have surely pleased manager Jurgen Klopp greatly. They picked up their first clean sheet in 13 games and found new Premier League goal scorers in Oxlade-Chamberlain and Keita – the 15th and 16th players to score in the competition for Liverpool this season. Going into the match, Klopp said “being top at Christmas is not important”, but with a crucial Champions League game against Red Bull Salzburg coming up on Tuesday, the fact Liverpool have such a commanding lead over their domestic rivals at this stage means he has been able to rotate players to keep them fresh. Sadio Mane, the orchestrator of Liverpool’s 5-2 Merseyside derby victory over Everton on Wednesday, was an unused substitute alongside centre-forward Divock Origi, while 18-year-old Curtis Jones came on for his Premier League debut. All in all, it was a successful afternoon for Liverpool, who just keep getting the job done.
