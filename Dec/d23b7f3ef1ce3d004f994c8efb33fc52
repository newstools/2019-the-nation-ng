By Osagie Otabor, Bénin One of the conveners of the Edo Peoples Movement(EPM), Mr. Henry Idahagbon, has declared the movement no longer exist having achieved its purposes. Idahagbon was replying to comments by Governor Godwin Obaseki that those in EPM members are not members of the All Progressives Congress(APC) and are frustrating his plans for Edo people. He said Obaseki’s cluelessness made him not to know that the EPM was dissolved and buried on November 13, 2019. Idahagbon stated that EPM members were not arsonists that set markets on fire. The former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General said Obaseki lacked ideas on how to manage governance and political party. His words, “That statement from a clueless Governor is sad. If he needs idea on how to run government, he should come to us. To prevent fire in market places, he should buy fire trucks and resuscitate the moribund ones. “Each market should have a fire truck and an industrial borehole. He collects N500m monthly as security votes. He can buy many fire trucks from that money instead of going to Indonesia to sign worthless MOU. “How can we go and put fire in the market when our mothers are selling there?” On comments that Oshiomhole has lost support of the people, Idahagbon asked Obaseki to wait for the elections.
