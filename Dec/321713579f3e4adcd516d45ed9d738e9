An N-POWER beneficiary, Orioye Gbayisemore, is now set to organise a summit for petty fishermen in the riverine areas of Ondo state. According to him, the summit is geared at teaching the fishermen on how to use modern technology in their trade and also improve the business. Gbayisemore is a graduate of Physics Education from Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo State. He said the maiden summit billed to hold on December 11 at Ugbonla Community in Ilaje local government area of the state, will parade professionals that will equip the artisanal fishermen with best practices in the industry. It will be chaired by the state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. “The Ilaje fishermen summit is an idea born out of the desire of giving a face lift to the fishing business, which is the main occupation of the Ilaje’s across the globe,” he said. “Over the years, there has been little or no government support to them, as they do to farmers. This summit is an avenue for government to know that the 60% fish and crayfish are produced by the artisanal fishermen and as such, the need to jointly promote them is important. “This is my little way of contributing positively to the lives of the local fishermen. This will be a platform to train and retrain the fishermen on the need to embrace modern fishing techniques and to enhance their skills. The program will be done yearly.”
