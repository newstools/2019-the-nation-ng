By Olaitan Ganiu TO continuously engage citizens, the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency (LSACA) has sensitised the deaf and blind communities on basic facts on HIV/AIDS. The training, which held at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) complex, where over 250 visually-impaired were gathered, enlightened participants on various sexually-transmitted infections as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, universal safety precautions, referrals and linkages. LSACA Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Monsurat Adeleke said it was vital to sensitise the deaf and blind communities in the state. She also hinted that the training was part of the mandate of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure awareness of HIV/AIDS reached all residents of the state. “We are passing this prevention messages to this ‘special people’ so that they too can help disseminate to other people in their respective region because we want everyone in the state to be enlightened and aware of HIV/AIDS, especially how it can be transmitted, intervention and prevention.  “The deaf and the blind people have unprotected sex with one another. The hearing community takes advantage of the poverty in the country and among the deaf women and girls to lure them into having unprotected sex with them, which further exposes them to the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV and AIDs.” One of the beneficiaries, Adeleye Kayode Afolabi, commended the state government for the training, saying it has widened his knowledge on sexually-transmitted infections.
