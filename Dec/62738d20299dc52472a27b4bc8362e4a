An Ojo Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos on Monday has remanded a suspected traffic offender Bernard Ogechi in prison for allegedly hitting and crushing the leg of a Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Marshal with his vehicle. The incident occurred on November 30, when the FRSC Marshal was controlling traffic at Abule Osun axis of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. Magistrate AA Adesanya after listening to the two parties and watching the video evidence provided by FRSC, awarded N350, 000 against Ogechi with two sureties. One of the sureties, Adesanya said, must be a blood relation and the other a clergy or traditional ruler. He is also to show evidence of three-year tax payment. However, the defendant was unable to meet his bail condition and was subsequently remanded in the Medium Security Correctional Centre, Kirikiri, Apapa. The case was then adjourned till February 11. FRSC Lagos Sector Commander Hyginus Omeje advised motorists to desist from assaulting traffic officials. Anyone who is caught in such an act, Omeje said, will face the full wrath of the law. He also stressed the need to always obey traffic rules and regulations during the festive period and beyond.
