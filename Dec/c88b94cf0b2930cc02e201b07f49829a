The police have waded into the case of the federal agencyâ€™s head whose son was caught in Dubai, United Arab Emirates driving a Lamborghini and with $5 million cash. Already, the Finance Director of the organisation has been summoned by the police. The Managing Director is also fighting back, querying and suspending people in the Accounts and Audit Departments of the agency, which is very vital to the economic revolution programme of President Muhammadu Buhari. The bank, a very prominent bank, allegedly used to launder money to different parts of the world, is also being investigated. It is a messy affair in the agency.
