The abducted wife of a traditional ruler in Ondo state, Oba Rufus Akinrimade, the Orunja of Odigbo has regained her freedom. The kidnappers also freed two of their children (daughters) and the driver who were abducted last weekend along Owo-Oba-Ikare Akoko road. Oba Akinrinmade confirmed the development at his Odigbo Palace that the victims had been reunited with their families. The kidnappers had contacted the monarch to demand a ransom of N100 but it was later reduced to N60m. It was not certain at press time if any ransom was paid before they were released. The monarchâ€™s wife was heading to Akoko from Odigbo to visit another child who is an undergraduate at Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko (AAUA) when the gunmen seize them.
