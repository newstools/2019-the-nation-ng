The Chairman Imo Sports Commission, Fan Ndubuoke has revealed that hosting the 2022 National Sports Festival (NSF) will enable the state upgrade the existing sports facilities and create new sports centres across the state. Ndubuoke while making this disclosure said the bid for the hosting of the festival is at the finishing stage which will be submitted to the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development for consideration. He added that the Governor of the  state Emeka Ihedioha want to make Imo State the home of sports in the eastern region where all facilities needed to host any sporting events  in future would be made available. The former national SWAN President assured that if given the hosting right, the state would adopt the COJA 2003 All Africa Games model where the state will spend less in staging the festival. “Well you can see that the government of the state is interested in sports development which is one of the key areas in rebuilding the state. Creating Sports Commission means that the governor is serious about sports development and hosting the festival will enable him put in place sporting facilities in different local government areas and communities. It will also help in checkmating youth restiveness. “Hosting the festival will also increase and create more business activities during the games.  If given the nod, we want to host the best game in the history of the festival,” said Ndubuoke.
