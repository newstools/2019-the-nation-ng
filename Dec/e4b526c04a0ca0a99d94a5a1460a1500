LAGOS State Government last night explained what informed new closing and resumption dates for schools in the Centre of Excellence. It said the new dates only affect public primary schools. In a statement, Information and Strategy Commissioner for Gbenga Omotoso said the new dates would not affect closing and resumption dates for private schools and government public secondary schools. The change in date, according to the statement, was made to allow government implement an extensive retraining of teachers and prepare them for the new term in 2020. It reads: “Please note that the curriculum of Lagos State private and public schools is not affected in anyway by these changes and Lagos state will continue to implement her existing curriculum across the state.” It urged members of the public to disregard any misleading information contrary to the official statement. The Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has promised to invest heavily in capacity training for the public servants especially teachers in order to make them realise its vision for a technological driven education system.
