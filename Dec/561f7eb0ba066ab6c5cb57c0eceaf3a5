It was a black Boxing Day in Ogbomoso area of Oyo state as hundreds of sympathisers wailed over death of five persons involved in a ghastly motor accident that occurred along Ilorin – Ogbomoso road. Several other people were said to have sustained varying degrees of injuries  in the  auto crash involving two vehicles . The injured, it was gathered, had been evacuated to nearby medical facilities in Ogbomoso by men of the Federal Road Safety Commission ( FRSC) and police men . Other spirited sympathisers were also seen involved in the rescue mission at the scene of the accident. It was learnt that  the crash was  as a result of dangerous overtaking by  a driver of one of the ill-fated Ilorin- bound vehicles . An eyewitness, Mr Ade Akanmu, said four people died on the spot while the last person died before getting to the hospital. Akanmu said: “It was a gory sight. Two vehicles were involved,  one is a Mitsubishi Lancer marked OYO GBY 322AA with another car with registration number OYO RUW 135 XA. “The accident, which occurred at Ladokun in Surulere North LCDA area of Oyo State, happened when an Ilorin-bound passenger vehicle collided with another vehicle on the opposite side of the road. “In all, five people – three men and two women -died on the spot. Several others suffered varying degrees of injuries. “We rescued the victims by cutting parts of the vehicles with an axe.” One of the passengers who lost their lives in the accident was identified as Chief Alaaga by some sympathisers at the scene. It was gathered that the late Alaaga was coming from a meeting when he met his death. When contacted on the telephone, the state Commander, Federal Road Safety Corp, Mrs Uche Chukura, said she had yet to receive any signal on the accident. However,  an FRSC official in Ogbomoso Zone, who confirmed the incident, said some men had been dispatched to the scene of the crash.
