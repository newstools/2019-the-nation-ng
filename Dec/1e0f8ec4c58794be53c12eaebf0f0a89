 The Lagos State Council for Arts and Culture has awarded certificates to 34 beneficiaries of its five-day 2019 Creative Industries Skill Acquisition Workshop. Participants learnt diverse creative skills ranging from plastic craft, paper craft, and tie and dye to soft cushion, card craft among others to ignite the entrepreneurship spirit. Speaking at the closing of the training held at the Council’s premises in Alausa, Ikeja last Friday, the Director of Arts and culture, Mrs. Sadiat Olaitan, disclosed that the programme was the third in the series targeted at unemployed graduates, widows and secondary school leavers. In her words: “I am very convinced that this workshop has been able to achieve the objective for which it was organised through monitoring, observation and I can testify that the facilitators have done well; and the participants have gained tremendously from the workshop,” She said. She urged the beneficiaries to use their skills to become self-employed while thanking Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his commitment to tackling poverty through employment generation and wealth creation through the creative sector.
