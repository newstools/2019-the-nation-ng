Taofeek Babalola  Former Nigeria Professional Football League champions Plateau United will try to maintain its unbeaten run in the 2019/20 season when they clash with Heartland FC in one of the Matchday 7 fixtures at Okigwe Township Stadium tomorrow. The Coach Abdu Maikaba tutored side has remained on the summit with 14 points since Matchday 1 and has amassed an incredible seven points from a possible nine in their three away matches so far. Wikki Tourists, which is enjoying a fine run in the ongoing season, will also be on the road to face FC Ifeanyiubah in Nnewi, a team they have only lost to once in their last five league meetings. The Big Elephants are just one point off the top of the table with 13 points from six matches. Kano Pillars will hope to continue their resurgence when the team’s captain Rabiu Ali leads them out at the Sani Abacha Stadium when they host Delta Force. Pillars backed to winning ways after their worst league start in years with a 2-1 win over Akwa starlets in Uyo on Wednesday in which Ali provided the assists for both goals scored by Nyima Nwagua. There is not much time for the NPFL debutants Akwa Starlets to grieve their home loss to Pillars as they make a short trip to Abia Warriors tomorrow. Both sides have lost just once in the league this term. Akwa United will hope to record its first win this season when they host Adamawa United at the Nest of Champions in Uyo. At the Ondo State Sports Complex in Akure, Sunshine Stars will confront Nasarawa United who are yet to win a game this season while Lagos-based side MFM FC will make a trip to Katsina United for tomorrow’s game at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium, a venue where they got a point last season. Two games have been postponed due to continental engagements involving league champions Enyimba and Rangers. Enyimba’s home tie against Rivers United is off, so also Rangers’ fixture against Jigawa Golden Stars in Enugu.
