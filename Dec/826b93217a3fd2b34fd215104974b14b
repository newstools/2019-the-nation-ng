The Osun State government has warned contractor engaged for Oba Adesoji Aderemi East Bye Pass Road against unnecessary delay in the handling of the project. Commissioner for Works and Transport, Oluremi Omowaiye, gave the warning in Osogbo, Osun State capital, during an unscheduled visit to the ongoing road project. Omowaiye expressed concern at the slow pace of work on the roads under construction in Osogbo and some other towns in the state. The commissioner urged the contractors to hasten work on the projects, saying they must be completed not later than March next year. Omowaiye, who said he spoke with Governor Gboyega Oyetola on phone, said he (Oyetola) expressed his dissatisfaction and concern over the slow pace of the work and warned that any contractor who fails to meet up with time and work without specification will be sanctioned. He, however, warned the contractors on the need to ensure they wet the roads under construction thrice in a day because of the hazards the dust could cause to the residents around the area. Omowaiye said: “I am using this medium to sound a note of warning to all contractors handling our projects; we will not hesitate to sanction them because our electorate’s expectations are very high. For one reason or the other, the contractors are not working the way they are supposed to work. Director of Highways, Ministry of Works and Transport, Bashiru Akande, also expressed displeasure at the slow pace of work and urged the contractor to brace up.
