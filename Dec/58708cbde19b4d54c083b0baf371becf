Those romantic stories we read in books are not totally fiction pieces. At times, these things happen in reality. Or how else can we explain the love story of Tope Akeju and Becky Effor? Tope, who is the former bursar of Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Joseph Akeju’s second son, on November 16, tied the knot with his girlfriend of 16 years. Ever since they met in 2003, they became attached to each other. After the church wedding at St. Stephen Catholic Church, Iwaya, Lagos, a colourful reception was held at Triple C Event Centre, Yaba, Lagos. The couple couldn’t hold back their excitement, giving guests a show on the dance floor. It was learnt that the union was threatened by their background differences. Tope is a Yoruba man from Ekiti, while Becky is from Cross Rivers. Yet, they didn’t let each other when things were uncertain. The groom’s father, popularly known as JB, invited all his friends from different parts of the country to witness the November celebration. He has previously given two daughters’ hands in marriage but Tope is his first son taking a wife. That gave him a priceless feeling.
