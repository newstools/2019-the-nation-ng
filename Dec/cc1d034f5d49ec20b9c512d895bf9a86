CHINA has suspended visits by United States (U.S.) Navy ships and aircraft to Hong Kong after Washington passed legislation last week backing pro-democracy protesters. Beijing also unveiled sanctions against a number of U.S. human rights groups. It comes after President Donald Trump signed the Human Rights and Democracy Act into law. The act orders an annual review to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify special trading status with the U.S. President Trump is currently seeking a deal with China to end a trade war. The foreign ministry said it would suspend the reviewing of applications to visit Hong Kong by U.S. military ships and aircraft from yesterday – and warned that further action could come. “We urge the U.S. to correct the mistakes and stop interfering in our internal affairs,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing. “China will take further steps if necessary to uphold Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity and China’s sovereignty.” Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) targetted by sanctions include Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the International Republican Institute.
