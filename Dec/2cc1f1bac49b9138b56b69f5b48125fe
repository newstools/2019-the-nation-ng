Osagie Otabor, Benin Youths and elders of Ujiogba community in Esan West local government on Friday protested the killing of one of their sons, Maxwell Okpoma, by officials of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). The villagers took the corpse of the deceased to the office of the NDLEA but were chased away by sporadic gunshots by officials of the NDLEA. Speaking to newsmen, brother to the deceased, Monday Okpoma, said the NDLEA officials were in the community to arrest some suspected drug dealers when they shot his younger brother. Monday said the NDLEA officials ran away by shooting into the air after killing his brother. He stated that the NDLEA were to arrest drug dealers and not kill them. Traditional ruler of the community, HRH Solomon Izuware, said it was a slap on him for people to petition the NDLEA that youths in the community were drug dealers. He said youths in the community were law abiding citizens doing responsible jobs. Parents of the deceased, Pa and Mrs Okpoma, described late Maxwell as a humble and hardworking man. But spokesman for the NDLEA, Edo State Command, Mitchell Ofojeyu, said the late Maxwell has been on the wanted list of the command. Mitchell said Maxwell was hit by stray bullet by his men who were trying to escape mob attack. He said the vehicle used by the officials was destroyed before the shooting began.
