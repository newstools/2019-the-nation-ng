The younger ones are now giving the elderly a run for their money. At 17, Timilehin Agoro has justified the expression that age is just a number.  Through her Tangerine Lagos initiative, Agoro has recently unveiled ‘Based On True Events Collection,’ which focuses mainly on tee-shirts with messages that speak against rape, anger, pains and other social vices. Agoro believes in using positive words to send important messages that will help people to heal from pains or trauma, empower and help them to make a change for the better. She said: “This collection is vital and very special to me because it allows me to turn my pain into gain and helped in my healing. I believe this can help people to keep pushing. “I will like to show a huge appreciation to everyone who worked tirelessly on this project. I thank my graphic designers, printers, models, my mother and friends. They were there for me all through this journey and helped in the creation of these pieces.”
