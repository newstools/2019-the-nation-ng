In his response, the former governor thanked the former lawmakers for the visit and described them as partners in progress. “I am happy to receive my colleagues, the former lawmakers, l thanked you for recognising our efforts while in power,” he said.

He appealed to the party supporters in the state to ensure peace, unity and be law abiding. APC chairman in Zamfara, Alhaji Lawal Liman, thanked the forum and described the visit as a timely and a welcome development.
