 OVER 200 widows and orphans last week, received succour from the Naval Officers’ Wives Association (NOWA). The beneficiaries, who were largely immediate family members of slain military personnel, had a day of respite, love and care at the Navy Town in Ojo, Lagos. Tagged “a day with widows and orphans,” the beneficiaries were enrolled in various skills at the NOWA Skills Centre, while those previously trained in the bi-annual outing, received starter packs to commence their trade and fend for their families. Speaking at the event, NOWA’s President Mrs. Theresa Ibas said the event was a tradition she inherited from her predecessor Mrs. Vivian Ezeoba. Noting that times were hard for widows and orphans, Mrs Ibas said the association had fashioned ways to ensure the beneficiaries not only stand on their footing but are able to assist others in the nearest future. “This empowerment is in continuation of what NOWA had been doing in the past and it gives me great pleasure to add that our Skills Acquisition.”
