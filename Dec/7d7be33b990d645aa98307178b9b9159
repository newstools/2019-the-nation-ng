 Lagos House of Assembly ad-hoc committee on screening, on Friday, screened three commissioner-nominees from Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and eight others for the House of Assembly Service Commission and Lagos State Civil Service Commission. The three cabinet nominees screened by the committee were Mr Ganiyu Ayuba, Mr Olugbenga Oyerinde and Bamigbose Martins. The commissioner-nominees are to replace the three rejected by the assembly during the screening of commissioner-designates in August. Those rejected by the house then were Mr Ajayi Bembe, Mr George Obafemi and Prince Olanrewaju Sanusi. The committee’s chairman, Mr Rotimi Abiru (Somolu II), said a total of 11 nominees were submitted by the governor to the assembly for screening and confirmation. He said the eight other nominees included three for the state house of assembly service commission while five nominees were for state civil service commission. The nominees for the assembly service commission were Mr Akeem Bello, former member of the 8th Assembly, Mr Kabiru Lawal,  a member from 2007 – 2011 and Mr Richard Osungboye. Abiru told newsmen at the end of the exercise that the committee would report to the house and confirmation or otherwise would be done during plenary session.
