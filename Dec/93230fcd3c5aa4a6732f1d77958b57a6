By Praise Olowe  President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a picture after House Democrats voted to impeach him, suggesting they are not out to get him. The picture shows a black-and-white photo of Trump seated in a chair and pointing directly into the camera. Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress by the House of Representatives making him the third president in US history to be impeached.  The House of Representatives voted almost entirely along party lines — 230-197-1 — to charge Trump with abuse of power, and it followed it up with a 229-198-1 vote to charge Trump with obstruction of Congress. pic.twitter.com/DutxclyZw9 — Donald J.
