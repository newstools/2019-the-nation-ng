The police in Lagos have arrested five persons, including a speech-impaired man, for alleged assault on a road user at Kosofe underbridge in Mile 12. The suspects were arrested around 4am on December 20 for allegedly attacking Mr. Emmanuel Awotayo. Police spokesman Bala Elkana said Morufu Adebusi, Masadu Shaibu, Alalehu Mohammed, Chuka Nwefor and Usman Aliyu were caught in possession of weapons, including cutlasses and knives. He said the police on the same day arrested a suspected traffic robber, Amodu Azeez, around 5:30am with a toy gun after dispossessing Arinze Madeben of his belongings. “The victim raised the alarm that the suspect and two others at large blocked him with a motorcycle, pointed a gun at him and robbed him of his android phone and a wallet containing N27,270. “The alarm attracted anti-robbery men on early morning patrol. The suspects were pursued and the ring leader, Azeez Amodu, was arrested. Others escaped. “The stolen items were recovered from the suspect. The motorcycle the suspects used for the robbery registered as JBD133VY was recovered. Police also recovered a toy gun used by the suspects for the robbery. Detectives are on the trail of the suspects at large,” Elkana said.
