Everton have officially sacked manager Marco Silva after Wednesday night’s humiliating defeat against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. Silva, who joined the club in May 2018, was on borrowed time after a run of form which has seen the Toffees win just once in their last six Premier League games. The loss on Wednesday saw Everton drop into the relegation zone and that was clearly the final straw for the board at Goodison Park who have decided to dispense of Silva’s services heading into the busy festive period. Everton have won just four of their 15 Premier League matches this season, losing nine, but the manner in which they were torn apart by their neighbours on Wednesday suggested Silva’s reign was beyond repair. Marcel Brands, the Director of Football, and Alexander Ryazantsev, the Chief Financial Officer, were angrily gesticulating in the Directors’ Box at Anfield while fans left early as they watched Everton fall to another defeat across Stanley Park. Silva has followed former Everton manager Ronald Koeman, who was sacked after a 5-2 defeat to Arsenal in October 2017, out the door after an embarrassing loss. Today’s decision by the club finally puts Silva out of his misery following weeks of intense speculation about his future.
