By Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has signed the 2020 Appropriation bill into law. He promised to deliver his electioneering promises with view to accelerating the standard of living of the people of the State. Fayemi, while signing the budget tagged ‘the budget of Deliverables’, described it as a plan focused on enhancing good
governance and implementing a speedy economic transformation of the State. He added that the budget signaled his administration’s focus on improving and “deepening the infrastructure stock required to attract investments to the State”. The governor stated that the signing of the appropriation bill into law has returned the State to its predictable January- December budget cycle while also switching from the old fashioned cash-based budgeting to International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS). He stated that his government was well positioned to implement the budget and continue the “journey of delivering our promises to the people”. Fayemi thanked the House of Assembly, the State Executive council members, the public service and Ekiti people for the collaborative efforts that have returned normalcy to the State
budgeting cycle. The governor said the Assembly has proven to be a worthy partner with
the executive by working “tirelessly to review the budget estimates and prepare a final budget”.
