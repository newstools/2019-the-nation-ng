 The Lagos State Government will only entertain applications for housing transactions that are accompanied with evidence of tax payments by applicants, the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Housing, Mr. Wasiu Akewusola, has said. He said no tax defaulter would have the opportunity to embark on housing transaction with the ministry and its agencies, except applications are backed with evidence of payment of personal income tax. Akewusola said: “The documents that would accompany all applications made to the ministry must include photocopy of Lagos State Revenue Receipt and bank deposit slip. “Others are assessment notice from the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), Electronic Tax Clearance (e-TCC) Card or three months salaries pay slips with corporate Identification Card of the employees.” He also said prospective applicants for either outright purchase or rent- to -own scheme are advised not to forward any application that does not include any of the aforementioned documents, as such requests will not be accepted. Akewusola further explained that housing construction and provision of infrastructure in the state are financed by tax payers’ money, and it is only right that beneficiaries of these projects must have contributed their own quota to the revenue of the state government. He, however, reiterated the commitment of the present administration to providing affordable and quality homes for the people, adding that the ultimate goal was to bring more Lagosians on the homeowners’ ladder. He enjoined residents of the state to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the state government in prioritising the completion of  all uncompleted housing projects in order to increase the stock of available homes in the state thereby reducing  the housing deficit. He also assured the general public that all applications completed with all required documents shall be promptly considered.
