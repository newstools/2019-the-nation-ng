Oluwamayomikun Orekoya A premier league giants Liverpool and Chelsea have joined Tottenham Hotspur in the race to sign Lille forward Victor Osimhen. The 20-year-old, who joined the Northern France club during the summer from Charleroi in Belgium, has enjoyed a fantastic start to life in France, scoring 12 goals and four assists in 23 appearances. Chelsea are looking to bring in some competition for Tammy Abraham while Liverpool are eager to add some more depth in attack, although the £7.25m arrival of RB Salzburg’s Takumi Minamino suggests they may have got the job done early. Tottenham’s Jose Mourinho is looking for new options in attack in a bid to keep Harry Kane, is the club’s only senior forward, fresh. Meanwhile, Osimhen has been declared fit and is expected to clash with international teammate Henry Onyekuru when Lille tackle on Monaco tomorrow. Osimhen was subbed off for Loic Remy in the 23rd minute of Lille’s 3-0 win over Monaco in the Coupe de la Ligue tie after complaining of dizziness and was rushed to the Princesse Grace de Monaco Hospital on Tuesday night. While Osimhem has set France on fire with his goals and all-round display, the same cannot be said of Onyekuru, who has struggled for game time since his arrival in the summer.
