Manchester United legend Eric Cantona has compared watching his former to club to seeing “an old man having sex”. The former forward spent five seasons at Old Trafford, scoring 82 goals. But Cantona is more well known to fans for his controversial behaviour, famously kung-fu kicking a supporter in 1995. And this has continued on his Instagram page, shocking fans with bizarre videos. The 53-year-old is also open in his assessment of the current United side. And his latest comments held nothing back on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side in a hilarious way. Speaking to OTRO, the Frenchman said: “Manchester United has a special place in my heart.  “But watching United play now is a bit like an old man who trying to make love. You are trying with all your might but at the end of the day, everyone’s a little disappointed.” But Cantona remains optimistic about his former side’s future. “When I say things about making love like an old man, sorry I am not talking about myself, it was only a metaphor,” he added. “They (United) will soon return because it is the biggest club in the world.” United currently sit eighth in the Premier League, 24 points off leaders Liverpool. And the Red Devils are 13 points away from a European spot.
