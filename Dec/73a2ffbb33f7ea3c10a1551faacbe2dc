 Nigeria’s teenage golf sensation, Georgia Oboh, is unruffled by the challenges of 2019 season as she bids for her maiden Ladies European Tour (LET) title in 2020. Oboh, who finished 34th at the Magical Kenya Ladies Open in Nairobi this month said she was hopeful of a better performance in LET title which is coming soon after her first year as a professional golfer.
“It has been a great year of new beginnings – my first year as a professional, my rookie season playing on the Ladies European Tour, Sunshine Ladies Tour, LET Access Series & ALPG,” she said. “I know that I am blessed to be able to play professional golf with the support of my family and well-wishers. I thank God for all my experiences this year and it will prepare me better for the years ahead.” Describing her performance in Kenya as the main highlight of 2019, Oboh added: “Finishing tied 34th in the inaugural Magical Kenya Ladies Open. It was an amazing week in Kenya for me. “I competed in the pro-am and then took part in the junior clinic along with my fellow Ladies European Tour (LET) pros. It was a wonderful experience as I was able to give something back to the local community in Vipingo, Kenya.” She however, target making it to Tokyo 2020 having featured at the Youth Olympic Games. “I’m currently ranked 1018 (as of Dec 9) which is outside the qualifying spots for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games but with some top finishes next year, I could qualify to compete at Tokyo 2020. It is a goal for me but I will need to put in a lot of hard work to achieve that especially with less than 7 months until the end of qualifying period.
For 2020, she had set a tall order for herself: “I want to win Ladies European Tour Qualifying School in January, win Sunshine Ladies Tour (South Africa) Order of Merit and win a Ladies European Tour event.”
