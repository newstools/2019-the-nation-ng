 Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas, has urged Nigerians to pray for military personnel engaged in various operations across the country. He also called for prayers for President Muhammadu Buhari and other Nigerian leaders for the grace to steer the country to the Promised Land. Ibas said Nigerians need to ask God to protect, guide and speedily grant troops victory in their various operations. The CNS prayed for the repose of the souls of fallen personnel. Ibas spoke at the weekend at 2019 Naval Officers’ Wives’ Association’s (NOWA’s) Christmas Carol Night at the Naval Dockyard Limited on Victoria Island, Lagos. He said: “As we prepare to enter the joyous season of Christmas, I urge us at this juncture to also spare a moment to pray for our colleagues and indeed all members of the nation’s Armed Forces who are currently deployed on national duty against acts of insurgency and criminality in the Northeast, Niger Delta and other theatres of conflict and insecurity across the country…”
