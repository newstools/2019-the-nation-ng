 Nigeria U23 striker Taiwo Awoniyi has been told to shun bad gangs and other social vices if he intends to have a lasting football career. Awoniyi, who currently plays for Bundesliga side FC Mainz, was advised by the Kwara state Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi when the Liverpool loanee paid a courtesy visit to the Deputy Governor’s office yesterday in Ilorin. “I want to advise you as a father not to drink, club, womanize and you must avoid joining bad gangs,” the Deputy Governor said. We are proud of you in Kwara and we will support you to make sure that your football career keeps shining.” Awoniyi, while presenting his club jersey to the Deputy Governor, thank him for his fatherly advice and promised he would abide by it. The deputy governor in his own part promised to visit Germany to watch one of the 22-year-old forward’s club games this season. Meanwhile, Awoniyi is not happy for his lack of game time in the German League with Mainz 05. Awoniyi has played only 149 minutes in six Bundesliga games and has failed to find the back of the net. “Every footballer wants to play and when you don’t get the game time you can’t be happy, ”Awoniyi reportedly said in an interview. “I don’t think I have completed 150 minutes yet, so there’s no way I am happy or satisfied. My injury also didn’t help the situation. “I have recovered fully and there are no more issues. However it was very difficult for me during that time and I am just glad to be back.”
