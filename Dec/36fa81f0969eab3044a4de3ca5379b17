 The National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Adams Oshiomhole, on Friday said that Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo was not ready for amicable resolution of the crisis rocking the party in the state. Oshiomhole made this known while briefing newsmen in Benin shortly after receiving Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu in his residence in Benin Oshiomhole said “the governor has been refusing and avoiding an all-inclusive meeting where all issues would have been tabled and resolved. “Four governors volunteered to attend the meeting but he has consistently refused to attend the meeting. “The only way to iron out issues is to sit down and listen to complaints. “He should not worry about the ticket but how to win the heart of Edo people. “The name of the game is persuation not violence. “The men whose cars were burnt yesterday will never vote for them again. It is unheard of to refuse somebody into your party; politic is a game of numbers,” he said. According to Oshiomhole, l have said it before that the deputy governor is doing damage to his principal. “I have to pay the price by staying away from the APC rally,” he said. The APC Chairman explained that he avoided the rally so that some persons would not have any excuse to go and  kill people and blame it on him. “We will not go to their level; blood for blood is not our mantra,” he added. The South South Vice chairman of the Party, Mr Hillard Etta, while presenting Ize-Iyamu to the national chairman of the party, said he was delighted to welcome lze-lyamu back to the party. “I never imagined that one day I will be performing this function because lze-lyamu was my boss. I did not see this coming,” he said. Also speaking, Pastor Ize-Iyamu thanked the national and state leadership of APC for welcoming him back home. Ize-Iyamu said “l have always said that l am not coming to cause confusion in APC but to come and join in strengthening the house l helped to build.” NAN
