Dairy manufacturer FrieslandCampina WAMCO has developed ‘mDairy App,’ a mobile software application to help dairy farmers perform better. The company developed the app in partnership with two Nigerian entrepreneurs (former students of the University of Ibadan) and three research students from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. The Dutch students are Margot Ridderikhoff, Jaap Dechering and Betsie Loeffen, while the mDairy’s co-founders from Nigeria are Oyewale Abioye and Gbadegesin Alawode. The Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, FrieslandCampina WAMCO, Mrs. Ore Famurewa, said the three students from the Delft University of Technology and the mDairy app co-founders are collaborating to support local dairy farmers at the company’s different Dairy Development Programme (DDP) sites. She explained that in 2017, FrieslandCampina WAMCO partnered with the Dutch-Nigerian Students Business Challenge, an initiative of the Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry and sponsored by corporations mainly of Dutch origin. The initiative, according to Famurewa, was aimed at addressing challenges in Nigeria’s health, energy and food sectors. She said having successfully completed and presented relevant business solutions, a new team of three students attached to FrieslandCampina WAMCO came to Nigeria recently to join Oyewale and Gbadegesin in order to deploy mDairy App, which DDP farmers can use with little or no challenge. Famurewa, in a statement, stated that to ensure that all farmers from various socio-economic backgrounds were integrated, the team was also developing an interactive voice message service which would facilitate easy access. “The mDairy app once deployed is designed to serve as one-stop-shop for DDP farmers’ information needs,” Famurewa explained.a
