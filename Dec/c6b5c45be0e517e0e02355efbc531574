 A FORMER Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) president Dr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) on Thursday called for the implementation of non-custodial provisions in the Nigerian Correctional Service Act 2019. The provisions entail that not all convictions will require imprisonment and that a committee on non-custodial sentencing be set up. In a letter to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mallam Abubakar Malami (SAN), Agbakoba praised the Federal Government for enacting the law. He said: “We are especially excited by the creation in the Act of the Nigerian Non-Custodial Service which is responsible for the administration of non-custodial measures, including community service, probation, parole, restorative justice measures, etc. “In many states, custodial sentence is still the main punishment for convicted offenders. “Given the many problems associated with custodial sentence, such as overcrowded prisons, cost of administering prisons, stigma, diseases, rape, etc, non-custodial measures have become globally accepted, especially for minor, petty or non-serious offences. “However, we are concerned that the National Committee on Non-Custodial Measures has not been appointed in line with Section 37(2) of the Nigerian Correctional Service Act 2019. “The Committee is important as it coordinates, monitors and proposes measures for the effective operation of non-custodial measures across the country. “We appeal that the National Committee on Non-Custodial Measures is expeditiously appointed as it is holding up implementation of non-custodial measures at federal and state correctional facilities.”
