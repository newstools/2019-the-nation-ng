In a statement issued by the chief press secretary to the governor, Chibuike Onyeukwu, Governor Ihedioha noted that, “in the spirit of one Imo, one destiny, it has become imperative for all citizens, especially my brothers who contested with me in the last election to sheathe their swords in the interest of our state. “The elections are over. Governance has taken centre stage and unfortunately, our case is a pathetic one, given that we are rebuilding a devastated state. “The situation calls for all hands to be on deck in a bid to make our state great again.” While congratulating the judiciary for upholding the truth in its landmark judgement, Governor Ihedioha commended the people of the state for their support and prayers since he assumed office.
