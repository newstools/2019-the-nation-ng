There is a cold war in the riverine Aboto community, Ilaje local government area of Ondo State over purported plan to impose one Beniah Idiogbe, as the Alaboto of Aboto. Already, another candidate, Prince Oyetayo Ofoaye, has been selected by kingmakers and elders in the community. A petition to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu through the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state from Thunderbolt Chambers, the solicitors for Aboto community and Ofoaye dated November 19, emphasised that Idiogbe being allegedly imposed is an indigene of Owo, and not entitled to Aboto throne. The petition was signed by the principal partner of the legal firm, Chief H.A Ogiren, on behalf of the community and Aboto-elect, Ofoaye. It noted that Ofoaye, having been properly selected by the kingmakers and elders of the communities, should be enthroned the new Alaboto. “With various evidences before us, we submit that if the welfare, the lives, properties and the peace of people of Aboto and its communities is of paramount importance to the state government, the planned imposition of Idiogbe should be stopped immediately. ”He (Idiogbe) is from Owo in the upland area of the state, but wanted to be imposed on Aboto in the riverine community because of his relationship with Governor Akeredolu.” A copy of the petition was also sent to the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mrs Lola Fagbemi. The state Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, could not be reached for comment on the petition.
