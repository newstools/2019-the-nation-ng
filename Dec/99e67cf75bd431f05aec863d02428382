Some know Prince Ned Nwoko as a Senator. Some know him as a billionaire with a golden heart. Others know him as the husband of Nollywood actress, Regina Daniel. One certain thing is that Nwoko is a successful businessman and he has everything money can buy. He doesn’t have any business to care for others but he cares. Recently at Wells Carlton Hotel in Abuja, the billionaire flagged off an initiative – Malaria Eradication Programme In Africa. Through Ned Nwoko Foundation, he is set to free Nigeria and Africa of the malaria plague, which has ended many lives prematurely. The businessman stated: “In this project, we will work with national and multilateral organisations. We will equally collaborate with governments, private organizations and civil society towards achieving our core objective of extending malaria intervention programmes beyond the threshold of control and palliatives. We have our eyes fixed on permanent solution to the age-long scourge. Prince Ned Nwoko Foundation, according to him, is committed to rendering support and services to the needy and humanity at large.  He added: “In the course of our various interventions, we discovered that malaria scourge constitutes one of the greatest impediments to the general wellbeing and development of Africans and their societies. Most health challenges suffered by Africans are directly or indirectly traceable to malaria. Also, the parasitic disease causes huge economic loss by draining considerable funds that could have been used for support growth and general societal development. Malaria does not only cause loss of life but also interferes with athleticism, socio-economical activities and general way of life of the people over sustained period.”
