French Ligue 1 club Lille have announced that striker Victor Osimhen is “back to normal” after he was rushed to hospital Tuesday night. Osimhen opened scoring for Lille in their 3-0 win at AS Monaco to send them through to the last eight of the French League Cup. However, he was replaced after just 23 minutes and then taken to hospital when he complained of being unwell. “Victor experienced dizziness and some pain and was taken to hospital,” Lille quoted Coach Christophe Galtier on their official Twitter account. “We just got news that everything is back to normal. We talked with him and he’s fine now.” With his goals this season in France, the Nigerian international has attracted several top European clubs including Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur. Meanwhile, ScoreNigeria.com reports that Belgian club Sporting Charleroi will receive 15 per cent on the next transfer of Victor Osimhen, according to media reports in Belgium. Last season, Charleroi took a chance on Osimhen after he became surplus to requirement at Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The striker justified the confidence of the Belgian club by scoring 19 goals in the league on loan, which caused his big-money transfer to Lille. He has most recently been linked to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur after new manager Jose Mourinho made him a top transfer target for the January window.
