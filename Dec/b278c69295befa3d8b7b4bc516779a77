Senator Barau told his colleagues in the Senate that the committee adopted the 2020-2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP) as approved by the National Assembly. He said the committee worked in tandem with the Executive in the consideration of the Bill especially in additional revenue projection to fund critical projects. He said the increase  in the budget was to  allow for interventions in areas like national security, road infrastructure, mines and steel development, health, social needs among others. Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriation, Muktar Betara, said it was important that the committee worked in harmony with the Executive in the processing of the bill which ensured the collaboration of the two arms in the utilisation of additional revenue projections to fund the budget. Senate President Ahmad Lawan commended his colleagues for the swift consideration and passage of the budget in a record time. He said:“When we came in, all of us approved our legislative agenda, and one of the key pillars of this agenda is to take back our budget cycle from the very undesirable cycle. “Today, we have been able to achieve this. It means where there is will, there is always a way. This is something that we have been able to achieve together with the House of Representatives. I must give members of the National Assembly the credit, because we thought it was going to be impossible. Let me also commend the buying-in of the executive arm of government. When we continued to preach that we have to receive the 2020 budget estimates before the end of September, it was not easy for the executive. “I know they (Executive) worked day and night. So it was presented to us on the 8th of October. We have been able to work harmoniously. There is no way we can achieve this without all of us working together. “I want to commend our colleagues from the opposition. This Senate from the beginning, we said, will be bi-partisan. You have given us all the support that we require, and indeed, this is the way it should be”, Lawan added. He said the recent passage of what he described as landmark legislations such as the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Act, Finance Bills and Public Procurement Bills by the National Assembly, the Executive arm of government is sufficiently empowered to ensure the successful implementation of the 2020 budget.
