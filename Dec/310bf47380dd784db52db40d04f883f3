LAGOS State Government has issued a stern warning to traffic offenders attacking men of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) on duty. Henceforth, the government stated it would not treat violent attacks on State’s law enforcers with kid gloves, saying anyone who dares to attack security and road traffic officers in the line of duty will regret the action. The warning followed a recent spate of violent incidents against LASTMA officers on duty. At the weekend, a hit-and-run driver knocked down a LASTMA officer on duty. The officer, Amos Adebisi, suffered deep bruises on his face and arms. The incident happened when the victim was trying to effect the arrest of an O-Pay rider who drove on the BRT lane in Ojota. Adebisi was taking the confiscated motorcycle to LASTMA office at Oshodi when the primero bus hit him at Idi-Iroko axis of Ikorodu Road. The officer was unconscious momentarily after the impact, while the bus driver sped off. Passersby rushed the officer to the LASTMA clinic before he was referred to the General Hospital in Isolo. After the accident, it was gathered that the O-Pay rider moved to the scene to retrieve the seized motorcycle before the back-up team of LASTMA arrived on the scene. At the time of this report, the injured officer was still receiving treatment at the General Hospital, although his condition had stabilised. It was gathered that LASTMA officers are on the trail of the bus driver and O-Pay rider. This incident preceded another violent episode against a LASTMA officer, Ola Oyeshina, who died in the early hours of Saturday after two trailer drivers attacked him in Iganmu-Sifax area of Apapa. Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Transportation, Mr. Toyin Fayinka condemned the attacks on the LASTMA officers, describing them as “dastardly acts”.
