 THE Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has cautioned the factional President of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) Ibrahim Gusau to desist from making  provocative statements capable of causing crisis, reiterating  its statutory responsibilities for formulation , supervision , implementation,  monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes on Sports administration in the country. According to the press statement signed by the Permanent Secretary Olusade Adesola , the Sports Ministry noted:” the meeting held on 3RD  of December 2019 of the AFN and signed by the Secretary General Prince Adeniyi A. Beyioku was duly convened, that the seven (7) Board members met at the AFN Secretariat and that three (3) members sent apologies. “The board in the absence of the President, mandated the Vice President Olamide George to preside over the proceedings of the board in acting capacity, the several violations by the President of the Constitution of the Federation Code of Governance and extant rules, the unanimous decision reached by the Board suspending the President arising from infractions, and the setting up of a five man investigative panel to report to the next Board meeting of its findings.” The FMYSD hereby reinstates that it has statutory responsibilities for the formulation, supervision, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes on Sports administration in the country. Olusade said while the ministry acknowledged that National Sports Federations are independent in the administration of their day to day activities, no National Sports Federation can be said to be autonomous of Government due to the constitutional provisions as well as the appropriation support from the Federation Account of the Federal Government.
