 Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) on Wednesday dissociated itself from some lists of “successful applicants” for its recruitment. It described the release of the lists as the handiwork of fraudsters. Joseph Attah, NCS National Public Relations Officer, announced this in a statement to The Nation.
He described it as an “attempt to deceive and extort unsuspecting applicants”.
The spokesman warned that such recruitment websites are fake and should not be patronised by the public.
Attah, a Deputy Comptroller of Customs, said: “The attention of the Nigeria Customs Service has again been drawn to the unrepentant activities of internet fraudsters despite several scam alerts by NCS.
“Recent activities of these elements show criminal ingenuity, presenting fake platforms that appears seemingly genuine to deceive and extort unsuspecting applicants that the Service has released short-listed names for recruitment examination/interview. “For the umpteenth time, NCS wishes to state that these recruitment websites/platforms are fake and should not be patronised.” “Members of the public will recall that we denied several similar fake vacancies advertisement with a promise to properly inform the public whenever we are ready. A promise we kept by advertising the vacancies in seven National newspapers.
“NCS is again warning against patronage of any release of short-listed candidates with a promise of letting successfully short-listed candidates know through their email addresses and telephone numbers soon.
Additionally, such official release will be news item in all NCS programmes on TV and Radio stations.
“Accordingly, all applicants are advised to disregard any invitation for recruitment examination/interview and wait patiently for the official release and invitation from the Service, please,” he said.
