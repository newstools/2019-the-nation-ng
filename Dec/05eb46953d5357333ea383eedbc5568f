 PASSPORT Control Officer (PCO), Ikoyi Passport office, Lagos, Manir Yari has said the office will no longer tolerate the activities of touts within the office vicinity Yari told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos while appreciating the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) for the award given to him on December7 in Abuja during the service end of the year dinner and awards night. NAN reports that Yari was given the award of the service for Exemplary Leadership that entails the ability to simplify passport issuance process. Yari declared that NIS aims to eliminate the activities of the touts in the year 2020 – “The touts usually ambush innocent citizens on their way to the office with promises to get them international passports. “Such promise, most times, never worked thereby ending up in duping the citizens,” he said. The PCO, therefore, pleaded with Nigerians, who were desirous of obtaining international passports, to visit the Centre directly. He said the Passport Office would strengthen its existing structures to improve service delivery in 2020. “The particular area we plan to intensify effort on is curbing the activities of quacks who hijack applicants. “The office had taken some measures already but the measures would be intensified come year 2020. Yari promised to exceed 2019 delivery by issuing more passports to applicants in 2020. “Since the issuance of e-passports began in Ikoyi, more than 50,000 passports have been issued to applicants for passports with both five years and 10 years validity,’’ he stated.
