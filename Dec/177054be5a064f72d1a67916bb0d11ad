Osagie Otabor, Bénin  The All Progressives Congress in Edo State loyal to National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has insisted that the mega rally to receive defectors from the Peoples Democratic Party would hold as planned. It said all the needed conditions for the rally to hold have been met. Publicity Secretary of the Edo APC, Mr. Chris Azebamwan said Barr Anselm Ojezua was no longer competent to speak as State Chairman of the party haven been removed from office. Azebamwan advised members of the public to ignore Ojezua’s statement denouncing the planned rally. According to him, “Anselm Ojezua seized to exist as the state chairman of the APC since November 11 when 11 members of the State Working Committee passed a vote of no confidence on him which has since been ratified by the relevant organs of the party. “The leadership of the APC have met and we agreed that the rally is going on to receive new members who are planning to join us. Are there no other parties in the state, don’t they hold rallies? Do they need to take permission or inform the state government that they are doing rallies? In this circumstance of holding a rally, all you need to do is to inform and get the permission of the police which we have done so the rally is going to hold” he said. But a source closed to Ojezua challenged Azebamwan and others to hold meeting at the party secretariat in Bénin City. “When they said they met, is it in Abuja where Oshiomhole is feeding them you hold State party meetings? Ojezua remains the party chairman and he has directed APC members not to attend.”
