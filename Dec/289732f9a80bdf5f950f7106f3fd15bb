Leicester were dealt huge a blow in the Premier League title race as they were held to a draw by a battling Norwich at King Power Stadium. The Foxes, who remain second, now lie 10 points behind league leaders Liverpool, following their hard-fought win over Watford in Saturday’s early game. Norwich, who were impressive, deservedly took the lead when Teemu Pukki slotted home after being sent through by Emiliano Buendia. But their lead only lasted 12 minutes as Leicester equalised when Jamie Vardy’s bullet header was turned into the net by Norwich keeper Tim Krul. Both sides pressed for a winner in an entertaining second half, with Vardy twice going close, but neither side could find a way through. The point sees Norwich close the gap on Aston Villa and Southampton, who play in Saturday’s late game, to three points but they remain 19th. Norwich have already lost to fellow Premier League strugglers Southampton, Watford and West Ham this season, preferring, it seems, to save their best performances for the big games. Having taken points off Manchester City, Arsenal and Everton, they continued the trend at Leicester and produced a fine performance against the division’s in-form side. They played with confidence throughout and, while there were a few nervy moments at the back, they threatened the Foxes’ goal consistently.
