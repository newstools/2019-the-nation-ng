Onimisi Alao, Yola The newly elected chairmen for the 21 local government councils of Adamawa State have been sworn in. The chairmen, whose victories were announced Sunday evening following council election that took place on Saturday, had their certificates of return issued to them Monday morning,. The ceremony at which they were sworn in took place at the Mahmud Ribadu Square in Yola later on Monday. Speaking during the ceremony, the state governor, Rt Hon Ahmadu Fintiri, charged them to deliver good governance to the people who voted them into office. He urged them not to be travelling chairmen but to stay back at their respective council areas and embrace everyone within their jurisdiction. The Executive Chairman of Michika Local Government, Hon Michael Shehu, who spoke on behalf of all the chairmen, thanked Adamawa people for electing them to serve. The oath of office was administered on the chairmen by the State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Barr Afraimu Jingi. The council chairmen all emerged from the ruling PDP, according to the Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) which conducted the election. Their election has generated much condemnation from the main opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) which called the election a sham and vowed to move against it. The party’s legal adviser, Mr Shagnah Pwamaddi, had said, “The recently conducted election is a complete sham, undemocratic and below standard of what we call election. This is selection that was perpetrated under intimidation and inducement. We are not going to accept it.”
