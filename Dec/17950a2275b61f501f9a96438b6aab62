Employees of a first generation bank at Mpape in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are being grilled by the police over their alleged involvement in a botched robbery attempt on the bank last Saturday. A source said it was curious how the robbers gained access to the bank on a non-working day and some top officials suspected to have colluded with them were being questioned. Last Saturday, one robber was killed and four others arrested after a team of policemen and soldiers foiled their attempt to rob the bank. Some workers of the bank, who were on duty on that day, had been arrested by the police for questioning. A statement by the Deputy Public Relations Officer of the FCT Police Command, Yusuf Mariam, indicated that “the Commissioner of Police has ordered a discreet investigation of the incident.”
