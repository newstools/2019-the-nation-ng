Ozolua Uhakheme SAP Nigeria, a German multinational software corporation recently brought joy to students in the Yaba axis of Lagos when it donated an ICT Hub in the vicinity. This is the second donations in recent time. SAP West Africa’s Marketing Manager, Mrs Juliet Omorodion, said: “Our vision is to help the world run better and improve people’s lives and we recently brought this to life when SAP Nigeria donated a sixteen-seater ICT hub to the All Saints Anglican Primary School, Yaba, that will serve six other schools within the district.” SAP Nigeria has therefore demonstrated its CSR duties through volunteerism and philanthropy by encouraging their employees to give of themselves and their time without the expectation of financial gain. This, she said, is in line with the three key pillars of CSR at SAP – Building digital skills, helping non-profits and social enterprises run better, and connecting our employees with purpose. Mrs Linda Umanah, representing the Educational Secretary for Lagos Mainland said that the donation was “welcome in this age of smart technology.” She expressed optimism that other companies will replicate this laudable initiative put forward by SAP Nigeria. Earlier, Mrs Omorodion noted that partnering with Ayeci Africa for the execution was essential as “there is need to continue teaching digital skills to children in line with the governments objective to introduce digital skills within the educational system.” This is in line with the NGOs objective of delivering the gift of literacy to pupils across the country. She further mentioned that activities will be ongoing at the facility through the teaching of coding and robotics by Coderina. Mrs Ifeoma Adibe-Chukwuka, founder Ayeci Africa, said their non-profit organisation “facilitates educational intervention for indigent students.”
