An order to sustain the dislodgement of squatters and illegal structures on Outer Marina and Onikan, the State Government has deployed not less than 60 operatives of the three enforcement agencies of the State to the various points of Onikan and Outer Marina for sustenance. The latest move has been made possible through the creation of a synergy between the operatives of Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (KAI), Lagos Neighbourhood Watch and Lagos State Parks and Gardens to sustain all the cleared areas. This was disclosed by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello on Wednesday while giving an update on the on-going operation. He stated that the State has also obtained the buy-in of the Office of the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 2 at Onikan to ensure the success of the sustenance operation. Bello said on a daily basis, detachments of the operatives of KAI, Neighbourhood Watch and LASPARK will be deployed to man and patrol the listed areas and prevent the return of the environmental nuisances. He explained that in instances where the deployed teams have issues that bother on their safety or operations, they should call for reinforcement from their superiors.
