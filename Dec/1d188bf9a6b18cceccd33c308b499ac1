Anthony Joshua’s total dominance in his victory over Andy Ruiz has been completely revealed after the punching statistics from the fight have been released. British superstar Joshua claimed a 118-110, 119-109, 118-110 points decision to regain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles – having lost them to Ruiz Jr in June. Joshua ranked the victory as the second best of his career – just behind his famous win over Wladimir Klitschko. “I have the utmost respect for Andy Ruiz who beat me fair and square in the first exam – I failed the first time but I came back and studied him and passed this time. This ranks second. The first would be my fight against Wladimir Klitschko – it means so much to me and I learned so much from that fight. “I respect Wladimir so much and he still gives me so much advice. This fight ranks number two though. “I know that my fans like to see me knock people out and I can do that but sometimes with certain fighters you have to box smarter,” said Joshua. “I understand what Andy brought to the table so I had to decapitate him in a different way.” Eddie Hearn added: “It’s the individual, anyone around him knows he’s the nicest bloke you could meet. “Madison Square Garden was a humiliation, he went down four times – people wrote him off, said he had no heart, he quit. He went back, brushed himself down and went back to work to prove you all wrong. “It was an absolute master class, a shutout, a way of boxing people didn’t believe he could do. He taught himself to box like that, the discipline was incredible. All the things no one thought he possessed – that’s because he’s getting better. “What heavyweight has resume like him? Give him respect; he has changed the face of boxing. A great individual with a big heart. I have represented Anthony since he turned pro. He is a very close friend of mine. The strength he has shown is unbelievable. “When was the last time we had a role model like this? We should be so proud. An absolute role model for our country.”
