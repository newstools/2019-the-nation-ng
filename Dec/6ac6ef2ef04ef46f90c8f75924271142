The Lagos High Court, Igbosere, has dismissed suit against Barrister Oluyomi Olawore. Going by the judgment delivered by Justice Adeniyi Onigbanjo of the Lagos State High Court, Igbosere on July 4, 2019, Onigbanjo said the applicant, Olakunle Karimu had no evidence to support the claims that his former employer, Oluyomi Olawore had ordered a police assault on him. While demanding N13 million as compensation, Karimu had filed a suit challenging the violation of his fundamental rights before the court, alleging Olawore, his former boss to have sponsored police brutality against him over the opening of a crossed cheque meant to serve as his severance package. The video of the incident went viral last year. In dismissing the suit, the court held that there is “no merit in the applicant claims against the respondent for alleged breach of his fundamental rights in the manner complained about in this suit.”
