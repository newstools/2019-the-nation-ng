 GUNMEN have kidnapped the wife of a traditional ruler, Oba Rufus Olugboyega Akinrinmade, the Orunja of Odigbo kingdom in Ondo State, Olori Regina Akinrinmade. They also reportedly abducted his two daughters, Mercy and Precious, as well as his driver. It was learnt that the ‘Olori’, daughters and the driver were kidnapped last Saturday at Oba Akoko on their way to Akungba Akoko to pick one of the children, a student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko. Oba Akinrinmade said the abductors had called him, demanding N10 million ransom. The royal father, who said the matter had been reported to the police, urged the command to rescue the victims. Police spokesman Femi Joseph, a Superintendent of Police (SP), could not be reached for reaction last night.
