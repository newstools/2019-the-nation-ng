A STAR player of the Ikoyi Club tennis team taking part in the international tennis contest between the club and their host, Accra Lawn Tennis Club, Kelvin Obiegbunam, has expressed delight about the on-going tourney. Obiegbunam says the advantages of the international competition cannot be quantified in any way. He said: “It is good to have a feel of what goes on in other parts. Our hosts here in Ghana have been wonderful and we expect to go back to Nigeria with good memories of this international contest. “We are also happy that there are things we can take back to implement in our prestigious club especially in the new year based on the little we have seen here. “Our members are so happy to be here and there has been plenty of good interaction that could yield fruits for some people in their respective businesses. This is a fantastic idea.” In the three day event, Rita Nwanye and Aminat Lawal are the female players expected to be in action in the colours of Ikoyi Club in Accra. In the Male Singles A and B category, Bola Ayorinde, Hilary Eledu and Effiong Ejehiwease are expected to vie for honours for the Nigerian representatives. Chairman of Ikoyi Club 1938, Bimbo Okubena, said that there were many positives on the trip to Ghana. “We are very happy that members are catching fun here in Accra as we interact with our friends here.
