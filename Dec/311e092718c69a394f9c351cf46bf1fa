Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) members have received their December salary despite not enrolling in the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) as directed by the Federal Government. ASUU National President Prof Biodun Ogunyemi confirmed the payment in his Christmas message to members of the union. The Federal Government, through the Office of the Accountant-General (OAGF) had threatened not to pay the December salary of any lecturer who failed to enrol in the IPPIS. However, the ASUU boss said his investigation showed that his colleagues were paid the salary even though they have not enrolled in the IPPIS. The ASUU President asked members to prepare for challenges ahead in 2020. He lamented that Nigerians find it difficult to make ends meet due to the harsh economy, stating that the situation has made life unbearable for the masses while the few rich continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the majority. According to Ogunyemi, the economy has hit the poor below the belt and made the yuletide period meaningless. He noted that celebration is more meaningful when the ordinary Nigerians have access to qualitative education, healthcare and other good things of life. Ogunyemi said: “Comrades and compatriots, as we join the rest of the world for the Christmas and New Year holidays, let’s look back with thanksgiving and prepare for the challenges of the future. The season of love reminds us of our obligations to the poor and downtrodden. “A celebration like this, is more meaningful when the ordinary Nigerians have access to qualitative education, healthcare, and other good things of life. Happy holidays, as the struggle continues!”
