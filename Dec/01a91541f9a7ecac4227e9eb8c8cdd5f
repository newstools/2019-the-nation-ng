The House Committee on Appropriation on Wednesday laid the final 2020 budget estimate before the House of Representatives for consideration. The report on the budget estimate which was supposed to have been laid before the House on November 28 was shifted to December 3 and later December 4 as a result of the death of a member of the house. Chairman of the Appropriation Committee, Hon. Muktar Betara (APC, Borno) laid the report before the house at resumption of plenary on Wednesday. Presenting the report, Hon. Betara said N10.594 trillion has been approved as budget for the year 2020, with N2.7 trillion of the money meant for debt service, while N4.8 trillion is for non-debt expenditure. He also disclosed that N2.4 trillion of the money will go as contribution to the capital development fund expenditure for the year. The report presented to the house is a collation from the various house committees from budget defence by government ministries department and agencies. The House has said it wants to pass the 2020 budget before the end of the year as a way of returning the country to a January to December budget circle. A date was however not fixed for final debate and possible passage of the budget, but there are expectations that the House may commence final debate on the document during its sitting on Thursday.
