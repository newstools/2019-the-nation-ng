By Rukayat Omoro STUDENTS  of the Fountain University, Osogbo, will not forget in a hurry their experience last Wednesday with snakes. At 8:54pm some female students who went to get food from the school cafeteria, saw a big snake in the bush. It was claimed that the snake passed between a male and female student who stood talking in front of the hostel gate. The screams of the student who saw the snake first drew the attention of other students who were outside the gate and the school’s security unit called Farsars. The security men quickly rushed to help the students, using a very huge bamboo stick to hit the snake until it died. About 20 minutes later, at exactly 9:15pm, another snake was found in one of the rooms in the hostel. All five members were in the room at the time.  One of them who saw the snake quickly notified others and FARSARS visited again.  However, they could not find the snake after several hours of searching. The occupants of the room were asked to vacate the room until the snake was found. There have been more reports of snake sighting lately. The university has promised to take preventive measures as quickly as possible to avoid any further complaints of snakes in the hostel, especially the bathroom.
