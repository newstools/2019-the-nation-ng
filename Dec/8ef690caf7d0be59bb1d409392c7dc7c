Frank Ikpefan, Abuja The West African Examinations Council has withdrawn the certificates of ten candidates who were alleged to have been involved in examination malpractices. The certificates of the candidates withdrawn included those who wrote the examination between December 1992 to 2014. The names of the affected candidates, their examination years and certificate numbers were published on the Monday bulletin of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board. The JAMB bulletin was released to reporters by the board’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin in Abuja yesterday. The bulletin identified impersonation as the nature of the malpractices allegedly perpetrated by the candidates, leading to the withdrawal of their certificates. Some of the candidates affected include: Ukaumunna C. December 1992 examination with certificate number, NGSP 0233613; Chinna H. December 1993 with certificate number, NGSP 0572427; Koffi E.

JAMB noted that it had partnered with the National Identity Management Commission to enforce candidates’ registration for the National Identity Number, in order to avoid such impersonations. The board said: “In view of the cases listed that JAMB’s partnership with NIMC is imperative. In order to have a seamless registration for the 2020 UTME, we have put machinery in place to test run the new registration regime under the joint platform of JAMB and NIMC using the NIN. “The Registrar, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, sequel to this, therefore directed members of staff in offices nationwide to participate in the trial registration which started Friday, November 29, and is to end Tuesday, December 3. No fewer than 1,800 members of staff would be involved in the trial registration designed to assess the workability of the new registration regime.”
