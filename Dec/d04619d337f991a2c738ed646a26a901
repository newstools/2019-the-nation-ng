An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Thursday sentenced two men, Biodun Ademoye, 18, and Abiodun Omotosho, 27, to two years imprisonment each for attacking a policeman with weapons. Magistrate B.O. Osunsanmi sentenced the duo after they pleaded guilty to a four-count charge of conspiracy, assault, extortion and a breach of the peace. Osunsanmi ruled that the convicts should serve out their jail terms without an option of fine. The magistrate delivering her judgment said, “You are hereby sentenced to two years’ imprisonment each without an option of fine. “The sentence will serve as a deterrent to others who may want to engage in similar acts.” The prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, had told the court that the defendants committed the offences with some other persons still at large on November 14, at Boladale Street in Oshodi, Lagos State.
