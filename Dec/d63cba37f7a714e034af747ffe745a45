Contrary to widespread calls for release of the Convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, renowned Labour leader, Comrade Issa Aremu, has faulted the former presidential candidate for flouting the rule of law himself. He spoke in Kaduna state on Thursday during commemoration of International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) organised by National Union of Textile Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGTWN). Aremu, who is The General Secretary of NUTGTWN, argued obeying the rule of law is a two- way traffic. He said government and citizens must obey court orders to have sane community. He argued that calling for immediate revolution is unacceptable because the only way to change a government is through democratic process. Aremu said: “He contested election under a democracy government, now he is calling for forceful removal the same government. “If he was not lucky in the last election he should wait for the another time, I also contested in the election and not successful but we are not going to call for revolution now because it is undemocratic. “So he should obey the rules of law by doing what is acceptable in the law.”
