Our Reporter  Executive Director, Schlumberger Nigeria Limited, Mr. Nosa Omorodion, has lamented the poor funding of Nigerian universities, saying the country’s 2019 budget allocation for education was less than half of Harvard University’s. He said this at the 11th Convocation of Crawford University, Igbesa in Ogun State, last Wednesday. Omorodion, in his lecture entitled: “We are all explorationists: when all you need to discover is you”, said: “Universities in Nigeria have historically been faced with underfunding. The 2019 Federal Education budget for the country is less than half of that of Harvard University for the same year. It is glaring how we are inadvertently scuttling the future of the next generation.” He urged the graduates to discover themselves and aim to transform the world through Science, Arts and Technology. Thirty two of the 243 graduates had First Class.  The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Isaac Ajayi,  said 91 graduated with Second Class Upper Division; 80 Second Class Lower Division; while the Third Class Division had 40 students. Twenty-four students were awarded postgraduate diplomas and Master’s in various disciplines. Prof. Ajayi said the university was committed to entrepreneurial training and innovation for its students to make positive impact on the global economy. “We continue to pursue entrepreneurial training and innovation to ensure our students are relevant and have a positive impact on the global economy,” he said. The Chancellor, Revd Emmanuel Adeniran, stressed the importance of education to students, parents and the labour market. He said: “Graduates from universities should have certain unique, flexible and peculiar skills that aid their career and economic survival.  This will be the anchor for a stable and sustainable career and employment on graduation. “Then, university education should serve the needs of its most strategic customers, the students, parents and labour market.”
