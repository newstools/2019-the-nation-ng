During the operation, the troops had a meeting engagement with elements of the Boko Haram criminals and a fire fight ensued. “The Boko Haram insurgents were decisively dealt with, forcing them to hurriedly flee the location in disarray. Troops destroyed all of the criminals’ structures, farmland, harvested grains stored in underground bunkers and one Lister grinding machine. In another encounter at Fadama Village, the criminals’ flag hoisted on a tree was captured and immediately lowered after the troops had effectively subdued the criminal insurgents with superior fire power forcing them to flee in disarray. Items recovered from the criminals include 2 bicycles, copies of Quran and several other personal effects. Interestingly, no causality was recorded by the gallant troops.” The statement added that, “similarly, the troops of 151 Bn, Sector 1 Operation LAFIYA DOLE handed a humiliating defeat to a bunch of Boko Haram criminal insurgents in the early hours of 25th December 2019 while on clearance operation conducted deep into the Sambisa Forest. During the encounter, one Boko Haram suicide bomber tried to force himself into the troops’ firm base, but the gallant troops aborted this heinous intent by promptly neutralising him and his cohorts with effective fire in the general area. The Improvised Explosive Device strapped to his body got detonated in the process and his body parts were found scattered across the field.
