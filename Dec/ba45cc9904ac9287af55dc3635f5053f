The late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu was the APC Senator representing Imo North Senatorial District. “Many who crossed path with the late Senator described him as pleasant and accommodating. He was an astute politician, fine lawmaker, social crusader, successful businessman, humanitarian and a philanthropist. “As former Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, the late Senator Uwajumogu was known for his commitment to the promotion of legislation to enhance good governance, particularly in the area of education, infrastructure and social amenities “He was one of the front line party leaders that worked assiduously to entrench the APC in the South East.

We pray the Almighty God grants the late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu eternal rest and also give us all the strength to bear this painful loss.”
