Many people knew the late Dr. Ore Falomo as MKO Abiola’s physician but he was more than that in his lifespan. He was generous and had friends from all walks of life. At his service of songs held on Wednesday at Maryland Specialist Hospital, Lagos, family and friends were given the opportunity to say one or two things about him. In his sermon, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo described Falomo as a strict disciplinarian, committed patriot and fervent Christian. Urging the children to follow their father’s path, the pastor advised them to shun any error that he might have committed before death took him away. These errors, he observed, had been generating discord in the family but he didn’t see any need for them to quarrel over their father’s belongings. Also at the service of songs were former Governor of Ogun State, Aremo Olusegun Osoba; top businessman, Prince Jide Adeniyi; Chief Gani Fawehinmi’s son, Mohammed; Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu; Former Lagos Commissioner, Dr. Lakan Pitan, among others.
