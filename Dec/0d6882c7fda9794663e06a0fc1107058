By Patience Wilfred and Mcdouggie Ekperikpe Newly admitted students of Akwa Ibom State University (AKSU) gathered last Sunday on campus to praise God for seeing a new month and gaining admission into the university. The thanksgiving session was chaired by Dr. Monday Dickson, dean of Studentsâ€™ Affairs.  Some of the freshers who identified themselves as Treasure Reuben, Grace Dennis, Noble Udoma and Eunice Ibanga told CampusLife they were excited to be among the few chosen by the university. They all promised to abide by the rules and regulations of the institution.
