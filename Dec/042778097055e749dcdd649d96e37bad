Sunny Nwankwo, Aba  The driver of a commercial truck has reportedly killed a yet-to-be-identified man along Azumini-Opobo road in Aba, Abia State. The Nation gathered that the driver of the vehicle in an attempt to avoid being lynched ran away from the scene of the incident. An eyewitness who simply gave his name as Chima while narrating how the accident happened said “the man (deceased) was walking along the road when suddenly the truck came and hit him. “The man fell on the ground and while the car was coming back after hitting a barricade on the road, crushed the man’s head. “The man was already on the ground and couldn’t have stood up immediately. Nobody knew that the car was going to move back to crush the man’s head. Everything just happened in flash. “The driver of the truck ran away from the scene in apparent moves to run away from being lynched as mob was rushing to the scene of the accident. “We later discover that the man works in a block industry. “From what we got, the car’s thyroid developed a fault and in the bid to control his car, the driver swerved off the road to hit the man who was walking by the roadside. The truth is that the car is rickety and shouldn’t have been on the road. I am pretty sure that the thyroid would have given him sign over the weeks or even months before it eventually led to the event that led to the death of the innocent man. “Policemen from Azuka Police Station came to the scene and eventually left after some time. Some persons who may have known the deceased man arrived at the scene and after placing some calls, an ambulance came to carry off the deceased body from the scene.” The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Azuka Police Station could not be reached for comments, but a source at the division said that they were investigating the matter adding that they were working to ensure that the driver of the truck was arrested. When our reporter arrived the scene, the truck and body of the deceased were no longer there.
