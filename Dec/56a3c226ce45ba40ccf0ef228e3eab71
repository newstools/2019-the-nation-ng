LEICESTER City defender Jonny Evans has praised Nigeria International Kelechi Iheanacho goal against Aston Villa on Sunday and believes his side’s determination to be successful has resulted in them becoming the most in-form side in England’s top tier. A resurgent Iheanacho continued his brilliant form in front of goal after scoring and assisting for Leicester City in their 4-1 win over Aston Villa in his first start of the season on Sunday afternoon. The 23 year-old had earlier marked his first Leicester City league appearance of the season with an assist and a last-ditch winner against Everton after coming in as a substitute on December 1. “It was a bit of a battle, a scrappy game, it was probably difficult for the referee, but, I thought once we settled into it and we had some great opportunities on the break and even the first goal on the break, the second one was a great team goal, passing the ball through the lines and a good finish by Kel (Kelechi Iheanacho),” Evans told LCFC TV “I thought we played really well today. We had to ride it out, it was quite a difficult start to the game. The weather was coming down, [there was] wind [and] rain. “I think the last game we lost was Liverpool and we were really, really gutted that day [with] the way it ended at the end of the game. “I think it gave us a real incentive to come back after that. I think it was just after the international break, so we came back, and we’ve performed tremendously since then.”
