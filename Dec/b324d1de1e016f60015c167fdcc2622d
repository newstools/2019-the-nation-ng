A 38-year old businessman, Mr. Iziengbe Ehigie, who was attacked by thugs on Wednesday night, has called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Adamu Mohammed, to intervene. He alleged that he was detained at the Ugbekun Police Division despite being the complainant and the police collected N30,000 from him to bail him out. Ehigie said policemen at the station refused to investigate the attempted murder he reported, but turned around to detain him despite the injuries he sustained. Narrating what happened, he said he was driving home alongside his friend when some boys accosted him and attacked him with weapons. Ehigie said it was his cry for help that made officials of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to come to his aid, adding that four of the attackers fled, but two were apprehended. He said the two attackers were taken to the Ugbekun Police Station. “I was surprised when I came the next day and the DPO asked me to give my statement and after that she said it was a case of two fighting. I asked them to investigate the matter properly, but they detained me. “My friend told me the two suspects were released. This is painful for me as a complainant and because of the way I was beaten. The police detained me even when they saw my injury. “I want the IGP to investigate the matter. I want to know why I was attacked. I did not provoke those boys, but the DPO said it was a case of two fighting.” Edo State Police Command spokesman DSP Chidi Nwabuzor could not be reached for comments.
