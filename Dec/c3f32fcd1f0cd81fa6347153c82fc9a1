Former Aston Villa and England striker, Darren Bent Alex Iwobi has shown he can produce the quality expected but that such displays are too few and far between. Iwobi played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday night’s 5-2 defeat to Merseyside rivals Liverpool in what was Marco Silva’s final game in charge of the Toffees. Bent says that Iwobi showed brief flashes of his ability at Anfield but that his inconsistent displays are something the Toffees could do without right now. “He worked hard and got into the Arsenal first-team but if he wasn’t at Arsenal, would they have signed him? No, never,” Bent told Football Insider. “It’s inconsistency but I genuinely believe it’s a real lack of quality as well. He played two unbelievable passes (against Liverpool) – one to Moise Kean round the corner which put him free and the other to Calvert-Lewin which drew a foul from van Dijk. “Other than that, he is so inconsistent. Sometimes his quality, when he crosses, isn’t good enough, he hits the first man and he doesn’t know whether to shoot or to pass. He’s another indifferent player Everton don’t need right now. “When you’re in a relegation battle, you need players who know their jobs, you know what you’re going to get. Iwobi falls into the category of not knowing what you’re going to get.” After sitting out the opening two games of the season, Iwobi has featured in every single one of the Toffees’ Premier League outings so far, eight of those coming among the starting XI. He has scored just twice in his 16 appearances at Goodison Park so far, with a total of 12 strikes and 19 assists in 113 top-flight games.
