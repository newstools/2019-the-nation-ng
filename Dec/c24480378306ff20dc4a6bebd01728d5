As part of efforts to end open defecation, Reckitt Benckiser, makers of Harpic toilet cleaner and other household products, has launched its ‘Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet ‘ campaign in Abuja to commemorate the 2019 World Toilet Day. This it did in partnership with the Federal Government. The 2019 World Toilet Day has the theme: ‘Toilets for All – leaving no one behind’. A walk was held around Abuja to sensitise residents on proper toilet practices. Minister of Water Resource Sulaimon Adamu, at a news conference after the walk, thanked stakeholders for their support. He said the campaign is aimed at mobilising high level support and resources towards building a new culture of safe defecation. Adamu said he was concerned that Nigeria lagged behind other nations in terms of proper hygiene.
He lamented that about 47 million persons did not have direct access to toilets, especially as statistics by the World Health Organisation (WHO) said over 100,000 children die every year due to poor sanitation and unsafe water resulting in diarrhoea. Adamu said the ‘Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet’ campaign was aimed at advancing the people towards a new culture of safe defecation. The General Manager, RB Hygiene & Home West Africa, Mr. Asif Hashimi, said the provision of basic amenities is crucial in supporting the Federal Government’s plans towards ending open defecation. Said he: “There is need to build public toilets and support public awareness campaigns towards behavioral change, so that people start rejecting open defecation as a norm. Harpic, one of RB’s most notable brands, has reiterated the importance of having access to clean toilets. Today’s launch and the World Toilet Day commemoration are to raise awareness about those who don’t have access to safe toilets, despite it being their right. Toilets save lives because human waste spreads killer diseases.”
