Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakaliki Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Monday backed the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to close Nigerian borders. The Governor stated this during the Central Bank Account Opening Week, (AOW), at Onueke Township Stadium in Ezza South local government area of the State. According to him, the closure of the borders would boost the economic capacity of farmers, curtail the influx of foreign herdsmen into the country and minimise illegal dealings within the petroleum sector. Flagging off the exercise said the foreign rice being smuggled through the borders is dangerous for consumption. “You might know the amount of poison that is being smuggled into this country in the name of foreign rice.’ “Ebonyi has keyed into the programs of the CBN. I stand with the President on the closure of the border. The influx of foreign herdsmen into Nigeria will be restricted or allowed. By the closure, our farmers are happy. “You might know the amount of poison smuggled into this country in the name of foreign rice. I support president in the closure of the border. We are recouping our petroleum products. Our nation should not be a dumping ground. A lot of poison is being smuggled in the name of foreign rice into Ebonyi. “We have arrested many people in connection with smuggling of foreign rice into Ebonyi. We will obtain court order to burn the rice and also for the drivers of the truck to pay between N5m and N10m. “We must secure the LGA with CCTV. Every bank must be secure with CCTV cameras linked to a central point. Banks are owing us IGR to the tune of N6b,” he said. The account opening week is an initiative of the Bankers Committee, Financial services providers and all financial inclusion stakeholders in the state. The idea behind the AOW is to drive activities towards achieving the set target of financial inclusion for 2019.
