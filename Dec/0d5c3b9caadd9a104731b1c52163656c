The Lagos State Police Command has explained that House of Representatives member, Shina Peller was detained and arrested for allegedly mobilising thugs to invade a police station. The Punch reports that the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana accused Peller’s club, Quilox, of being fond of obstructing free flow of traffic in the state. He said after some of his customers’ vehicles caused gridlock on Monday, the police intervened by towing three of the vehicles. He said, “The honourable is the owner of that club and his customers are fond of parking on the road and blocking the road. If you want to pass that place, you will have tough times. “Up till 9am, the club was still on. They refused to remove their vehicles and Lagosians were seriously disturbed. Even Mr Governor was affected this morning. He had to manoeuvre his way through it. “This man had been talked to many times, but he refused to listen. This morning, our patrol vehicles towed three vehicles out of that place so that people could pass. “This honourable mobilised over 50 thugs to attack Maroko Police Station to move those vehicles out. We had to send reinforcement from neighbouring stations before they were able to curtail the situation. That was how he was arrested with five of the thugs, while others escaped. We had to exercise a lot of restraints. “They have been moved to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Panti, where they are being investigated.”
