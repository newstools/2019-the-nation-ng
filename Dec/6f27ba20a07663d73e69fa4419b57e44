 A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD chess champion, Miss Deborah Quickpen, who hails from Southern Ijaw, Bayelsa State, has received N750, 000 from the state’s Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon to enable her represent the country at a chess competition in Namibia. Lyon, who was represented by a former Commissioner and governorship aspirant, Prince Ebitimi Amgbare, presented the cheque to the Quickpen at the NUJ Press Centre, Yenagoa. The wonder kid is billed to represent Nigeria at the African Youth Chess Championship coming up in Namibia later in the month. The Bayelsa State chess coach, Kigigha Bomo, explained that Quickpen won gold and a bronze at this year’s National Sports Festival under category 15, which qualified her to represent Nigeria in Namibia. He thanked Lyon for funding the trip to Namibia and called on other well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to support the game. In his remarks, the Convener and Director-General of Miss Deborah Quickpen Support Group, Mr. Ada Gwegwe, said they were delighted that the governor-elect intervened to enable the kid represent the country in Namibia. The father of the wonder kid, Ben Quickpen, who is the current world’s number 10th in scrabble and a three-time national champion in the game, said he was surprised that Lyon came to the aide of his daughter.
