It said that the various sub-committees and the Appropriation Committee have been engaging commissioners and heads of government agencies on the defence of their votes in the Appropriation Bill. According to the House, the 2020 Budget of Lagos State will be passed by the Lagos State House of Assembly and possibly signed into law by Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu not later than January 2, 2020. Chairman of the House Committee on Information and Strategy Tunde Buraimoh dropped the hint in a chat with reporters at in Alausa, Ikeja. Buraimoh said: “The State Assembly was working hard to ensure that the budget’s estimates and proposals are passed not later than January, 2, 2020 so that executive can have ample time and opportunity to execute all the proposals that are contained in the budget. “The Lagos State House of Assembly because of its cognisance of responsibility to make the lots of the people good and that the good of the people to get better and the greatest happiness to go to the greatest number of people is cautious of the fact that, whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well and in good time. “And there is no point taking any day not to talk of any week or any month out of the 52 weeks or 12 months that makes a year. “So, the Lagos State House of Assembly is trying as much as possible to get the executive ready to action and to hit the Year 2020 running by making sure that the 2020 budget’s estimates and proposals are made into law on or before but not later than the first working day of January, 2020. “This is to allow the executive to have ample time and opportunity to execute all the proposals that are contained in the budget.”
