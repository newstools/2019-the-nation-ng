Our Reporter As part of initiatives to boost commerce and drive investment to the retail sector of the state, JARA Shopping Mall, a newcomer in the retail space in Edo State, is taking shape at the Sokponba Road axis of Benin City, with commercial operations set to begin before the end of the year. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the mall is the product of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the company and the Edo Development and Property Agency (EDPA) on behalf of the Edo State Government to expand the retail space in the state. He said construction work is complete with interior fittings being installed at the shopping mall, which promises to revolutionalise leisure and the shopping experience in the bubbling Sokponba axis of Benin City. According to him, “The State Government in the last three years has pioneered projects that would redefine Edo State as an investors’ delight and we have closed a number of projects in this regard. The JARA Shopping Mall is the latest in the bag. The construction work involved local labour and we are very sure that when the mall kicks off in earnest, more youths in the state would be employed at the facility. “We are indeed happy that the mall will change the landscape at the Sokponba axis of Benin City and will bring a new lease of life to the ever-busy, densely populated area.” He added that the mall is another proof of the ease of doing business reforms of the Governor Obaseki-led administration, as the facility would be up and running barely few months after the MoU for its operation was signed with the state government.
