Our Reporter  The International Trade Centre (ITC) and partners of the United Nations (UN) Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth have launched a joint Knowledge Facility to boost employment prospect of young people. ITC said the facility is a place for policymakers and practitioners to learn, share, and engage with youth employment themes through searchable and downloadable resources and tools. It builds on the work of existing knowledge platforms on youth employment, and maps and links resources and tools related to youth employment and allows users to manage knowledge of, and communicate about, youth employment interventions. “Our continued collaboration with the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth now features a new digital platform for young entrepreneurs and youth employment stakeholders alike,’ ITC Executive Director Arancha González said. The ITC boss added that “through knowledge sharing and providing access to relevant resources, we support young entrepreneurs in realising their business ideas.”  ITC has been part of the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth since its inauguration and continues to lead the thematic area on youth entrepreneurship. With the help of collaborative stakeholder action under the umbrella of the Global Initiative, ITC’s Youth & Trade Programme was able to create conversations and to generate results for young entrepreneurs across Africa and beyond. The UN Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth is the multi-stakeholder alliance to scale up action and impact on youth employment under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It brings together governments, social partners, youth and civil society organisations, the private sector, the UN System and others working together to share knowledge, leverage resources and take action at country and regional levels to support young people in accessing decent work and productive employment worldwide.
