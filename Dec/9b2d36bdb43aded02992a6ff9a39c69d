 THE Technical Adviser of Rangers International Football Club Salisu Yusuf has insisted that the team has a very good chance of qualifying from the group despite losing the first group match at home against Pyramid Football Club of Egypt in the CAF Confederation Cup. Salisu said he accepted to offer his services to the club because of the calibre of players in the team. He said the team hasn’t got much problem except building the confidence of the players. The former Kano Pillars tactician express belief that Rangers will be among the top three finishers in the ongoing Nigeria Football Professional League (NPFL) as the current standing on the log should not be used to judge the team. “You know Rangers is a great team known locally and internationally. We lost the Confederation Cup first leg 1-3 because the boys lost concentration not that they are not good. With the confidence and team spirit in camp now I can I assure you that the team will recover the three points away in the next game and qualify for the next round,” Salisu stated. The former Super Eagles Assistant Coach said the one year suspension has  thought him how to relate with people especially players and coaches.
