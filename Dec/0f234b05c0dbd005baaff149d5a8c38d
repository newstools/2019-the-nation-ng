The Akwa Ibom State government has arrested 180 persons and secured court judgment against 18 others for gender-based violence, it was said on Monday. Commissioner for Women Affairs and Agriculture Glory Edet who disclosed this to journalists in Uyo, the state capital, listed the offences to include rape, child abuse,  molestation and wife battery, adding that the passage of the Violence Against Persons (prohibited) law in Akwa Ibom State would check the crimes. She spoke at a press conference to commemorate this year’s  16 days of activism for the elimination of violence against women in Uyo. According  to her,  the state government has taken over the care of some of the children whose parents were convicted, in the case of those who had no one to care for them Edet, who is Dean of Commissioners and Special Advisers to the Governor, said nothing would prevent the state government from prosecuting sexual offenders against children and gender -based violence perpetrators. Adding that  the intent is to end violence against women by 2030. Edet said that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced physical and or sexual violence in their lifetime, while 11 percent of African women have experienced physical and sexual violence by an intimate partner.
