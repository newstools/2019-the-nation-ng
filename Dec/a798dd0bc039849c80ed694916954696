 Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Saturday said all structures within the government’s right of way in Lekki would be pulled down. The governor stated this while briefing correspondents after a tour of some areas in Lekki. He said most of the structures especially at Brownstone Estate had no building approvals and were erected illegally in total disregard of government’s master plan for the axis. Most were built on drainages and areas meant for roads thereby blocking the flow of water to the Lagoon causing flooding in the axis. “This alignment is called Lekki regional roads which is meant to be a relief assess road for the Lekki-Epe expressway, they have completely bastardized the right of way. “The right of way would ease traffic that will ensure that people can commune from one part of the city especially around this Lekki region to other parts”. The governor said that the ministry of physical planning would come to the area especially Brownstone Estate to ask them for building planning approvals, “the ones that don’t have we’ll mark for demolition. “This people are meant to be civilized, what i have seen here is a high level of irresponsibility, all of this people have shown that they do not have any regard for our urban master plan and government will not condone it. “Government certainly will not sit down and let people take undue advantage of our planning laws. Sanwo-Olu assured that government will not relax, “we will do all we have to do so that we can preserve the sanctity of the city and state and people that are law abiding must have respite”, Sanwo-Olu said.
