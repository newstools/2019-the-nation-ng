Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibadan zonal office, on Wednesday, busted a Lagos hotel believed to be a hideout for internet fraudsters. The target was one Rasaq Balogun, a suspected internet fraud kingpin. Balogun was said to harbour an army of young men recruited to carry out financial frauds through the internet. Some others were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, also in Lagos State. The raid on his hotel, Modzak Hotel, at Abule-Egba, Lagos State, sufficiently gave credence to the suspicion as a retinue of young men was caught in his hotel with no specific mission. The suspected kingpin and 26 other young men ranging between the ages of 18 and 35 years were arrested at the scene. Other suspects were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, Lagos from where they were all moved to the Ibadan zonal office of the Commission for further interrogation. Three vehicles, fetish items, laptops, mobile phones and documents suspected to contain fraudulent data from the suspect were also recovered. The commission said those indicted in the crime will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded.
