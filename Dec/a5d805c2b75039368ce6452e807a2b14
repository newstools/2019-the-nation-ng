In a release by the APC Zonal Publicity Secretary, Karounwi Oladapo, the APC National Vice Chairman, who doubles as the Chairman of the APC South West Caucus, Pastor Bankole Oluwajana, said that Ajimobi deserves all accolades that will be poured on him on this special occasion of his 70 years existence in the land of the living. The statement reads: “Ajimobi has a very intimidating credentials as a  private sector player, particularly in the oil business and in the Public service sector, he has always been a record breaker in Oyo State. He was a Senator and a two term Governor of Oyo State. These are records that no other person can claim or rival in Oyo State. Yes, Oyo State has produced many House of Representatives members, many Senators and Governors but only Abiola Ajimobi has a unique record of ruling Oyo State for eight years at a stretch and the first person to break the jinx of a second term of Governorship in Oyo State. This earned him the title of ‘KOSELERI GOVERNOR’ in Oyo State.” The South West APC leadership said they were proud of Ajimobi’s records of service in Oyo state and that they value his  contributions to the growth of APC in the State.They prayed God to give him health and more wisdom to render more services to the Party, APC, the Good people of Oyo State and Nigeria in general.
