Oyo State Commissioner for Public Works and Transportation Prof. Raphael Afonja has told road contractors that they have three months to do jobs that will be commensurate with the mobilisation funds they have received. He said the government would take steps to enforce contractual agreements signed at the beginning of their contracts. Prof Afonja, who spoke in Ibadan while inspecting road projects, said if after the expiration of the three months grace period, steps would be taken as regards some of the clauses stipulated in the initial agreement. “We are here to inspect the level of work done in relation to the mobilisation funds received by the contractors and with the spate of work, I am promising the contractors that government will not allow the funds to be misused. There were terms in the contract agreements signed by the government and the contractors when they were given the jobs. They will have to deliver on this,” he said.
