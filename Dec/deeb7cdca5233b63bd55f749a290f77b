The closure of Mile 2/TinCan road for palliative work on the bad portions which has already commenced will not exceed three days, Lagos State Government has stated. Commissioner for Transportation Dr Frederic Oladeinde on Sunday appealed to the residents and people working around the axis to bear with the government, “The pains were for good.” Oladeinde attributed the frequent accidents by articulated vehicles and trucks in the area to the deplorable condition of the road. He stressed that there was an urgent need to allow the Federal Government to carry out the palliatives so as to ease traffic congestion and prevent further incidents in that axis. The Commissioner assured the public that various law enforcement agencies including the Lagos State Transport Management Authority, (LASTMA) and the Police will be on ground to direct traffic and manage the situation. He added that his men would supervise the works to ensure that the closure does not exceed three days as planned. While appealing to commuters, truck owners and other stakeholders to bear the pains, Oladeinde urged them to take note of this traffic arrangement and comply accordingly, adding that any inconvenience arising from this closure was regrettable as the effort is aimed at improving on daily vehicular movement in that region.
