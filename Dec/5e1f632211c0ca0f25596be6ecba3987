The Lagos State Police Command on Monday said it had deployed no fewer than 1,000 of its personnel for a hitch-free Yuletide in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos that it was part of steps aimed at preventing crimes during and after the Yuletide. Elkana said: “The command has made adequate arrangements in the deployment of its   personnel and other resources to markets, recreation centres and places of worship on Christmas Day and New Year Day, to ensure a hitch-free celebration.” He said that the Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, recently declared a state of emergency on traffic with the deployment of no fewer than 1,000 police officers to help ensure a free flow of traffic. He said that Lagos State had two major issues, which were traffic management and crime prevention and control. “Traffic situation is a major concern in the state and once traffic does not flow, we will experience traffic-related crimes such as traffic robbery among others. “Therefore, we have a large number of our personnel in Lagos State working toward managing traffic which will also help prevent crime. “The commissioner has also deployed 200 motorcycles which the command got with the support of the Lagos State Government for traffic patrol alone and also to prevent traffic- related crimes,” he said. Elkana said that the command had also reactivated the Mobile Court System with the support of the Ministry of Justice and the Judiciary. He said that the mobile court had to be reactivated alongside enforcement team for those driving against traffic.
