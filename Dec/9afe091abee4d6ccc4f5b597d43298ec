Chris Oji, Enugu  A mad man whose age was put at about 32 has been reportedly beheaded and his limbs and manhood chopped off by unknown persons at Ugwuawarawa area of Nsukka in Enugu State. Residents of the area woke up to discover the mutilated corpse of the mad man near the Alor Uno – Enugu Ezike – Onuiyi Haven Junction in the area, just few metres away from the university. It was gathered that residents of the area had noticed some machete cuts on the deceased three days earlier before the remains of the man were discovered, an indication that his assailants had attempted to kill and decapitate him. The remains were abandoned near a drainage channel on the roadside before the T- Junction where they were discovered. Eyewitnesses said that the deceased always sat along the axis either scavenging for food or begging for alms, adding that he managed to survive last week’s attack and was still nursing the festering wounds he reportedly sustained due to the deep cuts on his left arm before he was eventually beheaded, probably on Tuesday. Police sources who confirmed the beheading of the unidentified dead mad man pointed out that the old injury was so deep that he always supported the affected arm with his right hand while he moved around in search of food. Enugu Police Command spokesman, Ebere Amaraizu, could not be reached for comments as he was said to be outside the country attending security-related conference. However, shop owners and other business outfits around the scene of the incident closed for business, apparently to avoid being harassed by security agents. It was confirmed that the body of the deceased was evacuated from the scene of crime by homicide detectives from Nsukka Police Division.
