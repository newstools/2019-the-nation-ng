Delay in obtaining entry visas to the U.S. is currently hindering the departure of Nigeria’s male squash team to the World Team Championships which begins in Washington on Sunday. Uchenna Uba, Media Officer of Nigeria Squash Federation (NSF) told NAN on Thursday in Abuja they were, however, still hopeful the visas would be granted soon. He also said four players and a coach would be making the trip for the event. “We are in need of visas for three persons as two people have already acquired theirs long before now. So, we need visas for two players and the coach. “We initially applied for more visas, for some technical officials, but due to the delay we have had to concentrate on securing visa for the two players and the coach alone,’’ Uba added. The federation spokesman, however, disclosed that they have other plans just in case the visas would not be ready. “But we don’t want to reveal it yet,” he said. NAN reports that the players picked to represent Nigeria are Tunde Ajagbe, Sadiq Taiwo, Onos Adegoke and Gabriel Olunmilayo, while Jonah Attah is the coach.
