The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says there is no cause for alarm over the low patronage of the newly introduced free train ride on Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail. Mr. Yakub Mahmood, NRCâ€™s Deputy Director, Public Relations, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Lagos that the low patronage was expected, being a new service. NAN reports that the free train ride from Iju in Lagos to Moniya in Ibadan, which was launched by the Minister of Transport, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, on November 29, started operation on Monday.
