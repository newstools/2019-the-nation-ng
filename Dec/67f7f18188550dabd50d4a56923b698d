 The Federal Government has expressed worry about the country’s abysmal Human Development Index (HDI). It promised to redouble its efforts towards improving the capacity of its workforce to correct the anomaly. Acting Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HOSF), Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, spoke in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, while presenting her keynote paper at the 26th annual conference of heads of training and development in public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy. The conference, organised by the Centre for Management (CMD), had the theme: Management and Human Capital Development in a Growing Economy for Sustainable Result. Mrs Yemi-Esan was represented by the Director, Learning and Development in the Office of Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mr.  Augustine Uzor. She said the 2018 Human Development Indices (HDI), according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) statistical update, showed that Nigeria was far behind other African countries in HDI. “What is most revealing in this report is the fact that in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI, most developing countries of Africa are ahead of Nigeria. They include Botswana, Libya, South Africa and Ghana, which rank 101, 108, 113 and 140 respectively, under the High Development Category,” Yemi-Esan said. The acting HOCSF urged the Centre for Management Development (CMD) to continue in its pivotal role in capacity building and management development across the country. CMD’s Director-General Bitrus Chinoko said the centre would continue to sensitise public and private organisations to only patronise accredited training firms and institutions.
