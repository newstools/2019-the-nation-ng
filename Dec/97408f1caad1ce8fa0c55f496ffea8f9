PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari stirred curiousity at a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on November 22 when he charged the leaders of the party to ensure that it does not die after his tenure. It has now emerged that the Presidentâ€™s statement was not made in a vacuum. It was actually impelled by an appeal the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio had made to the President during a National Executive Council (NEC) meeting a few days earlier. At the said NEC meeting, Akpabio was said to have stood up in his hilarious manner and told President Buhari that there are three major political parties in Nigeria, namely the APC, the PDP and the President himself as a custodian of 12 million votes. Akpabio then pleaded with the President that when his tenure is up, he should not return to Daura with his 12 million votes but ensure that the votes are retained for the survival and progress of APC. There and then, the President pledged his determination to see that APC survives beyond his tenure.
