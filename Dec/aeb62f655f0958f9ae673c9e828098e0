Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) at the weekend rated the Ondo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) the best in the Southwest. The monitoring team said it was satisfied with the way the Ondo SUBEB was utilising Federal Government assistance to transform basic education in the state. Team leader, Ogwueri Osondu, hailed the board for the renovation of a large number of primary schools in the state. Osondu noted that the environment of the schools was more than conducive for teaching and learning, saying Ondo State had set a good template for other states in the country. He urged the board to continue with what he described as the good job it was doing to ensure every child in the state was educated. In his response, SUBEB Chairman, Princess Oladunni Odu, thanked the monitoring team for their commendation. Odu said the massive renovation of schools in the state had significantly increased enrollment in public primary schools. According to her, the board has been able to achieve the feat because of the cooperation it has been receiving from Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who has an uncommon interest in the education of every child.
