NEM Insurance Plc will not merge or acquire any insurance company but stand firm on its own during this recapitalisation, the company’s Group Managing Director, Tope Smart has said. He made this known during the company’s Christmas Carol Concert held at the company’s head office in Lagos. He revealed that the company is comfortable and has already met the new capital requirement of N10 billion for Non-Life business. Smart, who revealed that some companies have approached him for acquisition talks, said the company took the decision to preserve its image. He said the process of acquisition is cumbersome as many do not disclose their real liabilities. He said: “A number of companies have approached us to acquire them. But we have taken a decision not to acquire or merge with anybody because of the kind of experience, we had so far. “One thing I have discover so far is that integrity is very scare in this part of world. People will tell you they have N2 or N3. But by the time you dig deep into their books, you will find huge liabilities. And to preserve the image and value of our company, we have decided not to merge or acquire so that we can be very focused. “We want to do our business the way we understand it. We don’t want distractions or anything that will soil our name and brands that we have labored so much to build.” He said so far, the board, management and staff of the company have been able to explore vision and initiatives.
