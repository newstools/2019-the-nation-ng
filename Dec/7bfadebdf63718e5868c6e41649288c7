The chairman of the Badagry local government, Hon Olusegun Onilude, has commended the governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his commitment to develop the tourism potential of the Badagry Division. He gave this commendation in his welcome address at the Badagry Heritage Festival symposium yesterday at Hunwaji Hotel, Badagry, Lagos. He said: “Words cannot express my joy and appreciation to the Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for his commitment and unprecedented support for the development of tourism potential in the Badagry Division and most especially Badagry Local Government Area.” Onilude noted that for the first time, Governor Sanwo-Olu brought together the various cultures and traditions of various communities comprising the division in order to bring about unity and development. ”This celebration is arguably the first in recent time that our people in the Badagry Division will be coming together to celebrate our cultures and traditions with the intent to foster collective socio-economic development for the region,” he said. The council boss pointed out that the division held a crucial position in the history, arts and cultures of Lagos State that could be nurtured to bring about the desired significant socio-economic growth of “our division as an integral part of the Centre of Excellence. We are naturally endowed with vast waterways, clement weather and other natural endowments that we can build our tourism development on.“
