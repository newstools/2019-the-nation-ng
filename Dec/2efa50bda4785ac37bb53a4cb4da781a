 SUPER Eagles German coach Gernot Rohr has predicted a close contest between Lille OSC striker Victor Osimhen and Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze for the 2019 CAF Youth Player of the Year. Five players including  Achraf Hakimi (Morocco & Borussia Dortmund);  Krépin Diatta (Senegal & Club Brugge);  Moussa Djenepo (Mali & Southampton) and Nigerian duo of Chukwueze  and Osimhen  were named in the final  shortlist ahead of the award gala to be hosted  7th  January 2020 at the Albatros Citadel Sahl Hasheesh, Hurghada in Egypt. But Rohr believes his two Super Eagles’  young guns have done well in the year under review  saying they both  deserved  to be so crowned the best  youngster on the continent. “The two players(Osimhen and Chukwueze) deserve to win the award; they had a great season in Europe, “  stated the former Bayern Munich defender. Incidentally,  Rohr was coy on the chances  of Shanghai Shenhua striker Odion Ighalo  in the  blue ribbon Africa Player of the Year in a strong field that has Liverpool’s duo of Senegalese Sadio Mane and Egyptian Mohamed Salah. “Ighalo has already won  the award of the best scorer(at the2019  AFCON in Egypt)   and will give with pleasure the other one to one of the two big stars (Mane and Salah),” he said. Meanwhile, Rohr has predicted a better 2019  for  the Super Eagles and indeed Nigerian football, adding he was looking forward  to the forthcoming draws for the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup with optimism. “ I hope that the coming year will be better,” noted  66-year-old.  “ For the (World Cup)  draw,  we will have the same  philosophy  like always; all the teams are well prepared and difficult to beat.” The  Africa zone  second round of the preliminary competition for FIFA World Cup 2022 will  take place on 2st 1 January at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Cairo.
