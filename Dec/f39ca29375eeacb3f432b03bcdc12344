Sanni Onogu, Abuja The Senate on Wednesday urged the Nigeria Police to investigate, arrest and prosecute the killers of Professor Jerome Elusiyan of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile Ife. The upper chamber also called on the Federal Government to prioritize security for lives and property of Nigerians during the upcoming festivities. This is even as the Senate observed a minute silence in honour of the late Prof. Elusiyan who according to the Senate, “died in active service to the fatherland”. The resolutions of the Senate followed a motion on a matter of urgent national importance moved by Senator Francis Fadahunsi, on the unfortunate murder of the late Elusiyan by unknown gunmen in Iruekpen,Edo State. Fadahunsi who came under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, said that Prof. Jerome Elusiyan, a professor of Pediatrics and child health; and Chairman, Medical Advisory Council of OAU Teaching Hospital, was attacked and killed on December 13, 2019, at Iruekpen, Esan West Local Government Area, on his way to Benin City, Edo State. The Senator explained that late Prof. Elusiyan left Ile Ife on Thursday for Ambrose Alli University Ekpoma, Edo State to supervise students as an external examiner. He added that on his way back to Benin where he intended to pass the night before moving to Ile-Ife on Saturday, he was attacked and killed by unknown gunmen while his driver sustained gunshot injuries. Fadahunsi said: “The erudite scholar was killed by unknown gunmen while he was in active service of imparting knowledge to the incoming generation may send fears into others who are in similar activities all over the country and other nationals who may be interested in coming to Nigeria now and in future.” He lamented that the police is yet to arrest the killers who perpetrated the dastardly act. In his contribution, Senator Matthew Urhoghide decried the incident saying it was a reflection of the grave security situation in the country.
