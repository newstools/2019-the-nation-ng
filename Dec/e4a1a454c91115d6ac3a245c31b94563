The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Enugu State command made 159 arrests in drug-related offences between January and November this year. Out of the number, 59 were convictions while others are at various stages of prosecution at the Federal High Court. This was disclosed yesterday by the commander, NDLEA Enugu, Adeyemi Adefoye at the Ember-months drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking awareness campaign in Enugu. Adefoye also hinted that within the period the command seized 2.379 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa, 100 kilogrammes of ephedrine, 836 grammes of methamphetamine and 78.93 grammes if cocaine. He said cannabis sativa (hemp) and alcohol had the highest rate of prevalence and their abuse has become so rampant and common in both urban and rural areas. Other drugs like Tramadol, Valium, Richie, rubber solutions and the most recent and deadliest, methamphetamine among others cannot also be ignored, the commander disclosed. Adefoye admonished: “Based on these issues so far outlined, there is the dire need for the various segments of the society to put in their best by coming together constructively and collectively to ensure that we have a drug free society. “There is the need for vigorous campaigns, sensitisation and crusade against drug abuse and illicit trafficking of drugs.”
