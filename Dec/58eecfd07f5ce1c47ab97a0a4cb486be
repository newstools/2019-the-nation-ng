 Prominent Lagos monarch, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi, the Elegushi of Ikate Kingdom, has advised the government and other stakeholders in the education sector to invest more in technical education.
This, the monarch said, is one of the panaceas for addressing unemployment. Oba Elegushi, who addressed reporters at the Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State where he was given an honorary doctoral degree in Public Administration, said there is a huge gap for skilled workers across all strata of the economy. “This is being filled by nationals from neighbouring countries. Unless there is more investment in institutions where the youth can learn the skills, we won’t be making progress in addressing unemployment,” he said. The monarch praised the effort of the Founder and Chancellor of Igbinedion University, Sir Gabriel Igbinedion.
Igbinedion’s vision, he said, charted the course for other private universities. ”It is my first time of entering this university and with what I have seen here, I think it is appropriate that I thank Sir Igbinedion on behalf of the thousands of lives that have been moulded at this citadel and to the many other institutions that have come after you, following your vision, 20 years ago,” he said. The monarch urged the Federal Government and the academic staff unions to resolve their issues amicably in the interest of the students.
