The Police Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Command has said it has increased surveillance of explosives magazines and other materials that could jeopardise internal security. Police Commissioner Maikudi Shehu disclosed this at the command’s fourth quarter conference for senior officers and unit commanders held in Lagos with the theme “strategy reassessment in the fight against internal security threat.” According to him, the major strategy would require improvement in terms of emplacing intelligent innovations and identifying black spots of physical insecurity. “This requires vigilance on our environment, fortification of security at explosives magazines and other stores where they are kept and monitoring the CBRN materials in all bases across the country. “We want to assure citizens that we will continue to keep our game up. We are liaising with other stakeholders to ensure that criminal activities are nipped in the bud.
