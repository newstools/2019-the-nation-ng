A FORMER commissioner for Public Transportation in Lagos State, Chief Lanre Razak, has urged civil servants to redouble their efforts to boost productivity, in order to reciprocate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s approval of N35, 000 as the new minimum wage. Razak, who gave the advice in an interview with reporters in Ikeja, hailed the government for the construction works on some major highways aimed at easing traffic congestion and giving residents relief. Razak, the Balogun General of Epe, noted that the kind gesture by Governor Sanwo-Olu was a further demonstration of the administration’s commitment to workers’ welfare in a bid to making the state’s civil service second to none among the 36 states. He said that public servants owed it a duty to reciprocate the gesture by showing more dedication to duty and rendering qualitative services to Lagosians. Razak said: “Governor Sanwo-Olu, by committing his administration to paying the highest minimum wage to workers, has not only demonstrated his belief that the civil service is the engine room of government’s developmental agenda and growth, but also the primacy of human capital in the successful implementation of THEMES Agenda. ‘’By this development, the governor has sent clear a message that he means well for the workers and Lagosians following the overwhelming mandate freely given to him by the electorate in March and determined to implement people-oriented policies and programmes in line with the All Progressives Congress (APC) manifesto and the Next Level Agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government aimed at making life more meaningful to citizens.
