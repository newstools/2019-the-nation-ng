Our Reporter  AFROjuju music creator Sir Oluwashina Peters aka SSP will be leading top stars to Abidap Hotel, Ipaja, Lagos, as the hotel marks its 35th anniversary next Friday. The event is a three-in-one celebration, which also includes the hotel’s end of year party as well as the 65th birthday of Abidap Hotels’ Managing Director Chief Tony Adenubi. Adenubi said the choice of SSP was borne out of a long relationship with the music star as well as being the first artiste to perform live at Abidap Hotel. He also said Megga 99, Lanre Teriba aka Atorise, Segun Blessing, Wasiu Alabi  Pasuma and other in-house artistes will perform on that day while Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey and King of World beat, Sunny Ade will be guest artistes.  Adenubi, who started in the hotel business with his uncle, the owners of Mayflower Hotel, said hospitality business is in his blood. “I started from barman, to store keeper, supervisor, waiter,” he said. “I have served in all departments of a hotel before becoming the MD of a hotel.” Chief Adenubi who had contact with top musicians and socialites, said his success is due to hard work and perseverance.
