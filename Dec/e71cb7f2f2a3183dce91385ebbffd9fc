THE Nigerian Union of Petroleum and  Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has begun negotiation with Nexen Petroleum Limited in furtherance of its commitment to social dialogue. NUPENG’s General Secretary Comrade Afolabi Olawale,  who made this known to newsmen, stated that NUPENG and Nexen Petroleum had commenced negotiation to address issues earlier raised in its press statement. He praised the readiness of Nexen Petroleum management to adopt global best practices in industrial relations by engaging the union in dialogue over workers’ condition of service. “Our union believes that the dialogue will go a long way in enhancing industrial peace, harmony and high productivity in the workplace”, he said. He noted that the leadership of the NUPENG further warned General Electric/Arco Group Plc not to plunge the country into avoidable industrial crisis during this yuletide period.  Olawale emphasised that General Electric was still very recalcitrant and strongly advised them to urgently do the needful by remitting back to ARCO Group Plc the outstanding over deducted withholding tax to enable Arco pay the severance packages of all workers sacked since 2016. The NUPENG scribe, however, added that the endurance level of the union should not be overstretched and called on all relevant authorities to prevail on General Electric to do the needful in order not to plunge the nation into avoidable industrial crisis.
