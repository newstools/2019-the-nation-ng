The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Akwa Ibom Command, says the command has deployed 1000 personnel to ensure a hitch free Yuletide. Commandant Mr. Adeyinka Ayinla told reporters on Wednesday in an interview in Uyo that the command had mapped out strategies to secure residents’ lives and property. “We have deployed 1000 officers and men during this festive period to tackle criminals. “The aim of the operation is to ensure that the security of lives and property is guaranteed. “The main objective also is to ensure protection of government and private assets and infrastructure, which is our core mandate,” he said. The commandant said the command would collaborate with other security agencies to ensure a hitch free Christmas and New Year celebration. He said the command had deployed personnel in churches to protect worshippers. Ayinla said that the command had identified flashpoints to ensure peace throughout the celebration. He urged residents, worshippers and fun lovers to go about their activities unmolested, stressing that security had been put in place. “We have identified flashpoints and our men will be available at strategic locations to ensure safety of lives and property. “We will collaborate with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) around major roundabout in the city to ensure free flow of traffic throughout this season. “Some of our men will be visible in all malls and recreational centres in the state like Ibeno Beach. Our men have already been stationed there.” Ayinla warned criminals and those wanting to foment trouble to stay away, as security operatives would deal with trouble makers.
