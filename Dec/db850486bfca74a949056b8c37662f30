Residents of Ikare Akoko, particularly those who own shops at ‘Lagos Line’ behind Central Mosque, woke up on Monday morning to the body of a night guard Jimoh Teloye aka ‘Yerepe’ in the area. Teloye, 75, it was learnt, was the night guard engaged by some shop owners around the place over the years. He was reportedly found with his hands tied and cloth in his mouth. It was learnt that burglars broke into the shops with hammers and other weapons. Sympathisers who stormed the scene of the incident, described the late Yerepe, an indigene of Ikare, as a devout Muslim and easygoing man. Ikare Police Area Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Razak Rauf confirmed the incident, saying investigation was on to unravel those behind the act.
