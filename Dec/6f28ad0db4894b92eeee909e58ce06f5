OPERATIVES of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) have conducted a joint operation after previous surveillance at a popular skin care facility in Surulere, Lagos. During the dawn raid, operatives removed different skin care products and chemicals for laboratory analysis and ordered an interim suspension of operation, and use of unapproved products/chemicals and procedures. Babatunde Irukera, the Chief Executive Officer of the FCCPC, in his reaction, said “further investigative actions are ongoing”. Mr. Irukera advised consumers against the use of untested, uncertified and unapproved procedures, which may result in potential adverse effects and permanent injury. A statement signed by the Director General of FCCPC, stated that “Consumers should therefore proceed with an abundance of caution and circumspection when considering skincare and other beauty treatment”.
