The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) has disclosed that billions of naira has been allocated by the government for zonal intervention projects over the past 10 years, but a large amount of that figure cannot be accounted for. The commission said some contractors which were given allocation for these projects have failed to execute the projects while others poorly executed the projects. The Chairman, ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owosanoye, disclosed this at the inauguration and induction of the Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit of the Ministry of Environment in Abuja, stating that other issues brought to light by these initiatives include diversion, embezzlement of government funds. Others are: irregular payments, abuse of due process, budget padding, series of unethical behaviour in the workplace to mention but few. He added that, “The commission also made recoveries of public funds amounting to over N9 billion  from capital funds and N25.7 billion from personnel cost. “Diverted government assets have been recovered and erring contractors are forced to return to project sites and ensure completion of abandoned projects or are prosecuted accordingly. “The Ministry of Environment has a mission of being proactive in ensuring environmental protection and promoting sustainability.” The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Mrs. Ibukun Odusote said, corruption in various forms has eaten deep into the fabrics of the Civil Service and the nation at large. It is responsible for slow pace of development in the public service. This milestone achievement will enable the ministry contribute its own quota to the success of fight against corruption.
