African Alliance has recorded a 68 per cent premium income growth from N3 billion at the end of third quarter 2018 to N5.12 billion at the end of third quarter 2019, the Managing Director, Funmi Omo, has said. She made this known at a press conference held at the company’s headquarters in Lagos. She stated that the company also paid claims of about N6 billion to keep up with its promises of maintaining customer amazement. On the company’s recapitalisation plans, she said the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has given a ‘No Objection’ to our plans which means we are on course. She said the company has also continued to defy the odds with a string of impressive performances that have seen the 59-year-old insurer stabilise its business and earn positive reviews from industry watchers. While listing the giant strides the firm has made in less than two years, she restated the management’s commitment to sustaining the upward growth trajectory across all metrics. She said: “Ours is a business that has seen it all and survived it all. Our position in just two years compared to now is testament to the unstinting leadership and guidance of our Board, the relentless drive of the executive management and a most committed and flexible staff who never shies away from challenges in any form. “In line with our commitment to build a formidable workforce and grow the overall brand image, the company made key appointments into its management cadre. Akinola Akinwole was appointed as Head, Human Capital and Bankole Banjo as Brand, Media and Communications Manager. Between Akinola and Bankole, we have two of the brightest minds in their fields.
