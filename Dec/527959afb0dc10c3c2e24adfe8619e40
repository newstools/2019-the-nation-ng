 NIGERIAN equities suffered a major contraction last week as sustained decline in share prices shaved off N154 billion from the market capitalisation. With more than two decliners to every gainer, the stock market traded mostly on the negative side throughout the week. Average decline for the five-day trading session stood at 1.19 per cent at the weekend, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N154 billion. The decline depressed the average year-to-date return to -15.57 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)-the common index that tracks share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) declined from its week’s opening index of 26,855.52 points to close the week at 26,536.21 points.

On the positive side, the NSE Insurance Index and the NSE Oil and Gas Index inched up by 0.03 per cent each.
