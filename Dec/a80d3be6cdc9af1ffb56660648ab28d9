Wearing the shoes of one’s father is not always easy but Gen. Buba Marwa’s son, Muhamed, has done this effortlessly. In his days, the former Borno and Lagos State military administrator was a fantastic soldier. While he has taken a back seat, his son has ensured that his father’s legacy lives on. Recently, for his effort, Muhamed was among officers who were promoted by the Nigerian Army. He was elevated to the rank of Lt. Colonel. Currently studying for a PhD at the University of Buckingham, he was decorated with his new rank at the Nigerian High Commission in London early this week. And the excited dad witnessed the decoration ceremony carried out under the supervision of Nigeria’s High Commissioner, Ambassador George Oguntade.
