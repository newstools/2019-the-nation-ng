THE Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) yesterday arrested 25 motorists for driving against traffic in Mile 2 and Cele areas of Lagos. Its General Manager, Mr Olajide Oduyoye, said driving against traffic endangers lives. “Disobeying traffic law is unacceptable and we, as a responsible agency for enforcement, are doing our best to make sure that the governor’s mandate is met. “That is why we have gone out to arrest these vehicles taking ‘one way’, thereby violating the law and endangering lives. “The governor has said enough is enough. Things have to change and that is why you all see all the efforts being made by LASTMA.”
