 Nigerians have been advised to embrace love, care and sacrifice to enjoy the best of God in 2020. Stake President of the Lagos Nigeria Ikeja Stake of Zion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Lagos, Moses John Ekpah, gave the advice last week at the 2019 annual inter- denominational Christmas concert. He said: “This season is passing across an important message of love, loving God and obey Him, caring for each other, with these the trouble of this Nation will be taken care off. “Jesus Christ has been born and has given us the idea to sacrifice for one another by dying for us and our leaders should serve with the fear of the Lord,” Ekpah said. The concert was marked by children presentation, choir ministration, drama presentation, comedy and ballerina dance. The Nativity drama ministry also presented a drama about how Baby Jesus was given birth to. President of the church Peter Oyedeji advised Nigerians to emulate Christ. “This season is not just for merriment alone but a season to help the needy and love the less privilege. “This season is not about wearing new things but about showing Love to the Lord by helping those who need our help in one way or the other,” Oyedeji said.
