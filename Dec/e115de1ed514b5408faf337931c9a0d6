 MANY banks in Akoko area of Ondo State on Wednesday closed their premises. The closure was not limited to Ikare-Akoko, as those in Ogbagi, Irun Akungba and Oka-Akoko also shut their premises. Some customers, who came from neighbouring towns and villages to transact business at Ikare-Akoko, lamented over the closure. Two of them, Michael Bello, who came from Akunu-Akoko and Chief Ojo Ariya from Erusu-Akoko appealed to security agents to tighten security, especially with the approach of Christmas. A banker, who spoke in confidence, said that there were signals and security alerts that robbers were planning to attack banks in the area, hence the decision to close business to monitor the situation. Police patrolled the major streets in Ikare-Akoko, while surveillance was placed around the banks. The Area Police Commander for Ikare-Akoko, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Razak Rauf, confirmed the incident. He said his men would protect lives and property.
