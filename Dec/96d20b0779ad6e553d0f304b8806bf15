Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has advised stakeholders and taxpayers to embrace its Enterprise Tax Administration System, a digital, end-to-end, multi-channel solution for tax filing and payments. It explained that this was necessary to help government generate revenue and achieve a seamless and compliant tax system. According to a statement, LIRS made this call at a workshop where key stakeholders, consisting of consultants, account and tax experts, large business organisations’ representatives, and small and medium-scale enterprises, came together to share insights with the public. The LIRS said this was part of its strategy of making the public know more about and take advantage of the newly introduced electronic tax system. The statement said, “The system has capabilities for tax registration, tax calculation, filing of returns, payment and processing of treasury receipts. The challenge of revenue generation is not new in Nigeria. “It is one that is faced both at the federal level with its over dependence on proceeds from the volatile crude oil market and sub-optimal tax administration.
