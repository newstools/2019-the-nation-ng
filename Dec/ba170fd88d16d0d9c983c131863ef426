 Commissioner for Environment in Kano State, Dr Kabir Getso, has urged the residents to comply with the monthly environmental sanitation in the state in spite of the festivities. Getso made the call in a statement by the ministry’s Public Relations Officer,  Malam Bashir Habib, in Kano on Friday. He also warned commercial tricycle operators to desist from their nonchalant attitude of not partaking in the exercise. According to him, the environmental sanitation is for people to have healthy and hygienic environment. He added that the purpose of the exercise was for people to understand the importance of environmental hygiene and cleanliness without being forced to clean. NAN reports that since inception, the Ganduje administration has introduced the monthly environmental sanitation slated for the last Friday and Saturday of every month. While the Friday sanitation targeted workplaces, motor parks and markets, the Saturday exercise concentrated on homes and environs.
