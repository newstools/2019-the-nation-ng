 The Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) has met with powdered milk manufacturers and market executives in the state with planned efforts to guarantee the safety and protection of consumers from hazardous products in unhealthy handling and sales of the product. The follow-up meeting, which took place at the LASCOPA office, had in attendance representatives of various powdered milk manufacturing companies such as Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Arla Foods, Fareast Mercantile as well as Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria Limited and the representatives of the executive members of some markets in the state, including Chief (Mrs.) Cynthia Aguize of the Ile-Epo Market. Speaking to participants during the parley, the General Manager of LASCOPA, Kemi Olugbode said the meeting became necessary to proffer better ways to address the handling and sales of powdered milk which is currently sold in sacks in the open market like other commodities. “Powdered milk cannot be exposed, it can only be sold in packaged form, particularly because milk cannot be exposed to air,” Olugbode said. The General Manager said that there had been a consensus that the present method of display, handling and sales of powdered milk in the open market makes it unwholesome and unsafe for consumption and therefore should be stopped. She promised that LASCOPA would organise seminars to educate traders on the best ways to handle and sell the product to prevent contamination. The manufacturers were also advised to provide smaller packages of their products instead of the usual 25kg size, particularly because of small entrepreneurs, emphasising that the package should have an inscription. He however added that the milk is only for industrial use.
