By Sam Ibok  No fewer than 32 new medical doctors have taken the physician oath at the University of Calabar (UNICAL) College of Medical Sciences. The ceremony,  which was  the  51st held at the UNICAL International Conference Centre, with eminent personalities, parents and guardians in attendance. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Zana Akpagu, praised parents for providing the required resources and support that sustained the graduands throughout their stay in the university. Akpagu congratulated the new medical doctors for conquering the difficult moments, which he said they faced before graduation. He advised them to see hard work as a virtue, adding that the sky would be their starting point if they could stick to the guidelines of the profession. Provost of the college, Prof Victor Ansa, congratulated them on their successful completion of the programme, saying it has been a long journey filled with anxiety and fears.  “You have all successfully completed the first phase of training as medical doctors,” he said, admonishing them not to betray the confidence reposed in them by involving themselves in unethical practices that would portray the institution in bad light. Ansa described the new doctors as the harvest of the college, which they are sending to the society. He urged them to work hard to maintain the standard of their alma mater and to always be good ambassadors. Administering the oath on the physicians, the Registrar, Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), Dr. Tajudeen Sanusi, noted that the oath-taking ritual placed a moral burden on the graduates to live above board. Speaking on behalf of the graduands, Dr. Udofia Godswill, who is also the class representative, praised the school management for providing a conducive learning environment. He also acknowledged the support and care of their parents, lecturers and workers in the department.
