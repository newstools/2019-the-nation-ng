The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has urged  motorists to always remember those depending on them and other road users while driving. Its Ikorodu Unit Commander, Olawale Kareem, made the plea at the ‘Drive to Stay Alive’ campaign held in Majekodunmi Motor Park, Sabo in Ikorodu to remind road users of traffic rules in order to prevent accidents during the Yuletide. He said the majority of drivers drive recklessly under the influence of drugs, adding that these people should always be thinking of their wives, children and others depending on them for living. He said anyone caught with driving recklessly during the Yuletide would be prosecuted in accordance with traffic laws. He said the Unit Command had recorded no fewer than 36 auto crashes from January to November, 2019, involving 57 motors and nine motorcycles within the corridor, adding that of 339 persons involved, seven died, 92 sustained injuries, while 240 were rescued without injuries. He said Ikorodu had been categorised as one of the busiest transport hubs in Lagos. He said the command had deployed both regular and special marshals to major corridors to ensure the prompt removal of broken-down vehicles and prevent traffic gridlock during the festive period. His counterpart in Ibeju-Kekki, Assistant Corps Commander Idris Popoola, said the Unit Command recorded 18 road crashes between January and November. He said of 75 people involved, 27 were injured, two died, while others were rescued without injuries. The unit commanders appealed to motorists to always imbibe good attitude and shun indiscipline that would hinder their safety. They said road safety is a shared responsibility and urged drivers to keep away from dangerous overtaking, overloading, lane indiscipline, drunk driving, overspeeding and all forms of distractions such as the use of phones while driving.
