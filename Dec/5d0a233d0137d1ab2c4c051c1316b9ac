COLLINS NWEZE  Ecobank Nigeria has partnered the Lagos State Ministry of Environment on Waterfront Clean Up Programme. The partnership is to enhance the preservation of marine ecosystem and effectively facilitate socio-economic activities, such as transportation, power generation, irrigation and habitat for aquatic life. The exercise, tagged: Cleaner Waterfront Our Pride,  was flagged off at the Lagos State Government Ferry Jetty, Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos. Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State  on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, said the project was  dedicated to cleaning Lagos waterfronts and educating people on ways of disposing plastic waste properly rather than dumping them into the gutter and how to preserve the ecosystem in general. He praised Ecobank for its continual support on  environmental sustainability issues, noting that each and every citizen and corporate bodies are stakeholders and must be involved in helping to preserve the environment, as it is a call to action for all.  Also speaking, the Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan, said the partnership to clear up Lagos waterfronts is  part of the Pan African bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy to support environmental sustainability initiatives with a view to making the environment safer for living. According to him, the partnership with Lagos State government and other non- governmental organisations across the continent was in that direction. He noted that the water bodies are priceless gifts of nature with huge aesthetic, tourism and economic values. He lamented that these however had been subjected to all forms of abuse and degradation, including dumping and littering with solid wastes and all forms of debris. The Managing Director who was represented by Tunde Dawodu, a General Manager, said there should be a culture change on the way we dispose of our garbage. This, he noted starts with every one of us.
