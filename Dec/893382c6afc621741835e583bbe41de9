 Nigerian legend Richard Owubokiri has entered the race to become the next president of his former club Brazilian club Esporte Clube Vitória. Elections are due in 2021 but Owubokiri yesterday informed NationSport that consultations have begun in earnest, adding he was encouraged with the massive support from the club’s faithful. Owubokiri starred for Nigeria in his heyday and was in the generation of the Super Eagles that qualified the country for her maiden appearance at the USA’94 World Cup. He has a larger than life image in his adopted home in Salvador of Bahia where he doubles as a players’ agent and real estate entrepreneur but he now wants to turn his attention to football administration. “I’ll be contesting in the presidential election for my former club here in Salvador,” the former Sharks of Port Harcourt told NationSport. Elections (into a new board)  are coming up in about two and half years’  time but I’m preparing myself  ahead; opinion polls almost every day are showing that I’m equal to the task of becoming the next president of the club. “By the grace of God, I’m convinced that I’ll unseat the present president (Paulo Carneiro) in coming elections. I will unseat him.” Owubokiri who was recently sworn in as an Ambassador for world’s peace by United Nations, said  he was proud of his growing profile. “I’m delighted to be chosen as an Ambassador for Peace; it’s one of the highest thing any human can achieve and in my capacity, I want to promote peace anywhere that is conflict,” he said. He is regarded as one of the greatest players to have don the club jersey of Salvador-based side where he enjoyed two spells  in the 1980s (1984 to 1986) as well as 1994 after a tour of European clubs including Laval, Metz, Benfica, Estrela Amadora and Boavista.
