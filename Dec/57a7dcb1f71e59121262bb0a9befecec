 Hon. Rasheed Makinde, of the Lagos State House of Assembly has urged the government to vote more funds to Ministries and agencies taking care of the needy and widows in the society, so as to reduce the wide gap of inequality. Makinde, who represents Ifako Ijaiye II Constituency, gave the charge at the Annual Feed the Widow event, organised by the Widows Care and Charity Organisation (WICCO). He noted that widows were vulnerable and, therefore, need all the support they could garner. “My advice to them is to keep their chastity, believing that whatever trauma they are going through is for a short while, they should be steadfast in whatever they do. “Overtime, it will pay off; they will eat the fruit of their labour through their wards and take proper care of their children in order to have a secured future, it could be better imagined when the burden of two people rest on one person. He, however, called for better funding for government agencies catering for the welfare of the needy.
