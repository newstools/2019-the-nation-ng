The General Manager of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, LASEPA, Dr Dolapo Fasawe on Wednesday said the agency has reopened 26 out of the 28 facilities shut due to non-compliance of environmental laws in the state. Dr Fasawe said the affected facilities had now complied with the environmental laws guiding their operations, while warning Lagos citizens to be cautious in their celebration so as not to disturb the peace of their neighbours during the festive season. The warning, she said, became necessary considering the rate of reports of infractions received by the agency in recent time. “There are several complaints of abuses against the environment and infringement on individuals’ rights to the peaceful ambiance as a result of persistent noise pollution in the environment,” she said. Warning further that any Event Centre, hospitality (hotels, Bars, Lounges) and religious Centre that operate and generating noise without obtaining noise permits, would attract fines, sealing, and prosecution. The LASEPA boss, therefore, expressed satisfaction with some of the facilities earlier sealed by the agency for meeting the conditions stipulated for their re-opening and also revealed that 26 out of the 28 sealed facilities had been reopened, while two were advised to relocate from their area of operation. She said: “In addition to the unsealing of 26 facilities out of the 28 earlier sealed by officials of our agency, the remaining two facilities were ordered to relocate from their present locations to a more suitable place for their activities.
