 ARCHBISHOP Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Archbishop Alfred Adewale Martins has stressed the need for Nigerians to ensure a clean and healthy environment. Archbishop Martins, who spoke at the weekend during the inauguration of Network of Young Catholic Careers for the Environment in Nigeria (NYCCEN), said the initiative was established for the sake of doing something proactive for the wellbeing of the environment. “This initiative would combine with efforts being made across the world to ensure the conservation of the environment and a move against the degradation of the world. “To preserve our environment, we must ensure planting of trees, cutting down on the use of plastic containers and ensure their proper disposal. We must clear non bio-degradable materials from our waste; learn the culture of recycling and encourage productive initiatives which results from recycling, that support the use of solar energy and seeks alternate sources of energy, among others.” Martins emphasised the need for the preservation of the physical environment despite the many challenges currently facing the country, including that we are; “In a country where we have just witnessed legitimacy awarded to elections that by credible accounts, were not free and fair, such that our democracy leans on a precipice; a country whereby some rushed up laws, N40billion is made available for serving senators and ministers, while at the same time, salaries of ordinary Nigerians remain unpaid and the workers minimum wage of N30,000 is yet  to be implemented, among others.”
