The Enugu State Internal Revenue Service (ESIRS) has attributed the sustainable increase in the state’s Internally Generated Revenues (IGR) to the well-thought-out measures adopted by the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration. Speaking during the Taxpayers’ Sensitization and Enlightenment Programme organized by the Enugu State Internal Revenue Service (ESIRS) in conjunction with the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, held at Enugu, the Chairman of ESIRS, Prince Emeka Odo, disclosed that the state government “has been implementing a cocktail of measures designed to make tax payment easier for tax payers in the state”. The chairman stated that the event, which also witnessed the investiture of the State Accountant-General, Sir.  Paschal Okolie, as Chairman, Enugu and District Society, Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, was to deepen the relationship between the tax authority and tax payers. Odo noted that Ugwuanyi’s administration has been implementing “an ambitious four-point development agenda” aimed at impacting positively on the lives of the people, stressing that such feat requires that government harnesses all the potential sources of internally generated revenues in the state without additional pressure on the people. The chairman added that it was in the light of the above that the agency in conjunction with other related agencies of government embarked on the programme for effective result.
