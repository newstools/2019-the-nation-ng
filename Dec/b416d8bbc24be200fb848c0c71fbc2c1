 THE Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Rivers State Command, Muktar Lawal, has said 306 suspected vandals and oil thieves were arrested in Rivers State by the command in the outgoing year. He said 31 trucks and 15 vehicles loaded with stolen petroleum products, two tug boats, two barges and one vessel conveying adulterated petroleum products were impounded. Lawal, who addressed reporters yesterday in Port Harcourt, said that the command remained focused on the mandate of the corps, despite strong wind of challenges posed by militants, vandals, miscreants and oil thieves. He said: “Without fear of any doubt, I wish to say that the NSCDC is living up to expectations regarding checkmating the activities of economic saboteurs who vandalise the critical national assets and infrastructure of this nation. “We have remained focused in enlightening, encouraging and updating the public on the roles of the corps, in relation to private guards, companies’ operators and our passionate role in disaster management. “The command’s readiness to protect critical national assets and infrastructure is non-negotiable. This has yielded positive results, as cases of vandalism of the critical national assets and infrastructure are gradually reducing. “The impact of the corps in the state has opened more operational doors for the corps to perform its statutory mandate within and around Rivers State. “Agro Allied Rangers (AAR) team was statutorily assigned and inaugurated in NSCDC to provide security to those sectors that are responsible for using cultural resources to produce consumer goods. With the coming of AAR team, you hardly hear of herdsmen and farmers clash in Rivers State, this is as a result of the rigorous enlightenment campaigns embarked on by the corps among the herdsmen and host communities on the need for peaceful coexistence.”
