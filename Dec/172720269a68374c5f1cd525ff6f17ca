 As Lagos State government graduates 4,000 students from 17 skill acquisition centres, civil servants who are about to be retired have been enjoined by Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to acquire skills in order to become employers of labour. While congratulating the graduands, the governor urged them to make the best use of the opportunity given to them. “What you have in your hands is a golden opportunity that must not be wasted. Endeavour to continue to build on what you have been taught at the various centres; never get tired of learning,” said Sanwo-Olu who was represented by his wife, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu. According to the governor, acquiring skills and making a livelihood out of them is the only solution to the massive unemployment that Nigeria is experiencing today. “I therefore enjoin youths to take advantage of the skills acquisition programme at the 17 skill acquisition centres in all the five divisions in Lagos State. There is obviously a dearth of white collar jobs. In order to stamp out poverty and unemployment, everyone must learn and acquire skills that will enable them to be independent and self reliant,” Sanwo-Olu said. Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Hon. Cecila Bolaji Dada, stated that the graduands were made up of majorly women, young school leavers, unemployed graduates from tertiary institutions and will be receiving the Lagos State Technical and Vocational Education Board (LASTVEB) certificate, which grants them a seamless transition into any of the Lagos State technical colleges of their choice for further training. “It is expected that the graduands will grow to become self employed, employers of labour or even employees in organizations; by so doing they can cater for themselves and their families,”declared Dada. Awards and startup machines were given to best graduating students in the various skills, while certificates were given to all graduands.
