First Chairman, Indigenous Manufacturers of Footwear Association, Trade Fair Market Complex, Chijioke Obiora, has said that his administration will do everything in its power to create industries that will start manufacturing shoes in Nigeria. He spoke during the swearing-in and inauguration of his executives at the Trade Fair market in Lagos. “There is a huge deficit in footwear production in Nigeria and we are longing to set up industries that will be manufacturing shoes here for a bigger supply because Nigeria depends so much on Chinese but we want to create a market where both local made and imported will strive.” The chairman who said the creation of shoe industries will provide employment noted that “about 92 percent of the footwear dealers are youths and we want to use this opportunity to empower them to become local manufacturers in the country so that they can be proud of being a shoe maker or seller.
