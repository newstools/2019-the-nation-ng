FIFA has slammed the English Premier League for not enforcing a three step procedure to racism at football matches. FIFA Secretary General, Fatma Samoura, in a July letter to every national association has created confusion as English football reels from another marquee game being tarnished by racism. Tottenham has asked the Premier League to clarify the procedures it follows in the wake of the fallout from Chelsea defender Antonio Rüdiger reporting being subjected to monkey noises from the home fans in Sunday’s London derby. Rudiger’s complaint was swiftly followed by a warning announcement to more than 61,000 fans in the Tottenham Stadium. “Racist behavior among spectators is interfering with the game,” the announcer stated. By ordering the announcement, referee Anthony Taylor was clearly following the first step of the FIFA and UEFA anti-racism protocol, which then allows the suspension of the game and eventual abandonment if abuse continues. But the Premier League has a more involved six-step reaction plan that does not provide the clarity offered by the instructions provided by FIFA and European body UEFA for referees to follow. The priority for the Premier League is ensuring “the match is not unduly interrupted,” which leads to the league not demanding referees seek an in-stadium warning to fans to cease the racism.
