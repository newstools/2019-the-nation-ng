By Oluwatobi Odeyinka  Students of the University of Ibadan (UI) last Saturday elected new executives into the Students’ Union (SU) using electronic voting method. This is the first election after the university’s Senate suspended SU activities indefinitely on May 30, 2017 following a protest by students over delay in the issuance of digitised identity cards. The Senate lifted the ban on August 30, 2019 and called for election. A committee of all faculty presidents was empowered to conduct the election.  The committee declared that the election would be in form of electronic voting, as against the ballot voting that used to be.  The election which was supposed to hold between 8am and 4pm was extended till 9pm due to breakdown in the voting site for about two hours. The post of the President was contested by Akeju Oluwasegun from the Faculty of Law and Olofinlade Ebenezer from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Akeju was declared winner after pulling 2,753 votes while Olofinlade got 2,138.
