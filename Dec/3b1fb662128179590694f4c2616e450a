Chicken is one of the most popular livestock all over the world. During festive seasons, chicken serves as a life-saver to many people. There are many varieties of chicken including free-range chicken, organic chicken, and conventional chicken, and the differences between them relate to how they are fed and raised. Below are some of the nutritional benefits of chicken to human health as found in organic facts: Lower cholesterol The amount of saturated fat and cholesterol found in red meat such as beef, pork, and lamb are much higher than the levels found in chicken, fish, and vegetables. Therefore, the American Heart Association, AHA, has advised consuming chicken or fish instead of red meat for a lowered risk of cholesterol and subsequent heart disease development. The AHA also says that consuming chicken or fish must be limited to normal levels, as excessive consumption can also lead to the development of heart disease. Weight loss Diets with high levels of protein are effective in reducing weight and chicken falls in this category as part of a high protein diet for weight loss. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition shows that weight loss and improvements in the total lipid profile can be achieved in people who regularly ate chicken breast. This weight loss capability is due to the high level of protein and fewer calories. Anticancer properties According to some studies, it has been found that in non-vegetarians, higher consumption of red meat, pork, and ham increased the risk of colorectal cancer, while in chicken and fish eaters, the risk of developing this cancer in later life was reduced, although the evidence is not conclusive. Reduction in the consumption of red meat is associated with lowering the risk of colon cancer. You can incorporate chicken in your meal, however, just like all foods, it must not be in excess.
