Thirteen teams will battle for honours at the 2019 edition of the Leg Lagos Challenge billed to kick off on 4th of December at the Agege Stadium, Lagos. The five-day scouting tournament organised by Donbalon Sports Commerz will feature grassroots football teams drawn from different parts of the state. According to the organisers, six FIFA licensing agents will be coming from USA and Europe to scout for players during the tournament. Technical Director, Taiwo Oloyede, charged the players to be disciplined. “We thank the organisers for this initiative to promote talents. We have so many footballers that are talented but looking for opportunities like this to exhibit what God has given them”. “I implore most of the teams to comply with the rules and regulations covering the game. Discipline should be their watch word of the players and their coaches. I believe if they are disciplined, the sky will be their limit,” Oloyede said.
