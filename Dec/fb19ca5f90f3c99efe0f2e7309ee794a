 Golden  Eaglets’ two-time FIFA World Cup-winning coach Manu Garba has received kudos  for his meritorious work with Nigerian youngsters  over the years. Regarded as one of the best youth coaches ever  with a string of awards and trophies, the 53-year-old  Garba  was rewarded yet again Saturday night  with  excellence award by a Non-Governmental Organisation, Arewarmu Duniyarmu Association of Nigeria   in recognition of his ‘ contribution  towards the growth and  development  of the game’ especially under his watch as coach of the Golden Eaglets. “It was an amazing ceremony with people like Gombe State Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, His Royal Highness the Emir of Gombe Abubakar Shehu-Abubakar, Secretary to the Federal Government Boss Mustapha, Chief of  Army Staff Search Tukur  Buratai  also getting awards and I’m really happy  to be so recognised ,” explained  Garba who will be 54 on December 31st. “ The award is actually  from a Non- Governmental organization involving all the 19  Northern States of Nigeria  and I’m  happy that people still appreciate all what I have been doing over the years.” Few Nigerian coaches can match Garba’s rich collection of medals  including double  Gold medal  as FIFA U-17 World Cup winner  at Korea 2007 and UAE 2013.He was  also Gold medal winner at the 2001 Umbro International Football Championship in Manchester as well as the Gold  medal of the 2015 AFCON  U20 held in Senegal. This year, Garba’s Golden Eaglets stumbled at the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup in Brazil when they were beaten 3-1 by The Netherlands  in the Round of 16. But the double (OON and OFR)  National Honour awardee said he was not perturbed amidst speculations that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) might not renew his contract as  head coach of the national U-17 side. “God Almighty is in charge of where I will be,” Garba retreated  in his usual philosophical hue.“ I think it’s only Allah that will know where I will be.”
