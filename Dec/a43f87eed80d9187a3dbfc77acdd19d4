 LAGOS monarch, the Elegushi of Ikate Kingdom, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi has enjoined all interested parties to the vacant stool of the Oniru of Iru-Victoria Island, to allow the selection process run its full course and support whoever emerges. The stool became vacant when Oba Idowu Oniru joined his ancestors this year. In a statement issued in Lagos by the Special Assistant on Public Affairs to the monarch, Oba Saheed said there were eminently qualified Princes from all the ruling houses qualified to occupy the stool and possess the pedigree and tutelage to become King – Elegushi has no doubt that a worthy successor would emerge from the process, to take over from late Oba Idowu Oniru. While reacting to rumours of the monarch’s preference for a particular candidate, the Elegushi stated that he has no preference for any of the contenders, stating that the front-runners are his personal friends, whom he shares many special moments with and are all qualified to occupy the vacant stool. “I have no preference for any of the contenders to the throne. The major contenders are my personal friends. I have known them for many years and we have shared so many special moments together.  I will support whoever emerges as the Oniru. There is a selection process and this is being followed, we all should wait for the outcome of this process”. “I am shocked to read such statements in the media. This is a private family affair of the Onirus and I am sure they are capable of handling this. I am not a member of the family; I am the Elegushi of the Ikate and my powers do not include installing a king for another kingdom”. The monarch enjoined the media to report events leading up to the selection accurately, without creating rancour in Iru land and amongst the contending parties, advising them to allow the laid down rules of selecting a monarch be followed in this instance.
