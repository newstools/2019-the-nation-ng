By Victor Akande  IT was a groovy time at the Smirnoff neon-themed party which held penultimate Friday at Da Civic Centre, Oka, Benin City, Edo State. Present to thrill the audience were the likes of Mayorkun, DJ Spinall, Dice Alies, Erigga and Fireboy. DJ set the tone for the party. And kicking off the performances was Internet boy wonder, Sydney Talker, who dazzled the crowd with his unique style of street dance.  Afterwards, 15 amateur dancers competed to win a grand prize of N300,000. After performances by Erigga, Dice Ailes and Fireboy, Mayorkun rounded up the night with chart smashing hits. All through, mixologists fuelled the party with Smirnoff cocktails.
