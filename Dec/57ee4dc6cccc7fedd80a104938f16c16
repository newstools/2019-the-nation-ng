He said Mogbo Afan, his classmate, who brought the object to the school ran away immediately it exploded. “This incident happened around 9:am. One of my classmates, Mogbo brought an object that looked like electric bulb which had black cover. He removed the cover and I was inside the classroom while he was on the steps very close to our classroom. When he removed the cover of the object, the object fell from his hand and dropped on the floor. “I rushed to pick it up and throw it away thinking that it was an ordinary knockout so that it doesn’t scare us in the class. Immediately it exploded in my hand and chopped it off like this. I also sustained  leg injuries.
