Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday dismissed the suit filed by the Police Service Commission (PSC) challenging the recruitment of 10,000 constables into the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) by the Inspector General of Police (IGP). The PSC had sued the NPF, the IGP and the Minister of Police Affairs as first, second and third respondents over the matter. The Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister was subsequently added as a fourth respondent. The PSC sought to restrain the defendants, their officers and representatives, including anybody or person acting on their behalf from appointing, recruiting or attempting to appoint or recruit by any means whatsoever any person into any office in the first defendant, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. Delivering judgment, Justice Ekwo held that after examining the evidences, he found nothing to establish the plaintiffâ€™s case, which he described as lacking in merit. The judge held that the power of recruitment of constables into the NPF is under the IGP, who controls the process.
