 Rangers International FC will be hoping for redemption in the CAF Confederation Cup when it takes on FC Nouadhibou in Nouakchott, Mauritania on Sunday. The encounter is a match day three fixture in group A of the second tier continental club competition and Coach Salisu Yusuf’s men need to bounce back to winning ways after going seven matches without a win in both domestic and continental games. The Flying Antelopes though with a lot of injury worries to key players still have a large pool of reserves to pick from for this battle against the reigning league champions of Mauritania. With the safe arrival of the 26-man delegation in Nouakchott early yesterday, the team settled down nicely and looked with optimism to the game tomorrow. Attacking sensation, Kingsley Eleje, who just returned from an injury lay-off, is dreaming a win over their opponent who like Rangers is yet to hit the ground running in the group stage of the competition, registering two losses apiece to Egyptian opponents. “The game against Nouaghibou is really going to be tough considering the fact that they have lost two games in a row and they want to win at all cost but the fact remains that we are a good team that can win anytime and anywhere even though we are battling to win games presently. I believe we have the qualities to come out victorious at the end,” stated the power playing forward. On the position of the team in the group stage of the competition, Eleje said, “It is still very possible for us to qualify for the quarter-final despite losing our last two games. We can also win away to get back on track. It is not the end until the last day of the group games. Rangers is a team with so much qualities. Every player in the team is ready.” No doubt, Coach Salisu would have loved a full squad to choose from but he would miss the services of Ifeanyi George, Pape Ousmane Sane, Ajani Ibrahim, Godspower Aniefiok, Semiu Liadi, Akpos Adubi and a few more in this important encounter.
