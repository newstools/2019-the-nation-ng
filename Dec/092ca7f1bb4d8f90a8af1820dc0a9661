British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) top pundit John Bennett hailed Nigeria International Kelechi Iheanacho, saying the Leicester City striker is gradually returning to his Manchester City days. Iheanacho opened the scoring for the Foxes in their 2-1 away win at West Ham on Saturday and the 23 year-old has been directly involved in five goals so far in the league this season, three goals and two assists in just 180 minutes on the pitch so far. The 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup Golden Ball winner scored 12 goals in 46 games in two seasons for Manchester City before leaving for Leicester in 2017. Bennett tweeted: “Kelechi Iheanacho is back to being that natural finisher he was in his Manchester City days.” Meanwhile, Leicester’s coach Brendan Rodgers was delighted by his side’s mentality in the win over West Ham United win at London Stadium. Rodgers elected to make nine changes to his starting line-up for a second clash in less than 48 hours following a considerable build-up of fixtures over the festive season. “It’s a really good feeling,” the Northern Irishman told LCFC TV. We’ve been used to winning. The last couple of games have been really tough for us. “We played against two super teams at the very top of the world game, so that’s not really our measure at this stage. “I said to the players beforehand that in this sport, at the top level, you’ve got to be at your maximum. They showed that mentality. “You’ve got to have that edge and I thought we had that today in terms of our energy and attitude in the game, considering so many of the players that we brought into the squad. “So, I’m so happy for them. They get a great reward. It’s been hard for them, especially after the last defeat to Liverpool, but they came here and played very, very well.”
