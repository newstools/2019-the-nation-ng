Princess Ronke Ademiluyi, Founder and Chief Executive of Africa Fashion Week London/Nigeria has described black women as the most beautiful in the world. Ademiluyi told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at a two-day event on the 2019 Africa Fashion Week held in Lagos. According to her, this has been proven in the recent evolution of having five of the biggest beauty pageant titles won by black women. She said that the pride of blacks, which started in 2001 with Nigeria’s Agbani Darego, recently manifested when Miss Jamaica, Toni-Ann Singh won the 2019 Miss World beauty pageant in London. “Black is real beauty, not only facially, but physically and that is why renowned designers excel using blacks as models to market their creations. “Black Women are the most beautiful women in the world that can take African fashion to the next level,” she added. Speaking on the Africa Fashion Week, Nigeria, Ademiluyi said that African designs could compete favourably internationally. “Our designs are amazing. African designers have truly evolved. In fact, they can match any western designer out there. “Our collections are unique and stand out globally. Even during our fashion shows in London, our designs and collections were widely accepted and we’re in demand,” she said. NAN reports that 90 designers and exhibitors featured in the show alongside 61 models on the catwalk. Ademiluyi, who is also the cultural ambassador to Queen Moremi Ajasoro, told NAN that the grand finale would showcase some Nigerian first ladies using Africa Fashion Week Nigeria to promote good causes. “There will be collections by Ekiti, Kwara and Ogun first ladies and governors, who would be in attendance. “Our Grand Patron and Royal Father, the Ooni of ife will crown the occasion with his team,” she said. NAN reports that the 2019 AFWN was the 6th edition since inception. (NAN)
