President of Youth Sports Federation of Nigeria (YSFON), Dr. Yusuf Gawuna, has expressed satisfaction with the Federation’s on-going U-19 football camp presently holding at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna. According to the Deputy Governor of Kano State, the technical committee of the Federation headed by Coach, Abdugafaru Agboola had done well in the programme expected to be rounded up today. He, however, charged the Sports Ministry and Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to take more interest in the activities of the body as they are poised to develop sports at the grassroots. “I’m satisfied with the camping in Kaduna where seasoned coaches are working on our U-19 team and I hope that by the end of the programme, the players will learn a lot in the round leather game and kudos must go to the technical committee for doing a good job. “I appeal to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development as well as the Nigeria Football Federation to cue into our programme as we’re always there to discover talented sports men and women at the grassroots, which is our major function,” he affirmed. Meanwhile some of the players presently in camp are; Samaila Ahmed, Nuhu Usman, Sadiq Fulani, Garba Baba, Mubaraq Musa, Dominic Stephen and Bright Ejembi. Others are Paul Ejeh, Segun Oyebode, Emmanuel Adeyemo, Wasiu Awoleye and Sukyman Alabi.
