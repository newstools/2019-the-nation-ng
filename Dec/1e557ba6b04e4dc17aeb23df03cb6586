 THE Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has given insight into the constitution of the Interim Management Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). According to him, the idea was that of President Muhammadu Buhari and his reason was that the interim management committee would be able to supervise the forensic audit ordered by him because there was nothing on ground to justify the trillions of naira spent by the commission in the past 19 years. He said in Lagos on Saturday that those crying wolf that the interim management board was illegal, seem not to understand the Act setting up the NDDC, adding that it was in order to establish and guarantee probity, accountability and transparency in the running of the affairs of the commission. The minister added that it was not the first time an interim management had to be put in place for the commission because the last board came in after an interim board which served for about six months. On the furore over the fact that the Senate has cleared nominee for the substantive board to be inaugurated by the President, the minister said it is the prerogative of the president to send names to the senate for screening and also left to him to inaugurate the board when he deems fit. He reiterated the commitment and passion of the President to transform the Niger Delta, adding that he would continue to support the President to achieve this noble objective. The Interim Board is set up to clear the ground for the new board so as to avoid the mistakes of the past and past neglect.
