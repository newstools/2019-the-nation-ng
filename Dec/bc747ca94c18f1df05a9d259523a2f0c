 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday said that it has not taken any decision yet on the declaration of vacancies on 14 state constituencies by the Edo State House of Assembly. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Voters’ Education and Information Committee, Festus Okoye, told The Nation that when the Commission reaches a decision on the matter, it will be communicated to the people of Edo State and Nigerians. Reacting to a statement credited to the Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki that elections will soon be conducted in the ‘vacant’ constituencies, Okoye said that it is the sole responsibility of INEC to conduct and fix dates for elections. He said: “The Commission has not taken any decision concerning the declaration of vacancies by the Edo State House of Assembly, when that is done, it will be communicated to the people of Edo state and entire Nigerians and on the issue of election, it is the sole responsibility of the Commission to fix dates and conduct elections”.
