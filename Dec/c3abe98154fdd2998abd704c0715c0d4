Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa Two suspected armed robbers have been killed by a mob at the Yenizuegene area, a suburb of Yenagoa, the capital city of Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the robbers, who specialized in robbing commuters on commercial tricycles popularly called Keke were accosted and killed at Erepa junction, an area dominated by northerners. A source, who witnessed the incident, said the victims on the tricycle raised the alarm while they were being robbed by the assailants. “The Keke was heading for Erepa junction close to Otiotio when it came under attack by the robbers. The occupants of the Keke raised the alarm that attracted passers-by and other residents. The mob killed two of the robbers while two others escaped “, he said. The source further corrected the impression that the suspected robbers were killed by the northerners resident in the area. “It is not true that only the northerners killed them. It was a mob action involving everybody around the area. We are disturbed that those bad boys reorganized themselves in strategic places stopping Keke and demanding to know their identities. We are calling on the police to take deliberate steps to stop reprisals”, the source said. But the Police Public Relations Officer, Butswat Asinim, who confirmed the development said a patrol van of the police had been sent to the area.
