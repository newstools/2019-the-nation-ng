MANCHESTER United continued their good week by beating fierce neighbours City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. After helping defeat Tottenham on Wednesday, Marcus Rashford opened the scoring from the penalty spot after being fouled by Bernardo Silva – a foul spotted by VAR. Anthony Martial added a second before half time as Nicolas Otamendi’s late strike gave Pep Guardiola’s men hope. The result, United’s second win in a week, condemned reigning champions City to a 14-point deficit from league leaders Liverpool. United signalled their intent early when Daniel James forced Ederson into a save inside two minutes. That seemed to spark their city rivals into action, with a stifled appeal for a Scott McTominay handball as the hosts swarmed the opposing penalty area. As the Old Trafford side displayed their willingness to sit back and counter, it proved one of the most open and end-to-end matches in recent memory. But the hosts might have scored when Raheem Sterling burst into the box and pulled the ball back for David Silva – only for the Spaniard’s shot to be blocked from close range. At the other end once more, Jesse Lingard might have given the hosts the lead when he was played into the box – but his shot towards the far post was toed away by Ederson. In the 13th minute, the hosts were again calling for a spot kick when Bernardo Silva picked out Gabriel Jesus, whose shot was blocked. The Brazilian forward’s effort skipped off the turf and hit Victor Lindelof’s arm, but was not deemed a punishable offence. City pushed forward but it was United who threatened to open the scoring – with Ederson forced into another fine save, this time from Anthony Martial.
