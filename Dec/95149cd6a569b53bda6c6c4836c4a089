Our Reporter  The Senior Representative of Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA),  Mr Sasaki Taigo, has said  the agency was  collaborating with University of Abuja to train 80 students on rice processing technology. Taigo spoke at a workshop on Improved Rice Parboiling Technology and Awareness Creation on Paddy Grading Standard and Grading Manuals in Abuja. He said that the objective of the training was to promote rice processing technologies to the university students and farmers in the area. Taigo said that the training was also to ensure high productivity and quality of rice produced and to promote adoption of the technology among the participants. He explained that parboiling rice technology involved partial boiling of the paddy before milling to increase its nutrition value, to change the texture of cooked rice and reduce breakage in milling. Taigo said that parboiling was done in three steps such as soaking, steaming and drying. He said that JICA had cooperated with the Nigerian government to implement various socio-economic development programmes in agriculture, transport, education, environment, power and health sectors. Taigo said “JICA and the university management decided to collaborate in ensuring that some relevant students and farmers/processors within the school locality profit from the knowledge.” He urged the participants to pay adequate attention to the training and disseminate the knowledge acquired to other colleagues who did not have the opportunity. Prof. Abdulrasheed Na’allah, Vice Chancellor of the university said the university was committed to ensuring that the collaboration would continue to be strengthened. Mr Akin-Davies Tinuala, Chairman FCT Chapter, Association of Small-scale Agro Producers in Nigeria, said the training would help the farmers adopt improved rice parboiling technology in the country.
