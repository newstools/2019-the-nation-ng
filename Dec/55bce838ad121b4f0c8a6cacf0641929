FIFA match agent and stadium facilities expert Ebi Egbe has declared that  Bayelsa sports would be re-jigged when David Lyon takes over as Bayelsa State governor early next year. Speaking on the margins of the Imo sports summit in Owerri, Egbe  said Bayelsa would soon join the league of  states using sports to drive development. “I’m impressed with what Emeka Ihedioha is doing with  sport in  Imo  State,” he said. “Our incoming governor in Bayelsa State already has a blueprint for sports and don’t be surprised to see Bayelsa coming up with fresh ideas on how to take sports  to the next level; any state that wants to fight crime and empower her youths must make sport a priority.” The Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle also harped on the need for states to invest in  sports facilities.
