Taiwo “Esepo” Agbaje, the national featherweight champion, has expressed delight at winning the Mojisola Ogunsanya Memorial Trophy for the best boxer at GOtv Boxing Night 20 on Saturday at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. Agbaje claimed the cash prize of N1 million attached to the trophy after knocking out Olusegun “Embargo” Moses in the fourth round of a featherweight challenge duel. Saturday’s win was the third time Agbaje has won the award. He previously won at GOtv Boxing Night 17 and 19. Agbaje said he was thrilled to win the award again: “I’m very happy to win the Mojisola Ogunsanya Memorial Trophy for the third time. When I enter the ring to fight, my main focus is just to knock out my opponent and secure a win. But to be considered as the best boxer by the journalists twice in a row and claiming the award three times overall still feels like a dream. I’m very excited and I dedicate this award to my ever-supportive fans.” He, however, said his attention has now shifted to becoming the West African Boxing Union (WABU) featherweight champion. “I’m the national champion, so my aim now is to become the WABU featherweight champion. I’ll continue to work hard to ensure I remain at my peak in order to not just be in contention and win the title, but to ensure that I’m the best boxer in my weight division on the African continent,” he said. In a related development, Nigeria’s Onoriode “Godzilla” Ehwariemi  had on Saturday emerged the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental heavyweight title champion after he defeated his Argentine opponent, Ariel “Chiquito” Baracamonte at GOtv Boxing Night 20. Ehwariemi secured the title after his combination of vicious blows knocked out Baracamonte in the first round of the 12-round fight, which held at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos.
