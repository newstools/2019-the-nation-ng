Chris Oji, Enugu  The Enugu State Chapter of the All Progressive Congress ( APC) Monday dismissed rumours making the rounds that former Senate President, Ken Nnamani has concluded plans to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP). The party said on Monday there was no iota of truth in the speculation. An online media had recently reported that the former Senate president and APC chieftain was making plans to return to his former party (PDP). But Dr Ben Nwoye, the chairman of APC in the state, said those behind the rumour hate APC and restated that it was falsehood. Describing the former Senate President as a patriotic Nigerian, Nwoye pointed out that the former number three citizen worked hard for the reelection of President Muhamadu Buhari in the last general election. He recalled that when the former Senate President joined the party, he spoke to the press and wondered why people were speculating that he was defecting. The Enugu APC chairman further recalled that Nnamani was in charge of the Buhari Campaign in the entire South in the last general election, noting that he saw to it that the party succeeded in the South. He, therefore, appealed to people especially the Igbos to show some respect to our leaders before they make a statement that tarnishes the image of our leaders. Nwoye further advised people to consider the political interest of the South and the overall interest of the country as a whole before spreading falsehood. He insisted that politics is not driven by falsehood and character assassination, adding that Nnamani has the capacity to communicate to the public about his political position. ” He has remained an active and valuable member of the APC whose reasoned opinion is highly valuable to the APC both at the regional and National Level. ” Those who have orchestrated this falsehood should look for positive means of channelling their energy. politics is not driven by falsehood and character assassination” he said.
