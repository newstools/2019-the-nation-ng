By Victor Akande  THE concert of music talent hunt show, Access The Stars, is set to hold on Sunday at the Shoprite Onitsha Mall, Anambra. This is coming after two days of auditions at Dolly Hills Hotel on Thursday and Friday. Last week, the show was in Calabar, Cross River State. In closing the auditions that took place at the Venetian Arena in Calabar, music fans were treated to performances by some of Nigeria’s finest entertainers at the Old Parade ground penultimate Friday. Seyi Shay and Dare Art Alade engaged the fans in memorable sing-along moments. The top five selected talents from the Calabar auditions also made it a night to remember as they sang their hearts out in hopes of impressing the judges. At the end of the night, two lucky contestants made it through to the next round, and both stars were clearly elated after being selected.  Seyi Shay, who has been enjoying her time as a Judge on the show, had expressed her expectation for the show’s berth in Onitsha. “Every city we’ve visited has produced lots of awe-inspiring moments,” she had said. “I know Onitsha will not disappoint and I can’t wait to meet some amazing singers in the city.” Access the Stars music reality show was created by Nigerian Breweries Plc and Access Bank Plc to provide a platform for budding singers to harness their talents and get a chance to shine alongside Nigeria’s biggest stars.
