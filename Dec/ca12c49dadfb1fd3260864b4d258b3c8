By Daniel Essiet  The Lagos State Government has alerted livestock owners to be alert to any signs of charcoal anthrax disease in their livestock. Charcoal anthrax is an infectious disease of livestock that can cause sudden death. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal, gave the warning yesterday in Lagos  when he met with members of the Sheep and Goats Farmers Association to sensitize them on the reported outbreak of Charcoal Anthrax in sheep and cattle in the Republic of Niger . He urged them to report any unexplained sudden deaths of livestock to the ministry. According to him, such reports would help the State Government carry out quick and appropriate investigation with a view to instituting all necessary control measures.  The Commissioner also called on private veterinarians to assist with investigation and prevention activities. He said the disease occurs directly or indirectly through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products hence, the need to take precautionary measures. Lawal, therefore, urged  livestock farmers to take necessary precautions to prevent the incursion of the disease into the country, adding that the State Government has already constituted Rapid Response Teams that would react and respond to any case of an outbreak.
