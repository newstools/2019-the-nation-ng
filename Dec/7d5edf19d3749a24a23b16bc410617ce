By Taofik Salako, Capital Market Editor Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc has won the 2019 Sectoral Leadership Award for the healthcare (pharmaceuticals) sector at the Nigerian stock  market. The annual award, which is based on the performance of quoted companies on the Nigerian capital market, was organised by Pearl Awards. Neimeth came top ahead of two other nominees, all leading pharmaceutical companies quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The recent award was the second of such awards in the capital market to be received by Neimeth this year. Recently, Pharm. Matthew Azoji, Managing Director of Neimeth was named among the BusinessDay’s top 25 CEOs in Nigeria  in recognition of the performance of the company. Neimeth is one of Nigeria’s leading pharmaceutical manufacturing companies and has over the years continued to improve her financial performance, which has caught the watchful eyes of regulators of the Nigerian capital market. Azoji, who received the award in Lagos, said the Pearl Award and others before it are certificates that will motivate the company to strive to do better.  “Our strategic plan is to move Neimeth from a good company to a great company. We shall soon launch a five-year strategic plan to reposition the company to play greater roles in the healthcare industry, ensure good returns on investment for shareholders and provide services that will delight all stakeholders,” Azoji said. Neimeth is over 61 years old as a business in Nigeria. It transited from an arm of a foreign transnational, Pfizer Inc. to Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc in May 1997 through a management buyout of the US investors to become a wholly owned indigenous company. Since then, the company has metamorphosed into a leading brand in the Nigerian healthcare industry with products that meet international standards.
