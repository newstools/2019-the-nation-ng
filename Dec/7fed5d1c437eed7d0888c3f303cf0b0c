Doctors in Lagos State under the aegis of Medical Guild, have rejected the new minimum wage paid to workers by the state government, saying it is below the expectations of civil servants. Dr Babajide Saheed, Chairman of the Guild, made the doctors’ decision known on Monday at a media briefing on the Scientific Conference scheduled to hold on December 3 and 4 in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Medical Guild is the association of doctors in the employment of the Lagos State Government. Saheed declared that not only was the new minimum wage unacceptable, the Guild was not part of the negotiations which was communicated to government, adding that it was still awaiting a response. “You cannot be talking about our salary when we are not there; and when workers started receiving their salaries over the weekend, they were disappointed and unhappy. “Not only the doctors, generally, all the civil servants, because the increment was unimaginable and short of expectations.
