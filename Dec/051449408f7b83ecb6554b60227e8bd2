The Customs Area Controller of Area II Command, Onne Port Rivers State, Comptroller Aliyu Saidu, has charged newly promoted officers in the command to justify their elevations with honesty and hard work. Saidu, who gave this charge while decorating newly promoted officers in his Command with their new ranks, said promotions are clarion calls to higher responsibilities. “From this moment you should also see yourselves as role models to your subordinates, leading by example and keeping to directives as contained in the Customs and Excise Management Act including other books of instruction. “The Controller General and Nigeria demands more dedication to duty from us and the motivation of promotion should spur us to do more while also encouraging our stakeholders to be compliant at all times, “ Saidu said at the brief decoration ceremony.  For those that are yet to be promoted, the Controller urged them to be unrelenting in steadfastness as other opportunities for promotion will come their way. “I am optimistic we will have to come together and celebrate again because some other officers will also be promoted. Continuing, he stressed that ‘’with the calibre of officers here the revenue target and goals of 2019, should be achieved in a few weeks. Don’t wait till the end of the year,” he charged his men. Responding on behalf of the newly promoted officers, Deputy Comptroller Timinadi Bomodi, expressed happiness for the honour done them while promising the Nigerian Customs Service especially the Comptroller General of Customs Col. Hammed Ibrahim Ali (rtd) of their unalloyed commitment and to match expectations with hard work.
