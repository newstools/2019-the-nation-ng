Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) has said the actualisation of safety regulation is a key component for an effective judiciary. This, he said, would make Lagos safe for everyone. The commissioner, who spoke on Thursday at a safety advocacy programme organised by the Lagos State Safety Commission with the theme: “Actualisation of Safety Laws and Regulations in Lagos State”, said that safety regulation would enable Lagos State to lift its head among other global economies. Onigbanjo, represented by the Director of Public Prosecution, Ministry of Justice, Jide Martins, said that safety regulation would enable the state to excel. He said Lagos State had had too many accidents that could have been averted if adequate judicial infrastructure that handled safety cases and emphasised the need for public compliance across board had been put in place. The Director-General of the agency, Lanre Mojola, said safety regulation is critical to the success of safety in Lagos, hence the establishment of the agency to ensure the safety of lives and property.
