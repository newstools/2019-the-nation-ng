By  LUCAS AJANAKU  It has been quite a busy year for Tecno as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) tried to balance profit with corporate social responsibility, it said in a statement. According to the statement, the smartphone brand set out at the beginning of the year to touch lives and make it evident that the brand is one that cares for it host country. “As the year ends, Tecno has accomplished all we promised to do, especially in the CSR department. We have differentiated our brand in more ways than one. “In 2014, Tecno started a children-centered CSR initiative that has seen to ensuring that many children from public primary schools across Nigeria win scholarships and many other prizes.  “In line with that initiative, the theme on Children’s Day this year was: Give the Nigerian Child A Future. In the Lagos region, five schools were selected to participate. After an examination to select the best students, scholarships were awarded to five students from each of the schools through the Tecno Foundation,” it said. According to the OEM, there was also a Children’s Day Party that brought children from over 30 public schools together with plenty of fun and games plus numerous gifts. “Tecno  got involved in another Get-a-Nigerian-through-school project called AcadaFest Scholarship 2019. Through this initiative, Tecno sponsored three deserving students for the duration of their university education,” it said.
