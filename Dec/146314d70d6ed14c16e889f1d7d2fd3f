Weeks after regaining freedom from his kidnappers, the monarch of Tarakiri clan, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, HRM King George Week, has passed on. It was gathered that the 81-year-old traditional ruler and father of the Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Doodei Week, died of the torture and psychological trauma he suffered in the hands of his abductors. The monarch was kidnapped from his palace on October 2 by gunmen during the build-up to the November 16 governorship election, but was released on October 27, about 25 days after the incident. The Social Media Aide to the Commissioner, Mr. Elaye Yagila, in a brief citation on the life of the monarch, blamed his death on the kidnappers. Narrating the circumstances that led to his death, he said: “King George Agbabou Week’s journey to the great beyond started on October 2, about 12:45am, when armed men abducted the late monarch. “He was taken away from his country home, Anyama-Ijaw, to unknown destination almost naked after thoroughly ransacking the house, torturing his wife and children. They made away with belongings worth millions of Naira alongside a 200hp speed boat at the waterside belonging to his son, Prince Doodei, who is the Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources. “On October 27, exactly 25 days after the incident, the monarch regained freedom from the kidnappers.
