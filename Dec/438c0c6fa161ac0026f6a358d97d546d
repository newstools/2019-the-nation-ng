Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has presented N480 million as life insurance premium benefits to 258 families of deceased employees of the state government. Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Yetunde Arobieke, on behalf of the government, presented the premium benefits to the families of some late local government workers and primary school teachers at the weekend in Alausa, Ikeja. The governor urged the families to keep alive the dreams and wishes of the deceased by ensuring that the money was judiciously spent, especially to educate the deceased’s children and impact on the lives of other dependants. He said: “This occasion of letter presentation to the families of the deceased workers is one fulfilment of the many welfare packages of the government to its workforce. The workers are the engine room and drivers of our policies and are germane to achieving the Greater Lagos initiative project.” Sanwo-Olu said his administration prioritised workers’ welfare, as only a motivated worker could perform optimally. “This is why this administration has taken staff development and welfare as one of its cardinal policy thrusts,” he added. The governor said what was being given to the beneficiaries was outside the usual gratuity and pension benefits being paid promptly to retired workers. “In realisation of today’s exercise, the families of the deceased workers comprising 152 deceased primary school teachers and 106 local government workers are to collect N480 million as life insurance premium benefits,” he said. The General Manager of LASACO Assurance, Segun Balogun, represented Dimeji Olona, thanked Governor Sanwo-Olu for ensuring that workers are comfortable when alive and their families are taken care of when they die. He implored the recipients to spend the money judiciously.
