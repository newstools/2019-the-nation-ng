He disclosed that that Pastor Adeboye comes for the event once every two years. His words: “The programme is (Pastor Adeboye’s) first outing after the Holy Ghost Congress of 2019. So, Oyo State is very fortunate indeed. Pastor Adeboye will pray for the government and people of Oyo State. “He will decree safe landing into 2020; he will minister to the sick and the weak, businesses, youths and students at Liberty Stadium, Ibadan; NYSC Camp, Iseyin and Ogbomoso High School, Ogbomoso. Christians are not expected to sit in the comfort of their churches. “When Christians go silent, it gives a cause for concern. We are not to go silent; we are expected to evangelize daily. One-on-one evangelism has to be intensified.” In each of the venues, the General Overseer (G. O.) is expected to pray for peace and progress of the state and the people. The RCCG, Region 21 comprises 13 provinces in Ibadan, and one each in Ogbomoso, Oyo and Iseyin.
