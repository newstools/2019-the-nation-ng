A five-year-old boy has been abducted during a service at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, Ekwulobia, Anambra State. The victim, Chimaobim Kosi Ayinkor, was said to be playing with his siblings on the field in the church compound when he was kidnapped. A member of the church, who preferred anonymity, said the boy was abducted by a yet-to-be identified man, who deceived his elder sibling to go and buy sachet (pure) water for him opposite the church, while he carried out the act. Confirming the incident, police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said that the kidnap occurred on Sunday during service while the children were playing on the church field. He said: “Mr. and Mrs. Ayinkor Umego of Okpo village, Ekwulobia reported at the Aguata Police Station at about 9am that his wife prepared their three children for service at St. Joseph Catholic Cathedral Church, Ekwulobia.” “However while the children were playing on the field within the church premises, a man, whose identity is unknown, called the eldest child and sent him to go and buy three sachet water opposite the church. “Before he returned from the errand, the man had disappeared with his younger brother, Chimaobim Kosi Ayinkor, aged five, to an unknown destination. Efforts to find him by the parents have proved abortive. “Following the report, the police have circulated a wireless message to divisions/formations through the control room, while effort is being intensified to find the missing child, who is dark in complexion, about 3 feet tall and without a tribal mark.” Mohammed urged parents and the public to be wary of strangers. “The command enjoins people with useful information about the child’s whereabouts to report at the nearest police station or through a designated police emergency number,” he added.
