An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Thursday sentenced two men to two-years imprisonment each for attacking a Police Inspector Hosea Guruti, with weapons. Magistrate (Mrs) Bola Osunsanmi, pronounced the verdict on the two convicts, Biodun Ademoye, 18, and Abiodun Omotosho, 27, following their guilty plea to a four-count of conspiracy, assault, extortion and breach of the peace brought against them by the Prosecution. Magistrate Osunsanmi in her judgment did not give them an option of fine. ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde told the court that the defendants committed the offence with others still at large, on November 14 at Bolade Street, Oshodi. ASP Ayorinde had earlier told the court that the complainant, a Police officer, had driven to the street and parked his car to eat in a restaurant. He said that the defendants accosted him and demanded that he should pay for parking his car on their street. He said that the complainant, Inspector Guruti, however, insisted on finishing his food before making any payment. He said that when he refused, the defendants pounced on him, beat him and broke his head with a weapon. He said the Police Inspector was rescued by a Patrol team which was passing by at the time of the incident. He said that the defendants were arrested while their accomplices escaped. He said that the defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by “extorting money, harassing passers-by and unlawfully assaulting” a police officer. Delivering judgment in the matter, Magistrate Osunsanmi sentenced them as charged, to two years imprisonment without option of fine. She said the sentence will serve as deterrent to others who may want to engage in similar acts.
