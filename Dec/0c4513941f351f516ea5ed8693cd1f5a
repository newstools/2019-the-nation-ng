Three moms have emerged winners of the 2019 Mom of the Year competition organised by the Three Crowns Milk, Nigeria’s leading Low cholesterol milk from the stable of FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria Plc. The winners, who emerged from a list of five smart moms shortlisted from among over a hundred thousand entries received across Nigeria for the final stage, just like last year, would be heading to Dubai any moment from now for an all-expense paid holiday with their family members. The three lucky winners, Mrs. Kafayat Salami, a secretary from Oyo State; Mrs. Abigail Oluwasegun, a farmer from Lagos State and Ms. Chinwe Okoroafor, a trader from Delta State emerged during the grand finale of the highly contested competition held recently in Lagos. These three winners will be crowned to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Dubai with three members of their families and will also receive a year’s supply of Three Crowns Milk; while runner-up contestants win consolation prizes, including kitchen makeovers and a range of Three Crowns Milk products. Speaking at the event, the Marketing Director for Friesland, Chris Wulff-Caesar said Three Crowns Milk, a brand that advocates for healthy eating and healthy lifestyle, focuses on moms who are actually the hearts of the homes.
