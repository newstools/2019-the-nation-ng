 THE forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is yielding positive results, Niger Delta Affairs Minister of State Senator Tayo Alasoadura said on Tuesday. He spoke when he received a delegation from Arogbo Ijaw Kingdom in Ondo State, led by Oba Z. D. Egbunu in his Ijapo, Akure residence. According to him, the Buhari administration will work towards opening other seaports. He said: “I have suggested to my colleague, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the need to support Olokola seaport. “What makes Lagos the commercial nerve centre in our country is the seaport and we are going to achieve it. Our focus is to do legacy projects that all Niger Deltans will be proud of.” Justice C.E.T Ajama (rtd), who spoke on behalf of the kingdom, praised the President for appointing Alasoadura. He urged the ministry to fix the Agadaba-Obon bridge that was abandoned by NDDC, among others.
