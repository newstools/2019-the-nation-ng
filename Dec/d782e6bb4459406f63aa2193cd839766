 Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma alumni association Lagos chapter has launched a N100m Appeal Fund for the upgrading and renovation of the university’s health centre. At a well-attended Fundraising and Awards Dinner in Lagos, chairman, AAU Alumni association Lagos Chapter, Mr. Chris Iyere decried the preventable deaths and loss of lives in the university community as a result of the poor state of the health centre on the campus. Iyere said a visit to the health centre revealed that the facility was operating with obsolete equipment, some dating back to the 80s when it was established. “It is appalling that students are still dying due to common malaria as there is no modern diagnostic equipment for proper tests.  The building is in a shambles; no beddings in the wards. It calls for serious introspection and action,” he said, urging the alumni of the university to donate generously to the fund. In his goodwill message at the occasion, the Pro-chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of AAU, Chief Lawson Omokhodion, praised the Lagos chapter of the AAU alumni group for its decision to give back to the university that made them what they are today. Omokhodion who was represented by Mr. Osezua Abhulimen, an alumnus, said the Governing Council inaugurated in October 2018 had been  tackling  the problems of dearth of infrastructure in the university, wrong deployment of academics, deficient international linkages, inadequate funding of the university among other challenges. He praised the Visitor to the university and Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, for his support to the Council to turn around the fortunes of the University.
