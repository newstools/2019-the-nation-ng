IT was a gathering of stars as Dayo Amusa premiered her new movie, ‘Omoniyun’ last Friday at the Ozone Cinemas, Yaba, Lagos. In attendance were celebrities like Iyabo Ojo, Sotayo, Bimbo Thomas, Toyin Alausa, Odunlade Adekola, Muyiwa Ademola, Seilat Adebowale and others. Set in 1987, ‘Omoniyun’ is the story of a community nurse with unrivalled love for children and her radical fiancé, Fijabi, who wrestles a tyrannical prince, Sodeke, and his desperate loyalists, Elemide and Romiluyi over the fate of a violated minor, Fiyinfolu. The premiere started by 7pm after a musical performance from the producer, Dayo Amusa. A section of the red carpet looked like a picturesque scene ripped from a 1978 album of a sitting room; a land phone sits comfortably beside a gramophone and a well-cushioned loveseat. When asked why the producer had to go this far in premiering a movie on girl child advocacy, she simply said, ‘because every child is as precious as coral beads and must always be treated so.’
