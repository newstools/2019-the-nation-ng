Police Affairs Minister Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi has assured the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) of decent and affordable housing. The minister noted that a good shelter is a prerequisite for effective service delivery. Dingyadi spoke when the management of Family Homes Fund Limited visited him in his office in Abuja. The minister expressed displeasure at the dilapidated state of the police barracks across the country.  He hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for according priority to decent and affordable housing for Nigerians and the police through the fund. Dingyadi also noted that affordable homes for police officers, particularly after retirement from service, were important. The minister assured Family Homes Fund of his ministry’s readiness to partner the fund. He said the proposed 1,000 units for the police may be inadequate, considering the number of officers who need accommodation, since it is meant to reach every state in Nigeria. Managing Director of Family Homes Fund, Femi Adewole, explained that the fund was established two years ago as a joint venture between Federal Ministry of Finance and sovereign authority.
