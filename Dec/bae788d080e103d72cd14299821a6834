The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders( COSEYL) on Friday said the opening of Nigerian borders by President Muhammadu Buhari for other African countries to enter without visa is a dangerous policy that will lead to insecurity and unhindered operation of terrorist groups in Nigeria. In a communique issued by the coalition,  the President General of the organisation, Goodluck Egwu Ibem noted that the policy if not stopped immediately would  lead to over population and hunger. “It will also lead to a situation where terrorists groups like Boko Haram, ISIS and others will come into Nigeria without anybody seeing or arresting them.The country is already overpopulated and we don’t have enough food to feed the people who are citizens of Nigeria and our borders are opened for foreigners who have no identity or whatsoever. He noted that places like Ebonyi State and some northern states have been invaded by foreigners, adding: “Indigenes of these states can’t move freely again in their communities and towns for fear of being  attacked.” He described the policy as anti-people policy, wondering why the border is opened to foreigners to enter the country when the same border was closed against entry of goods and services.The border closure has made it impossible for exporters to exports Nigerian made goods out of the country and importers of raw materials for our local industries can no longer do so. “No country anywhere in the world will open its borders wide for foreigners to come in unchecked . Any country that opens its country borders the way Mr. President just said , is calling for a disastrous situation that may lead to economic and social crisis. “We call on Mr. President to as a matter of urgency rescind this policy and send back those who have already entered the country without any visa for the security and well-being of Nigerians.”
