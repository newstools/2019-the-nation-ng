The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has urged the state Police Command and other security agencies to unravel the misery surrounding the violence that erupted during the Saturday’s Council poll. Fayemi equally called on the police to fish out of killers of one of the opposition People’s Democratic Party, Mr. Dotun Kosedake, who was killed at Okitiko unit, Araromi ward in Ikere-Ekiti. He, however, commiserated with the family of Kosedake and four other casualties who sustained varying degrees of injuries in the fracas. The Governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode, however, expressed satisfaction at the conduct of the election. He lauded the professionalism of the SIEC officials under the leadership of Justice Jide Aladejana, saying that the hitch-free nature of the election was a reflection of their professional conduct. Governor Fayemi said he was particularly impressed the election held under a peaceful atmosphere as voters and SIEC officials conducted themselves in orderly manners.
