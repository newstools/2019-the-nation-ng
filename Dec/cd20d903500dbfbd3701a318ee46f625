West Ham have sacked Manuel Pellegrini following their defeat to Leicester. The Hammers’ latest defeat on Saturday leaves them 17th, one point above the Premier League relegation zone. Pellegrini departs after 18 months in charge, having been appointed in May 2018 on a three-year deal. He led them to 10th last season but becomes the sixth Premier League manager to lose his job this campaign. As well as their poor form in the league, West Ham were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League One side Oxford United, losing 4-0 in September. West Ham won 24 of their 64 matches under the Chilean, losing 29. The Hammers have broken their transfer record twice under Pellegrini, paying £36m for Brazil winger Felipe Anderson in 2018 before a £45m deal for French striker Sebastien Haller in July as part of a £71m summer spend. They have spent £155m while former Manchester City boss Pellegrini has been in charge.
