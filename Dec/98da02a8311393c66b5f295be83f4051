 TRAGEDY struck in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital on Friday when a mini bus otherwise called ‘Akoto’ crushed three pupils of a private school to death. This incident occurred on the day the primary and secondary school students vacated for Christmas and new year’s festivities across the state. The incident occurred at about 2:30 pm at Ilokun area along the busy Ado-Iworoko road. It was gathered that the pupils were killed by a vehicle, which was coming from Ekiti State University (EKSU) and ran into them when they were about crossing the ever-busy Ado-Iworoko- Ifaki highway. Three of them were said  to have been killed instantly, while others sustained injuries. An eye-witness said the accident was caused as a result of recklessness on the part of the driver of the bus. The source said: “The driver of the bus drove recklessly and ran  into the pupils who were returning home from school. “The dead and the injured were taken to Ekiti State University, Teaching Hospital. It was a sad incident as families of the deceased converged to weep profusely over the loss of the children”. When called for confirmation, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr. Sunday Abutu could not be reached as his mobile phone was switched off. Abutu’s counterpart in the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mohammed Olowo, said the Command has not been briefed about the sad event.
