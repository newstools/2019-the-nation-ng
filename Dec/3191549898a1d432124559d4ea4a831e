By Tony Akowe, Abuja  The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a 2020 budget of N140.383 billion for the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). It also adopting the Conference report on the Finance bill. This followed the submission of the report of the House Committee on Telecommunication led by Hon. Akeem Adeyemi Adeniyi for the consideration of the House. The House also approved about N11.594 billion as 2020 budget for the Universal Service Provision Fund, which is an independent arm of the NCC. Out of the money, N39.297.043 is for Recurrent Expenditure, while Capital Expenditure will gulp N8,129,461. The sum of N20,863,690 is budgeted for Special Projects while N64,208,446 will be transferred to the Federal Government of Nigeria. Also, the NCC is to transfer the sum of N7,500,000 to Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF) during the period, with a surplus of N384, 949. However, attempt by the Chairman of the House Committee on Finance to cause the House to transfer the surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation was rejected by the House. The Deputy Speaker, Hon Ahmed Idris Wase, who presided over the session, said the surplus cannot be merged with the funds to be transferred to the government coffers because it was just an estimate which may or may not be realised. Also presenting the report of the Conference Committee on the Finance bill, Chairman of the House Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke, said the House version of the bill was adopted by conference committee. Faleke said after the passage of the finance bill by both chambers, there were some areas of differences which necessitated a conference committee to harmonise the bill. He said “the meeting of the conference committee took place yesterday and I want to report that the version passed by the House was adopted.” The House unanimously approved the report as presented and the bill will now be sent to the President for ascent.
