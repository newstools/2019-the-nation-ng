The Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr. Muhammad Babandede, has said officers and men of the service have to under-go drug test to ascertain their mental and psychological alertness during official duties. Babandede stated this at the passing-out parade of the third Conversion Course of 509 graduands at the Immigration Training School, Kano. The NIS chief said the drug test is for senior and junior officers, including himself. He said: “You know, President Muhammadu Buhari just inaugurated a committee on drug abuse. We are Nigerians. Every immigration officer is a Nigerian. There are around 28,000 immigration officers who are all Nigerians. “It is not only that we are Nigerians, we have also been empowered with weapons to protect our country and territorial borders. If we don’t have a strategy to remove the syndrome of drug abuse from our officers, it will be very dangerous for us.” “I hope all other law enforcement will do the same. You cannot give arms to people who take drugs. So, the best thing you can do is to start checking the situation. “The first stage will not be infinitum; it will be findings. I will start with myself. That is why I said the drug test starts with me. I will be the first person to do the test; others will follow. “When we found you to have drug in your blood, we will rehabilitate you, we will guide you on how to stop it. We will then conduct another test. I assure you that by the time we do three tests, if the person is not changing, it means that person cannot work with us…”
