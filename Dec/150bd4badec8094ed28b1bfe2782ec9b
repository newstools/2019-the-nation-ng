For deciding to stage the maiden Valuejet Para Table Tennis Open, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has hailed Nigeria while hoping that other African countries would take a cue from this initiative. According to ITTF Classifier, El-Sayed Mehrem, the idea of hosting the international tournament is commendable as few countries in Africa have been able to stage a tournament. “I am impressed with what I have seen so far in Nigeria particularly the hospitality of the people. I believe Nigeria has the potential to rule the world in para table tennis considering its rising profile in Africa. “I must also congratulate Nigeria and the organisers for making this a reality. We hope it can make it to the calendar of ITTF in years to come,” the Egyptian expert stated. The President of Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF), Ishaku Tikon who was represented by the Head of Para Section of the federation, Elderson Bankole, said the idea of the tournament was to ensure that the para players tune up before the Tokyo 2020 as four of them had already qualified for the games in Japan. Secretary General of Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), Olabanji Oladapo, stated that para table tennis players have been a pride to Nigeria in several tournaments, saying that the Vaulejet tournament will throw up more players. For the Head of Business and Programme, Valuejet, Temitope Ajibola, the company would continue to support sports, while pledging their unalloyed support to para table tennis. The tournament serves off tomorrow at Teslim Balogun Stadium with players battling for 44 titles and the N10.8m prize money.
