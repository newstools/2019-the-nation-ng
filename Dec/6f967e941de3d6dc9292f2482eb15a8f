 THE Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, has said that the benefit of physical exercise cannot be over emphasised. He said this after participating in an early morning physical exercises organised by the members of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) in collaboration with the FCT Administration at the Old Parade Ground in Abuja. The minister, who disclosed that he was at the Old Parade Ground in solidarity with the SWAN for their efforts in reporting sports development in Nigeria to the world, also added that he had to be there because of the immense benefits inherent in physical exercises. He commended the members of the association for realising the importance of physical fitness. “SWAN members are journalists, they are professionals, they are not sportsmen and women, yet they realise the importance of physical fitness to their health and that speaks volumes for me and for everyone of us that sports is important for our health, and is important for our well-being.” The minister, while adding that the ministry and SWAN remain partners in progress in bringing about the desired sports development in the country, also commended the association for the line-up of activities to mark the SWAN week. “I’ve seen the line-up of activities for this week and it is impressive. They have taken time out this week in the next six days to also have time to talk to themselves and to also bring professionals in the field of sports and journalism to talk to them in a refresher way and that is important. From time to time, every professional or a professional group needs to take a retreat, take a break, sit down go and put down the pen and learn a few things. I am in full support of your week and ensure the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development will also extend support to SWAN Abuja,” he assured.
