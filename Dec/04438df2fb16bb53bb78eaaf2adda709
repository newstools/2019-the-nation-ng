The rescheduled match day eight of the Nigeria Professional Football (NPFL) clash between Nasarawa United and Kano Pillars ended goalless. The Boxing Day encounter which was played at the Lafia Township Stadium failed to produce a winnerÂ  as Kano Pillars extended their unbeaten and clean sheet run against Nasarawa United in the NPFL to five matches. The struggling Nasarawa United recorded their first league win in nine games last Sunday after beating Heartland FC of Owerri 1-0 in the match day 10 encounter, but all their efforts to consolidate on the win against Pillars was futile as the visitors did everything to pick a point in the game. The result means the rejuvenated Kano Pillars have extended their unbeaten run to six games after their wobbly start to the league. The Pyramid City outfit has won 12 points since the start of December, two more than any other team in the NPFL during the period. The last time an NPFL match was played on Boxing Day was in 2001/02 season when Jasper United suffered a 0-1 home defeat to Julius Berger. A draw leaves Kano Pillars ninth position on the log with 14 points while Nasarawa United occupy the last position with six points.
