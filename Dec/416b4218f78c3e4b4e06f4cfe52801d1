THE Obi of Onitsha, Alfred Achebe, on Wednesday inaugurated the second Golibe Festival aimed at promoting the rich culture of Onitsha people. Golibe is an annual festival of Onitsha arts, music, culture, family and community building, initiated in 2016. Achebe explained that the festival was one of the objectives of re-developing Onitsha into a vibrant 21st century city and globally acclaimed destination for cultural tourism and commerce. The monarch hoped the festival would stimulate growth and employment generation in Onitsha. “Golibe festival is a vehicle for unity and is a good platform for the promotion of our identity as a people,” he said. Chairman of Golibe Festival Amalunweze Anatogu explained that the festival was part of measures to connect Onitsha diaspora population to their roots. The festival will end on December 31. Anatogu listed some activities mapped out for the event to include carol rendition, musical performances, masquerade displays, the ‘Face of Golibe’ pageant as well as amusement facilities for children. He noted that the committee added cooking competition and drama to the 2019 programme
