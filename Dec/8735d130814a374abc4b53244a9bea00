The Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo), has visited the scene of the bloodbath between rival gangs in Aguda and Ijeshatedo axis of Coker-Aguda and Itire-Ikate local council development areas (LCDAs) of Lagos. He later went to the Coker-Aguda LCDA to meet the Chairman, Mrs. Omobolanle Akinyemi-Obe. Mrs. Akinyemi-Obe had requested the presence of heads of policemen of the affected areas and union leaders. Akinsanya appealed to the council chairman to lift the suspension on the unions. Mrs. Akinyemi-Obe last Wednesday announced the suspension of the activities of the NURTW and the Road Transport Employee Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) to ensure safety of lives and property. Akinsanya, who had described the council chairmanâ€™s action as a welcome development, urged the council boss to rescind the decision. He said investigations showed that those fighting were not members of the union. Mrs. Akinyemi-Obe promised to meet the security agencies to review the suspension.
