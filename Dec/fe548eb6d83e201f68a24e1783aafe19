FEDERAL Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and Indomie Fan Club (IFC) have organised the 2019 IFC road safety quiz competition. This year’s competition was held in partnership with the Lagos, Ogun and Abuja sector commands. The event took place at the Lagos Sector Command at Ojodu-Berger, Lagos. Representative of the Sector Commander Deputy Corps Commander A. S. Oyegade said such initiatives would ensure that pupils learn road safety rules early in life. He urged school operators (private and government) to establish federal road safety clubs in schools. Oyegade said the competition assessed pupil’s understanding of road safety protocols after months of enlightenment on safety rules. Coordinator of IFC Mrs. Faith Joshua said IFC believed in the mental development, safety and nurturing of the special talents of children. She said the IFC quiz competition was aimed at evaluating children’s understanding of road safety rules. Attendees were given certificates of participation while 50 IFC-supported schools from councils in Lagos made it to the elimination stage. Lagos Centre Point, Ijaiye, was first. City Campus, Isolo came second while De Royal School, Lagos Island, came third.
