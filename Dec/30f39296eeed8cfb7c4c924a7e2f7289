Adeola Ogunlade  Former Minister of Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, has impressed on professionals the need to support efforts aimed at nation building. Enelamah, who spoke at the EY Alumni Nigeria dinner in Lagos, said that for any nation to achieve sound socioeconomic growth, people must be ready to invest in it. “The challenge for us today in Nigeria is the challenge of leadership, service, mentoring, parenting and raising people with options that are legitimate. People need and want viable options because many people do not know how to earn from their skills without cutting corners,” he said. He stated further that it is sad that people in high ranking offices in government do not see the value of integrity in service and is because they have not seen great people live the life of integrity that they can follow. He stressed that before he joined government, his drive for nation building led to the creation of Africa Capital Alliance, adding that government officials need to create the right environment for growth and create employment for the people to thrive. Also speaking at the event, the former Group Managing Director of First Bank, Bisi Onasanya, charged accountants to be truthful, honest and be ready to damn the consequence of saying the truth. He explained that an accountant must provide the role of an unbiased individual in an organisation, someone who always speaks truth to whoever is involved in the financial position of an organisation, no matter how bad it is. Responding, the Regional Managing Partner of EY West Africa, Henry Egbiki, lauded the efforts of the alumni who took time out to reconnect back to the firm where they got the foundation for their career.
