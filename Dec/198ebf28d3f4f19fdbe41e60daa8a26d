The aim is to showcase Lagos State aquaculture and seafood potentials to the local and international markets as well as stimulate the growth of entertainment and tourism in the State,” the Commissioner noted. He pointed out that with a population of over 22 million persons, the State requires at least 374,000 tonnes of fish per annum compared to a domestic fish production of 155,262 tonnes per annum adding that it is also anticipated that this gap will widen as the State Government’s vision of making the State a 21st Century Economy is fully achieved.
