 Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) yesterday warned candidates not to accept any admission that does not pass through its Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS). The board said any offer of admission not validated on its profile page with JAMB or offered through the CAPS is invalid. JAMB gave the warning in its weekly bulletin sent to reporters yesterday in Abuja by its spokesperson Dr. Fabian Benjamin. The examination board explained that there was a ploy by three unnamed public universities to lure innocent and more qualified candidates from their preferred programmes so that they could accept other programmes. The board said such admission offers were illegal and would not be recognised by the board. It said any candidate who accepts such offer of admission does so at his or her own risk as there will be no regularisation of any irregular or illegal admission. Although JAMB did not disclose the names of the three universities, it put a photograph of the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, in the warning. JAMB said: “In order to circumvent the rights of candidates, the institutions are now using their own portals to unlawfully persuade and pressurise candidates to accept another course and then make a change of course on the JAMB portal to the new course supposedly offered on their own portal. “These tricks are improper and should be disregarded by the candidates. All institutions employing such tricks are putting into jeopardy the future of the illegitimately favoured less qualified candidates as the board will not condone or regularise such irregular admission. “Any candidate who accepts such offer of admission, made outside CAPS, does so at his or her own risk. “There shall be no regularisation of any irregular or condoning of illegal admission. “Appropriate caution has been given to these universities to withdraw and desist from such illegitimate action. Any such act will henceforth be visited with appropriate sanctions.”
