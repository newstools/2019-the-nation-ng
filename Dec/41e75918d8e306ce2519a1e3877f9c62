 The  leader and head of Celestial Church of Christ Genesis Global, Prophet Oladele Israel Ogundipe,  has unveiled a five-year plan aimed at leading souls to Christ while ensuring prosperity. The five-year plan is part of Ogundipe’s Vision 2025, which starts in a few days. The plan according to the preacher, ”will involve all men, not just Christians or members of the church. “Just like Jesus fed the multitude,  my core dream and passion is to build people of godly character and professional acumen to be part of governance and the global entrepreneurial community. A trained mind is a saved soul. We have gone beyond archaic or myopic teaching of biblical literature. As Christians, we must be strategic and practical. Knowledge is power. I crave knowledge like breathing. These are some of the issues that will be addressed in the plan. “As the journey begins for another couple of years, there are plans to enlarge the kingdom of God through our Vision 2025. Children, youths, women, Christians, Muslims, privileged and less privileged will be touched as we spread our tentacles. God is One and Love is God. I preach peace and light. I wish Nigeria peace and our leaders light and more strength to journey on to the promised land,” he said. He added: “I lost my chance at getting education because my parents couldn’t afford to send me to school. Aside being born with lots of empathy embedded in me, I vowed never to see anyone suffer around me. The vision I was given is bigger than me and the last thing on my mind is a distraction. ”My global feat in the ministry was borne out of focus. My call and anointing is pure and as a prophet of this generation, I must dare to break protocols. The only thing constant in life is change.  Our Lord Jesus Christ was a dynamic leader, he never performed the same miracle or preached stereotype texts.”
