Bayero University Kano is set to provide scholarship to 300 less-privileged students in the forthcoming 2019/2020 academic session. The vice chancellor, VC, Professor Muhammad Yahuza Bello, disclosed this, while receiving delegates of the BUK Class ’92 alumni at the Senate Chamber. Bello, who received a donation of N1m for indigent scholarship, described the Class 92′ as one of the most consistent in the university. The VC commended the activities of the forum in various aspects of humanity especially for supporting the indigent students which he said was very apt and timely considering that the 2019/2020 academic session registration would soon start. Earlier in his speech, the chairman of the Class 92′ Forum, Alhaji Dahiru Muhammad Sa’id, said the aim of the forum was to achieve a sustainable educational goal through collaboration with the university leadership and other relevant stakeholders. “The primary objective of the forum is creating a permanent structure that will benefit its members and the society in general,” he explained. According to Dahiru, some of the activities of the forum included, among others, payment of fines/compensations at Kano Central Correctional Service Facility, payment of hospital bills for the less-privileged at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital and financial assistance to families of their deceased colleagues. It could be recalled that the forum had its first reunion meeting in December 2016 to mark its silver jubilee. Since then, the forum has been reuniting constantly. This year’s 4th re-union meeting was tagged, ‘Leaping into the future challenges after retirement: the way forward.’
