A middle-aged man, Mr. Chinasa Ogbaga, has allegedly killed two of his children and left one fatally injured at Okpuitumo community in Abakaliki Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. Police spokesperson Mrs. Loveth Odah on Monday confirmed the incident in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent in Abakaliki. She said the suspect went to the estranged wife’s home where he took the children on the pretext of taking them home to cater for them during the Christmas celebration. Odah alleged that the suspect instead veered off into a nearby bush where he killed the children with a cutlass. She said the suspect had been arrested, while investigations were on to unravel the cause of the incident. Odah said that the suspect would be arraigned after investigations were concluded, adding that the victims were male and female children aged six and four, while the injured victim is two years old. “The Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ekumenyi Divisional Police Headquarters, reported a case of multiple homicide at Okpuitumo community in Abakaliki Local Government Area. “The suspect, a vulcaniser, who is already in police custody, allegedly killed his two children and inflicted heavy multiple injuries on one on December 16 at Egwuagu, Okpuitumo in Abakaliki Local Government. “The suspect is being detained at the state police headquarters. “No individual has a right to take another’s life and as a law enforcement agency committed to securing lives and property, the police will ensure that justice is served by bringing the suspect to book,” she said.
