The Financial Services Innovation Association (FSI), with support from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement Systems Plc (NIBSS), Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) and Flourish (a member of the Omidyar Network) will launch the first Industry Innovation Sandbox in Nigeria. The Industry Innovation Sandbox is intended to lower the barriers to innovation in the fintech industry for young innovators across the country. The topic of the financial inclusion conference which will take place on December 9 at Eko Hotel and Suites is “The Promise of Digital Financial Inclusion – Jobs, Jobs and More Jobs.” Speaking through a press release, Chairman FSI, Lyin Aboyeji said their drive is to make Nigeria a global leader in financial services innovation. “As the Nigerian fintech landscape has burgeoned in the last several years, developers have increasingly hankered for a safe environment to test the viability of their ideas and products, rather than immediately launching into protracted integration and licensing discussions with commercial banks and regulators respectively. “With the innovation sandbox startups will be able to access national infrastructure, national identity, bank and telco APIs from partners like NIBSS,” he said. Aboyeji noted that developers will be able to test their ideas in the sandbox and then decide whether to be a full-fledged fintech company licensed by the CBN or position themselves for partnership or acquisition by an existing licensed financial services provider. “Whatever their decision the FSI will provide support and guidance that ensures the most innovative products come to life.
