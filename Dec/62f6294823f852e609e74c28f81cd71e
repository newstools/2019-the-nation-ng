Jamaican-American electronic dance music trio, record producer Diplo, DJ Walshy Fire and DJ Ape drum headlined the last edition of the Island Block Party (IBL) last weekend at the Lekki special event centre, Lekki, Lagos. It was an electrifying performance as the entertainers who are popularly known as Major Lazer engaged fans with captiving foreign songs as well as Nigerian songs. Diplo held down the turn table, while Dj Walshy Fire and Ape drums did more of hyping the crowd and engaged them in a sing along vibe. But the highlight of their performance was when Walshy Fire dished out some Nigerian dance steps popularly known as Zanku aka Gbese and Diploâ€™s joining in the crowd bare bodied which cheered the fans to the extreme. Skales, Rema, Joeboy, Jinmi Abduls, Buju, Joeboy, AjeButter22, Falz and others also performed at the show. Other celebrities in attendance included Tems, Blaqbones, Ycee, Wurld, Preetyboydo, Daffy and Klef.
