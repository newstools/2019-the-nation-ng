Our Reporter  Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has called on security agencies operating at the seaports to put in place measures to tackle the menace of stealing and breaching of cargoes by miscreants. They urged the Nigerian ports police as well as the terminal operators and security personnel to initiate tight security measures, following reports of alleged pilfering, stealing, and breaching of cargoes at the seaports by some scoundrels erroneously believed to be dockworkers. Secretary-General, MWUN, Felix Akingboye, in a statement said the menace is capable of damaging the image of Nigeria in the comity of nations. The union advised that whoever is caught in the criminal act should not be spared, but be visited with the full weight of the law no matter how highly placed. The union raised the alarm following reports of pilfering, stealing and breaching of cargoes in seaports by some scoundrels erroneously believed to be dockworkers.  “MWUN, being a disciplined and responsible union has zero-tolerance for any form of criminality, as its constitution loathes the same. “The dockworkers of today are refined with individuals, who would not risk their robust terminal benefits by engaging in breaching of cargoes. They know the sanctions that await any authentic dockworker caught in any criminal act,” the statement said. It explained that the erroneous misconception stemmed from the fact that Biometric Identity card (BID), which should have differentiated and distinguished the core dockworkers from the miscreants that daily troop into the ports have not been issued despite repeated demands by the union. “Pilfering, stealing and broaching of cargoes are criminal acts which no disciplined and responsible organisation should condole,” it said.
