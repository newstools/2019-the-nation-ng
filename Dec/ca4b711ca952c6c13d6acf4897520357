Our Reporter  Access Bank Plc has donated 66 laptops to spur the education of underserved children in Nigeria. The gesture is part of its effort to finance a sustainable future for its stakeholders. The gift presentation, which took place on Friday, December 20, at the bank’s headquarters, was made to Slum2school – a development organisation that empowers children in slums and remote communities with quality education. Speaking during the gift presentation, the Executive Director, Retail Banking, Access Bank Plc., Victor Etuokwu, said: “Access Bank understands the challenges faced by underserved communities in Nigeria, hence, we always strive to add value to the lives of the people in communities where we have footprint, leaving them better equipped to succeed.  “Children play a huge role in the future of every economy and we are collectively responsible for them. This is why Access Bank will continue to make substantial impact through welfare initiatives, ensuring that our children have access to education and other basic amenities,” he concluded. Other notable initiatives by the bank in education are the annual Access Bank UNICEF charity shield Polo tournament held in partnership with Fifth Chukker – which has so far provided education for over 12,000 children in Northern Nigeria; the renovation of a dilapidated Information Technology Center and donation of 12 desktop computers at Ikosi primary school, Ketu, Lagos, among others.
