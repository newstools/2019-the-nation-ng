THE President/Chairman, Governing Council, Institute of Information Management (IIM), Africa, Dr. Oyedokun Oyewole, has urged the Federal Government to create National Information Development Agency (NIMDA) to properly manage the avalanche of information being generated by way of data. Oyewole, who spoke in Lagos at the weekend, also faulted the creation of Ministry of Information and Culture, arguing that it would have been Ministry of Culture and Tourism while Information would have paired with Strategy. He said information management entails the proper harnessing and management of information/data mind which naturally belonged to different categories and its treatment accordingly. He said categorisation will enable data to be indexed and deployed to appropriate use by both the public and private sectors of the economy. Oyeokun, who spoke ahead of the group’s National Information Management Stakeholders’ Forum, argued that there has to be information governance in the country.  He said: “We need to have people, process and technology. We are yet to take care of that all-important aspects of people and process, though we have technology. “Going forward, this forum would like to recommend the need for the Ministry of Information and Culture to be transformed and repositioned to enable it take its rightful position as it concerns data, information, records, archives, and contents management in Nigeria.”
