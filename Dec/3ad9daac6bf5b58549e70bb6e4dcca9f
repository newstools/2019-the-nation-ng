An Edo State Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court has sentenced a car dealer, David Kaine, to 18 months imprisonment for diverting N1.4million. He was arraigned on a one-count charge of diverting N1.4milion for personal use without the consent of the owner. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Patrick Agbonifo told the court that David was given a ML 320 Mercedes Benz Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) by Victor Igbinedion to help sell it. He said the vehicle was worth N2million. Agbonifo said David sold the car and converted the proceeds to personal use without the consent of the owner. David pleaded not guilty. The offence, according to the prosecutor, contravened Section 390 (9) of the Criminal Code Act, Cap 48, Vol II Laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria 1976 as applicable in Edo State. Magistrate I. A. Osayande found David guilty and sentenced him to 18 months imprisonment or an option of N150,000 fine.
