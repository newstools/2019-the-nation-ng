By Lucas Ajanaku  The  current state of the workplace in the country is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) for many employees, the Principal Consultant, Corporate Wellness Consulting,  Fola Osasona, has said. He added that current reality is that demands are exceeding capacity, draining people of the energy needed to fulfill their potential. Osasona spoke with newsmen in Lagos yesterday ahead the sixth edition of Corporate Wellness Conference. The confrence themed “Enabling Humans at work” is scheduled for Friday Dec 13th, at the  Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. She said  a more humane  workplace is one that encourages work-life integration, one that promotes people’s mental well-being, strengths and capabilities, leading to the high levels of engagement, meaningful contribution, innovation, productivity and sustainability. According to Osasona, technology links human beings 24/7 to a flood of information, and as humans at work, more and more hours are spent working with little results. She said research has shown that creating a more humane, caring workplace ultimately leads to improved   customer service, better health outcomes and all-around productivity. Executive Director, Wellness Healthcare Group, Mrs Afolabi Adetutu Ibironke, the lead sponsor of the forum, said participants will be equipped with the necessary wellness skills and strategies to create a more humane workplace where employees and business are relevant in the present and future of work. The conference is an annual human capacity development forum organised by Corporate Wellness Consulting with the aim of enabling humans at work to add the value they are. The conference, which started five years ago, is gradually becoming a phenomenon in the minds of professionals at work and has had in attendance over 2500 delegates.
