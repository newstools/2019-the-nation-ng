Folake Oyemade has made a name for herself in the garment industry. With her company, Sam N Sera, she is tipped as a leading indigenous uniform designer in Nigeria. Her pretty daughter, Sally, is also passionate about fashion, and she has opened the door for her. Last Saturday, a boutique, Queen of Sheba New York (QOSNY), was launched in Lagos. Although Oyemade is a co-founder of the boutique, it is ran by her daughter. Social Circuit gathered that Sally studied in the United Kingdom but her love for fashion and desire to create an impact brought her back to Nigeria. Otunba Ayodele Olayiwola, Hon. Folajimi Lai Mohammed, Prince Adeniyi Oyemade (Sallyâ€™s father) and Prince Taiwo Fadina were sighted at the boutique launch.
