 Pilgrims from Lagos State to this year’s holy journey in Israel yesterday offered special prayers for the unity and national development of Nigeria. The service, held at the Ramada Centre in Jerusalem, was attended by dignitaries, including Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf; the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye and Chairman of the state Health Service Commission, Dr Bayo Aderiye. The commissioner urged participants to continue to be good ambassadors of the state and reflect the spiritual aura acquired during the pilgrimage. “In this December pilgrimage alone, we have about 1,000 participants and it’s been a wonderful experience so far. For me, I have learnt how people can live in harmony and orderliness. “I, therefore, want to urge pilgrims to imbibe the virtues from the holy land when they return to Nigeria. We thank Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his unflinching support for pilgrims so far,” Mrs Akinbile-Yussuf said. In his sermon, Commissioner for Southwest representative of Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC), Apostle Anthony Fashipe, noted that Nigeria can only attain its glory through productivity. He urged participants to move closer to God, adding: “There are blessings attached to worshiping God.”
