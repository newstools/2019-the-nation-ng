 THE United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has said there are many unregistered births in Nigeria. This, the global agency said, is at variance with the significant increase in the number of children whose births are officially registered. A new report on global birth registration from the UNICEF noted that although the number of registered births increased from 30 per cent in 2013 to 43 per cent in 2018, about 17 million children under the age of five in Nigeria remained unregistered. “We have come a long way in Nigeria and ensuring that children are registered through the health services is making a big difference – but still too many children are slipping through the cracks. “These children are uncounted and unaccounted for non-existence in the eyes of the government or the law. Without proof of identity, children are often excluded from accessing education, health care and other vital services, and are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse,” UNICEF Representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins said.
