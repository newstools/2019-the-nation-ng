The CEO OF Baggies Exchange Services Limited, Ehonre Oluwaseun, has empowered physically challenged persons to mark his birthday. He offered different skills training through the La Mode Magazine Disability Foundation. He said the gesture was to make living better for them. His words: ‘’ I love to give back and impact lives positively and to add significantly to humanity. I feel fulfilled when I contribute my part to humanity. Empowering persons with disabilities will go a long way in adding to the economy and better their lives as more persons with disabilities will be independent and self employed if empowered. “In addition, I will like to say persons with disabilities should not be looked down upon or discriminated against as they are great asset to the country not a liability if empowered and given all the support they need to succeed’’. The philanthropist popularly known as classic baggie has donated his time, money, experience, skills and talents to help create a better world through charity. Founder of the La Mode Magazine foundation, Mrs. Sandra Odige stated: ‘’There are about 25 million Nigerians living with disabilities and that the foundation empower persons with disabilities by providing job opportunities, skills acquisition training and support. “The foundation also advocates and creates awareness for persons living with disabilities. It is an advocacy awareness foundation where persons with disability are given a voice. “The signed Nigeria Disability bill emphasises the right to life, equality, and non-discrimination for persons with disabilities. Hence, the foundation is creating more awareness on the need for people to show love and support for persons with disabilities’’.
