The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw certificates of return from 14 members-elect of the Edo State House of Assembly. It said their refusal to subscribe to the oath of membership/allegiance for the affected constituencies throughout the Assembly’s first session and first quarter amounted to an abdication of office The All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmakers-elect were not sworn in with the colleagues due to a political crisis in the state. The PDP said the right thing for INEC to do was to withdraw the affected members’ certificates of return since they have failed to function as lawmakers. This was contained in a letter to INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmoud Yakubu. The letter was signed by Chikaodinaka Adindu, counsel for the PDP and its candidates in the House of Assembly election. The PDP opposed Speaker Frank Okiye’s call for a fresh election for the constituencies. It said state resources should not be wasted in conducting fresh elections where there are first runners-up in the concluded elections and where the affected members-elect were not sworn in. “The Doctrine of Necessity should be invoked to issue a certificate of return to the first runner-up in the election to save their constituencies from undue suffering and neglect having performed their civic responsibility of voting only to be denied the dividend of democracy. “We are by this letter demanding/requesting you and your Commission to use your good offices to issue to our client’s certificates of return within the next seven days of the receipt of this letter. “Failure to accede to request in the interest of justice and equity as clearly communicated by this letter, we shall be left with no other option than to carry out the full instructions of our clients by instituting an action in a court of law. “We look forward to hearing from you within the next seven days.”
