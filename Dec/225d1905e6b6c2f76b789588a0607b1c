Former Nigerian international players have berated former defender Taribo West over his remarks against the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Taribo had stated that Nigerian football was ‘sinking’, but his former colleagues dismissed the comment as ‘silly’.
Former utility player Pascal Patrick, who was in Nigeria’s 1996 Olympic gold medal-winning U23 squad and is presently coordinator of the Super Eagles as well as Chairman of the Bauchi State Football Association, lashed West as ‘irrational’ and failing to bring any statistics to the table to support his ‘silly remarks’ about the state of Nigerian Football. “What I know and remember is that this year, Nigeria finished third from the biggest-ever AFCON championship in history (involving 24 teams) and Nigerians are excited about a young and strong team that almost defeated Brazil in a friendly match and looks very promising. “Nigeria won gold and silver in the football event of the African Games in Morocco. Even the losses of the Falcons and the U23 boys in the Olympics race were near misses, as the Falcons only lost out on the away goal rule and the U23 boys lost only one match by the odd penalty goal at the U23 AFCON in Egypt. “Taribo West was appointed to coordinate the 1994 Super Eagles that were honoured by the NFF at the AITEO-NFF Awards earlier this year even though he was only on the fringes and was not in the winning team. We remember how he praised the NFF at the Awards. Now that he has joined those creating a toxic environment, Nigerian Football is ‘sinking’ in his blurred eyes.” Iloenyosi stated that any former Nigerian international joining the band of detractors to poison the same football environment from which they all benefitted should be ashamed of himself.
