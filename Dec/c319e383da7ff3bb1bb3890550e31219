The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says there is no feasible date yet for the resumption of its suspended mass transit train services in Lagos. It, however, said that the project was over 90 per cent completed. The Lagos District Manager of NRC, Mr Jerry Oche, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos that the corporation doubted resumption of the services before the Yuletide. The NRC suspended daily train services including the Mass Transit Train Services (MTTS) in September on the narrow gauge from Ijoko in Ogun state to Ebute-Meta and Apapa in Lagos State. The suspension was to fast-track the completion of the new Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge line which required shifting the existing narrow gauge and relaying it to accommodate the standard gauge rail line. The project is being handled by China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC). The corporation had informed its customers that the suspended train services would resume on November 15, but there seems to be no end to the waiting game by commuters. Speaking on the work progress and possibility of resuming services before Christmas, Oche said: “I don’t see the possibility of resumption before Christmas, but the work is still ongoing and the Chinese (contractor) have redoubled their efforts.
