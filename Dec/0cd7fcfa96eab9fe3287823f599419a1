According to Irefin, the division was also thankful for the promotion of its personnel including the historic elevation of 60 Warrant Officers (WO) to Master Warrant Officers (MWO) within the year. “For us in 81 Division, the year has been a very successful one and we are indeed grateful to the almighty God for his blessings, protection, guidance and wisdom to proceed in everything we do. We thank the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Tukur Brutal for all the support he has given the division to succeed including various accommodations in all the barracks and operations/exercises. “As we speak, Exercise Crocodile Smile IV is ongoing and a lot of resources have been committed to it courtesy of the COAS. Having done all these for us, a lot is expected as we move into thr new year. “We must prepare our minds to be loyal, re-energise and dedicate ourselves to service of the country. We must remain apolitical and do that which we must do to make everyone within our area happy and this country at peace. That is the oath we have taken,” he said.
