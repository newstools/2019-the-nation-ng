 Lille forward, Victor Osimhen scored his ninth Ligue 1 goal yesterday when the he scored against Brest in the 16th minute of their encounter. The Super Eagles forward who scored the only goal of the encounter collected a pass from Jonathan Ikone to bury the visitors and continue his rich vein of form this season. He also has two assist to his credit. The Nigerian striker troubled the visitor throughout and had other chances to increase his tally. He has proved to be a good buy and is setting the French league alight. His latest goal means that Osimhen has netted five match winners for Lille in Ligue 1 this season with Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski and Cirro Immobile  of Lazio scoring as much across Europe top five leagues. The mercurial striker has also been in fine form for the Eagles scoring three goals in the 2021 African Nations Cup qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho after taking over from Egypt 2019 AFCON top scorer Odion Ighalo who retired after the competition.

He was personally rewarded with the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the World Cup as well as Silver Ball as the second Most Valuable Player behind compatriot and captain of the side, Kelechi Nwakali.
