Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri Imo Governor Emeka Ihedioha has approved the extension of the suspension of chairmen, vice chairmen, councillors and political appointees of the 27 Local Government Areas in Imo State by six months. He also extended by six months, the tenure of the Interim Management Committees (IMCs) of the 27 local government areas of the state.
The Chairmen and Councillors of the IMCs were appointed on June 17, 2019 by Governor Ihedioha for an initial period of six months, which ended today. A statement by his Special Adviser on media, Steve Osuji, explained the extension and further suspension were consequent upon the set up of the Committee on Financial Corrupt Practices on Local Governments in Imo State (May 2011 – May 2019) to investigate allegations of financial misconduct against the management of the LGAs. The statement said though the committee was yet to conclude its task, it interim report was damning enough, necessitating an extension of time by the government. It added that Ihedioha acted pursuant to the instrument of suspension of the local government authority in Imo State and having regard to the provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 of the Local Government Administration (Amendment) Law No.28 of 2019 and S.73 of Imo State Local Government Administration Law No. 15 of 2000 (as amended) and all other laws enabling the state governor to so act. In renewing the appointment of the IMCs of the 27 LGAs, Governor Ihedioha noted it was to avoid vacuum in governance. “I do hereby renew the appointment of the Interim Management Committees of the twenty-seven (27) Local Governments of Imo State (names and designations attached), to manage the affairs of each of the Local Governments to avoid a vacuum in governance for a period of six months from date of the expiration of their initial appointments,” the governor said.
