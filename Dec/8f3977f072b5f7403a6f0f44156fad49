 TROOPS have rescued 31 persons including 14 women and 17 children from a Boko Haram hideout in Malam Masari and Gabchari Villages in Bama Council Area of Borno State. One Boko Haram fighter was killed while the terrorists’ enclaves in the area were destroyed, the Army said. Twelve women and four children were earlier rescued from the insurgents along the Cameroonian border by troops who dislodged the terrorists during a recent operation. Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu disclosed that one of the Boko Haram fighters, Abba Modu, voluntarily surrendered to troops. The  statement said, “In yet another display of gallantry and patriotism, the combined troops of 68/94 Battalions of Operation LAFIYA DOLE…conducted an aggressive fighting patrol to a location earlier reported by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE as harbouring some activities of the Boko Haram criminal elements. “The troops successfully uncovered the enclave and proceeded to engage it with devastating volumes of fire. Without any attempt to return fire, the cowardly criminals scampered into the nearby bushes in complete disarray. Subsequently, the troops immediately embarked on an exploitation of this success by pursuing them along their withdrawal route. During the said exploitation, troops discovered the body of one Boko Haram terrorist and further observed several trails of blood along the said route. “Additionally, 2 AK 47 Rifles, 2 AK 47 Rifle magazines loaded with 30 rounds of 7.62mm Special ammunition each, three unexploded mortar bombs for making of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) were captured from the insurgents. Other items equally captured include, one bundle of IED cable, one IED battery, one camel bag, 3 motorcycles, 3 sets of overall cloths, bedding materials, cooking utensils, food items, motorcycle spare parts, 122 cylinder tubes and various mechanical tools.”
