A statement from the company said this notification became necessary, having met all regulatory requirements. Unitrust Insurance stated that all past correspondence, licences, documents and title issued under the former name remain valid. The underwriting firm was established and licensed in 1986 as Unitrust Insurance Company Limited, and has remained as one of the major underwriters of non-life insurance services in Nigeria.

Its name was changed to Saham Unitrust Insurance Nigeria Limited after the investment of Saham Finances in the company, before its current change of name. Its Managing Director, Mr. John Ijerheime, reiterated the company’s passion for excellent service delivery to its customers. He assured that the company has set in plans to ensure that it meets the recapitalisation requirements of the regulatory body, the National Insurance Commission, before the deadline given to the industry to recapitalisation.
