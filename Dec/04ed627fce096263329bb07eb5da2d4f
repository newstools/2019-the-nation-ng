The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Oyo State says it has seized 3,688.5kg illicit drugs and secured 71 convictions in the state between January and November. The NDLEA state Commander, Mrs. Josephine Obi, made the disclosure yesterday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. Obi said that the agency also destroyed 40 and 0.28 hectares of cannabis farmland at Aba Tade in Oluyole Local Government and Igangan in Ibarapa North Local Government. She further said that the agency gave brief intervention to 141 persons who were using illicit drugs, while five others were undergoing rehabilitation. The commander urged those indulging in hard drugs to shun the act because it could destroy their future. She said: “For those who have people using drugs, don’t abandon or victimise them because it is not the end of life. ‘They can come to NDLEA for advice so as to assist them in the rehabilitation process. “NDLEA is always available for any organisation, school and individual  for enlightenment on dangers  of hard drugs and their effects.” She cautioned drivers indulging in hard drugs, especially during the Christmas season, to always remember that lives of people were entrusted in their hands. “Drivers should also always ensure that they do not pick passengers carrying hard drugs. “They should inform NDLEA officials if they notice any of their passengers was in possession of hard drugs,” she said.
