Amosun and Okorocha were suspended for allegedly working against their party in the run-up to the last general elections when they held the fort as governors in Ogun and Imo states. The Ondo governor, Osita and Usani were suspended for indiscipline and alleged anti-party activities But the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC lifted the suspension. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa Onilu, said the decision to lift the suspension was in line with the party’s deliberate policy of fairness and actions targeted at ensuring harmony within the party across the country. He said: “Through the suspension, our party has shown the capacity and willingness to implement its own rules and enforce discipline when there is an infraction. We have also shown that no individual is above discipline and that the party would always apply equity and justice in the day to day running of the party. “We hope the concerned party members will seize this opportunity to fully reconcile themselves with their ward, local government, and state party structures, key into the party activities, and continue to make their own contributions to the growth and stability of the party “We urge them to also take steps to reconcile with groups and individuals that are important to ensuring a lasting solution to any conflict that may exist in their respective states.”
