Normalcy has returned to the Transmission Company of Nigeria’s power station in Osogbo, the Osun State capital as members of the National Union Electricity Employees (NUEE) on Thursday suspended their industrial action. Electricty supply was restored around 4.00 pm to Osogbo and other communities in the state by NUEE. The workers returned to duties following the order of the leadership of NUEE, asking its members to suspend the strike action in the early hours of Thursday. For 24 hours the state was in darkness as the NUEE members in Osun joined their counterparts across Nigeria in compliance with the directive of their leadership to protest the indifference of the federal government to their demands. A staff of the transmission company in Osogbo, who preferred anonymity, said the NUEE may have reason to resume another round of strike action if demands of the union are not met by government. He said the suspension is for a while to study government’s disposition go their demands.
