The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) hailed the Inspector General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, for suspending rally. State Chairman of NURTW, Mr Odion Olaye, said the IGP averted a bloodbath in the state by suspending the planned rally. A former Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon Kabiru Adjoto, said the rally was bound to fail since the government was not aware. Hon Peter Akpatason representing Akoko-Edo constituency in the House of Representatives said it was a shame that Edo had turned into a theatre of war. Akpatason who described the suspension of the rally as a big shame stated that political violence was alien to Edo people.
