The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) State Coordinator in Osun State, Mr. Adewale Adegoke, has paid a condolence visit to the family of a prospective corps member, Fakayode Oluwatosin Jacob. The deceased, who graduated with 3.56 (Distinction) in Mass Communication from the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, Kwara State, died alongside other prospective corps members in an accident along Mokwa road, Niger State on their way to the NYSC camp in Katsina State for Batch ‘C’ Stream 2 orientation. Speaking in Iwo, Osun State, to the parents of the deceased, Adegoke described the death of Oluwatosin as a great loss to Nigeria. Adegoke, with other NYSC officials, prayed for restoration and comfort to the family and other families involved. The state coordinator told the families not to lose their joy, but should in every situation give thanks to God Almighty. The parents thanked the NYSC officials for their love and support. They prayed for the safety of the corps members, who would be embarking on journeys to their destinations after the orientation. The state coordinator also brought greetings from the Director-General of the NYSC, Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, who had admonished corps members against unauthorised and late night travellings.
