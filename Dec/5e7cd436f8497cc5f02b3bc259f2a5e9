Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday inaugurated a committee to interface with members of the public in the implementation of the State’s urban planning laws and regulations. The 13-member committee named Physical Planning and Building Control Appeals Committee will mediate and balance the interest of the citizens and government in disputes that may arise from actions taken in line with the State’s urban development laws. The constitution of the committee, according to Sanwo-Olu, is part of the framework of the Lagos Urban and Regional Planning and Development Laws of 2010, which provided for a public engagement channel for stakeholders and the citizens to channel their complaints to the Government. The governor charged members of the committee to work for the interest of the people, saying the success of the team would be dependent on their objectivity. “It is clear to everyone that we need to have a sustainable means of growth. Every development we embark on as residents of this state must be done within the purview of our physical planning laws.” Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, said he strongly believed the quest for a socially and economically sustainable Lagos could not be achieved without institution of a platform to settle disputes in the interest of all parties.
