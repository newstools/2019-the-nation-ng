 Twenty-One football coaches from six local government areas in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have completed a sponsored National Institute of Sports Basic coaching course. The FCT Football Association chairman, Adam Mouktar Mohammed, who sponsored the coaches, said that the initiative was conceived because the association wanted to train coaches who in turn would impact their wards at the grassroots. “We initiated this programme because we want to build these coaches as the future teachers of talents in the FCT and Nigeria as a whole, “Mohammed told NationSport. “I sponsored 21 FCT coaches from the six local area councils to the National Institute of Sports Basic coaching course at a cost of N90, 000 each.” “This is the first time such has happened in the FCT and we hope to sponsor more in the future,” he added. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Sports (NIS) football practical instructor, Haruna Ilerika thanked Adams Mohammed for the gesture, adding that sponsoring the coaches is the best way to create enabling environment for development of the game from the grassroots as the coaches would transfer what they learnt to the young footballers under them.
