The Special Adviser said the next step, which is the evaluation stage, would begin today, adding,   that the companies that qualified for the next stage would be contacted. Managing Director, Advanced Engineering Consultants, Dr. Peter Agunbiade, who recalled that  the journey to construct the bridge began many years ago, also gave  assurance   that the government would ensure transparency in executing the bid. Permanent Secretary, Works and Infrastructure, Engr.
