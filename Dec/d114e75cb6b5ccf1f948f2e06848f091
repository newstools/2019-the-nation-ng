Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri  Two suspected motorcycle thieves whose names were yet to be ascertained have been set ablaze by mobs in Mbaise, Imo State. The incidents, which happened separately in Umuoma Ogbe and Oboama Nguru communities in Ahiazu and Aboh Mbaise council areas respectively, saw the mobs meting ‘jungle justice’ on the suspects. It was gathered that the suspects have been terrorising Mbaise and its environs. A witness, Dan Ikeagwu, said the Ogbe incident happened around 7:30am when the deceased stole the motorcycle from where it was parked at the backyard of a house in the community. He said the motorcycle owner parked and went into a neighbour’s house while the suspect used another key to move the motorcycle. He said when the owner discovered that his bike was missing, he raised an alarm and some commercial motorcyclists around the village chased and apprehended the suspects a few moments later. “As the youths were beating him, some others brought tyres and set him on fire”, he said. On the incident at Nguru, it was learned that the suspected thief waylaid a woman riding on a bike and intercepted her to cart away some bikes but was caught in the act. But his luck ran out this time around as he was caught in the act by a mob which descended on him, beat him black and blue before setting him ablaze .
