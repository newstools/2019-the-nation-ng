OGUN State Governor Dapo Abiodun has said the long-awaited list of would-be commissioners, special advisers, board members and members of statutory bodies will be ready before December 25. The governor, who hoped that the list would lay to rest speculations, said he would continue to be opened to objective criticisms as it had helped to keep him and his team on their toes. Abiodun spoke at a luncheon organised for stakeholders in Abeokuta. He said he would be opened to objective criticisms, adding that objective criticisms would not deter his administration from realising its goals, but would rather remind his team not to rest on its oars. The governor said that his administration was committed to the rehabilitation of roads, adding that it would in the next 30 days inaugurate the first set of roads it had rehabilitated.
