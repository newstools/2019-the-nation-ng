By Ibrahim Adam  Non-Governmental Organisation, Yomi-Owoeye Foundation has honoured 18 teachers from three primary schools in Agbado/Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Alimosho, Lagos. Six teachers each were selected from Temidire Primary School Oke-Odo, Community Primary School and Anuoluwapo Primary School. Speaking at the event held at Temidire primary school complex, Oke-Odo, Lagos, founder of the NGO, Joseph Owoeye said the event was to celebrate the services of the teachers and their impact on the learners. Owoeye said primary school teachers had crucial role to play in laying good foundation for pupils and should be given priority in welfare and remuneration. “Teachers are the heart of quality education. For quality education, teachers’ welfare and affairs must be taken seriously. The right to education is not only to access education but also the right to receive education of good quality. “Primary school is the foundation of all education. Therefore, primary education and teachers should be given a priority because when the foundation is destroyed, what can the righteous do?” he said. In his keynote address, former Chairman, Osun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Chief Abiodun Owoeye urged the government to improve on the welfare of primary school teachers. He, however, implored the teachers to improve themselves using modern technologies and research. Chairman, Agbado/Oke-Odo LCDA, Dr. Augustine Arogundade in his goodwill message congratulated the awardees and advised them to do more, also challenging others to do better. Apart from teachers, others also received awards – including school managers of the three primary schools; member, Lagos State House of Assembly representing Alimosho Constituency one, Bisi Yusuf; Dr. Arogundade and Executive Secretary, Alimosho Local Government Education Authority (LGEA), Airat Alamu.
