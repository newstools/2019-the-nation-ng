More than eight months after he was reelected as governor and more than six months after he was inaugurated for a second term, Taraba State Governor, Darius Dickson Ishaku, finally appointed his commissioners during the week. But Dapo Abiodun and Nyesom Wike, his counterparts in Ogun and Rivers states, are yet to do so since they were elected or reelected in March. No one seems to know why Wike who is fully in control of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State and has no opposition within the party is yet to appoint a cabinet. Dapo Abiodun, on his part, says he is taking his time to woo credible and knowledgeable people who are doing well abroad to be part of his government. Among the eggheads being courted by Abiodun is said to be a respected female medical practitioner based in Europe and an engineer based in the United States of America. In other words, Governor Abiodun wants a cabinet of technocrats who would help him to perform and has been trying to convince them, according to sources close to him. All that will be known when he eventually does. But that is not the story. The story is that the governor gave some cabinet slots to his party in the state to fill and the party has not known peace since he announced the gesture because chieftains of the party cannot agree on those to be appointed. The governor is said to be highly disappointed that APC leaders in the state are working at cross purposes and that the number of people nominated are so high that he would need another six months to screen them.
