By Taofik Salako, Capital Market Editor  The board of Vitafoam Nigeria Plc will meet tomorrow to consider the appropriate dividend to be paid to investors for the 2019 business year. The foam-manufacturing company had paid a dividend per share of 25 kobo and a bonus increase of 25 per cent in shareholders’ holdings. Regulatory filing indicated that directors of Vitafoam Nigeria will at the meeting tomorrow undertake final review and approve the company’s audited report and accounts for the year ended September 30, 2019. The board will then simultaneously consider dividend payment. Under the rules at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the board is expected to announce its decision before the weekend. Most analysts expected Vitafoam Nigeria to declare dividend, citing its traditional strength of consecutive dividend payment for many decades. Dividend payout may also not be below the 25 kobo per share paid for the 2018 business year, despite the 25 per cent increase in outstanding shares due to bonus shares distributed to shareholders in 2018.  Vitafoam Nigeria’s net profit had risen by 121 per cent to N1.14 billion by the third quarter as increased market penetration, diversified product base and improved internal efficiency brought the company to its best performance in recent period. By the third quarter ended June 30, 2019, Vitafoam Nigeria’s earnings per share stood at 107.66 kobo in 2019 compared with 48.83 kobo recorded in comparable period of 2018. Profit after tax had jumped from N515.2 million in 2018 to N1.14 billion in 2019. The report showed impressive top-down growth as turnover rose from N16 billion to N18.82 billion. Gross profit increased from N4.75 billion to N5.97 billion. Operating profit rose from N1.67 billion to N2.38 billion. Profit before tax leapt from N788.4 million in 2018 to N1.66 billion in 2019.

This represented a dividend per share of 25 kobo, in addition to bonus share of one new ordinary share of 50 kobo each for every five ordinary shares of 50 kobo each.
