 Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Saturday presented the staff of office to the new Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye. Royal fathers from far and near who graced the occasion included Ooni of Ife, Oba Ogunwusi Enitan; Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi; Osemawe of Ondo Kingdom, Oba Victor Kiladejo, and other prominent traditional rulers in the state. Akeredolu expressed his administration’s commitment to non-interference in any transparent process of selection of traditional rulers in the state. The governor said the people’s tradition will not be violated for political expediency, adding that he will continue to support all practices and traditional norms which affirm life. While thanking the Omo-Olowos and the kingmakers for a rancour-free selection process, Akeredolu said the wide acceptance enjoyed by the Olowo ensures unanimity of purpose and unforced collaboration among the people. His words: “The spontaneous expression of joy, affectionate jubilation and fraternal camaraderie, which enveloped the whole kingdom, on the announcement of the choice by all the Omo- Olowo, compelled approval.” While emphasising his administration’s determination to ensure even distribution of social and economic benefits of good governance, the governor said good governance has been deepened under his watch by listening to the people on the challenges encountered and taking decisions based on priorities.
