Nigeria striker, Victor Osimhen, has been certified fit and ready by medical doctors to play for Lille against Monaco today in the French Ligue 1 encounter. Lille manager, Christophe Galtier, had also confirmed the Nigerian to be in top shape ahead of the match at the Stade Louis II. Osimhen was rushed to the hospital after he complained of dizziness and pain during Tuesday’s Coupe de la Ligue 2-0 win against the same opponent. The Nigeria international opened scoring for Lille in the game with his replacement Loic Remy getting the other two goals. “Victor (Osimhen) returned from Monaco yesterday after having passed the medical examinations. They showed that he is fit to play tomorrow,” Galtier stated during his interaction with the media on Friday. “Back with the squad, major thanks to GOD almighty I really appreciate everyone that reaches out to me, GOD bless you all. Another big game tomorrow,” Osimhen tweeted. “He had a very thorough assessment, and today (Friday) we got the green light that he can play. And he wants to play.”
