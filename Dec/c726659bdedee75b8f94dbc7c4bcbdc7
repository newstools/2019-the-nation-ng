 Department of State Services (DSS) on Thursday released Convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare. He had spent 124 days in DSS custody. One of the lawyers to the duo, Inibehe Effiong, confirmed this to our correspondent in a phone chat last night. “I can confirm that both Sowore and Bakare have been released and are now out of the DSS facility at the moment, as ordered by the court. “We will be going back to court tomorrow (today) on the compliance to the court’s order. We are hoping the compliance is total and definite,” he said. Sowore, also the online publisher of Sahara Reporters, had been in DSS custody since August 3. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, earlier yesterday, ordered the DSS to release the #RevolutionNow Convener within 24 hours. The DSS has, on some occasions, acknowledged that it had received a court order to release Sowore, but said it could not just let him go without proper documentation to his appropriate sureties. Justice Ojukwu also awarded a N100,000 fine against the DSS for delaying to serve the defence counsel with additional proof of evidence in the ongoing trial of Sowore and Olawale Bakare. The judge, who appeared piqued by the service’s “delay tactics”, said the fine must be paid to the defendants before the next adjourned date on December 6, 2019.
