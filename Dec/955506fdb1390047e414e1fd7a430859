Earlier in the year, we received a girl and today, we are receiving a boy; this is gender parity as the governor preaches. ‘’We have decided to name this boy Nyesom after the governor.

As a result of his appearance in this family, many great things will happen to the family.” Justice Nyesom-Wike said her office would be in touch with the family to monitor his progress. She said: “We will keep in touch and monitor his progress as he grows. His Excellency loves children,” she added.
