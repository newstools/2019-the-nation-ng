 Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has reviewed the 2019 special end of year patrol as the first phase of the exercise ends. The Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi called on the motoring public to sustain their obedience to traffic rules and regulations, adding that so far, “the road has remained stable”. Oyeyemi also commended the personnel of the Corps across the country for demonstrating absolute “commitment, professionalism and innovativeness” in managing the massive traffic movement recorded before the Christmas celebration. In a press release issued by the FRSC spokesman, Corps Commander Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Marshal expressed satisfaction with the performance of the personnel and conduct of the motoring public in the first phase of the exercise, despite some challenges encountered in parts of the country. According to him, “the fact that traffic movements were orderly in most part of the dreaded points across the Federation toward the Christmas day and no reported cases of commuters sleeping on the road till the following day were reported was a positive development”. Oyeyemi charged the personnel to remain focused and motorists to show greater commitment to issues of road safety, as the second phase of the exercise commences in earnest following the successful Christmas celebration. He particularly commended motorists for improved attitude to use of the road during the Christmas celebration and urged them to sustain the habit by showing greater concerns for other road users who must be given equal right to use of the roads.
