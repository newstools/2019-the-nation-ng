With the Christmas and New Year festivities around the corner, Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has affirmed its readiness to meet the waste management needs of residents during the season and to consolidate on its year round vision of establishing a cleaner and healthier Lagos. In a statement, the Managing Director of LAWMA, Muyiwa Gbadegesin said bearing in mind the anticipated 100 per cent increase in waste generation during the period, the Authority would leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the season was celebrated in a clean environment. He said that the agency had intensified the distribution of black thrash bags for household waste and purple bags for recyclables to residents in the state, adding that PSP operators had been mandated to work round the clock in their assigned areas of operation, while the authority would provide backup trucks. Gbadegesin stated that the authority recently published the list of PSP operators in Lagos and their areas of coverage to enable residents reach out to them when there is a service gap, adding that phone numbers of LAWMA management staff had also been published for the purpose of monitoring the situation of the environment during the yuletide. He implored residents to desist from acts capable of making life miserable for the inhabitants and also seized the opportunity to appeal to motorists to drive with caution, to safeguard lives of street sweepers and other service providers who would be discharging their duties during this period. Wishing all Lagosians a dirt-free Christmas and New Year celebration, he enjoined residents to call the toll-free 07080601020, for inquiries on waste management in their areas during and after the festive season.
