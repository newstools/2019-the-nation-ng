Nigerian Navy has warned criminals to steer clear of the Ondo State coast line, saying it is battle-ready to stem criminal activities ahead of the Yuletide. Commanding Officer, Nigerian Navy, Forward Operation Base (FOB), Igbokoda, Ondo State, Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa, issued the warning while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday. He said his men had been stationed at designated places in the riverine communities in Ondo coastal areas to ensure tight security and rid its waterways of illegalities and criminalities. Ndanusa said such illegal activities included bunkering, oil theft, kidnapping, piracy, ritual killings and other social vices on the waterways. The Navy boss, who assured residents of the riverine areas of optimal security, urged them to always be law-abiding and cooperate with the security agencies in order to bring criminal activities to a standstill. He said: â€œOur Internal Security (IS) team, gunboats and other gadgets are stationed at designated areas on the Ondo coastline and riverine communities in order to ensure the safety of residents both on land and waterways. He urged the state government, through its Amnesty programme, to honor its agreement with ex-militants, who had surrendered their arms and ammunition.
