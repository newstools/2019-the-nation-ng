Olympic gold medalist, Daniel Igali warned sports men and women in Bayelsa against using performance-enhancing drugs while participating in competitions. Igali, who is the state’s Commissioner for Sports Development, gave the warning on Saturday in Yenagoa while addressing the athletes, saying “using drugs to win in a game is not helpful in strengthening talent”. He expressed worry at the development and noted that the state government would not take it lightly with any athlete who resorts to cheating to win medals in any tournament. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the commissioner, who is also the President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), had received the state’s weightlifters who just returned from a competition. They participated in the National Open Weightlifting Championships in Jigawa, where they won six medals made up of three gold, one silver and two bronze medals. Igali commended the weightlifters for their outstanding achievement in spite of the constraints they experienced before their departure. He urged the athletes to always be passionate and dedicated, instead of waiting for monetary incentives before taking part in competitions. The commissioner pointed out that weightlifting offer an athlete the opportunity of winning more than one medal at national, continental and global championships. “I urge you to be up and doing. The state government is making arrangements to sponsor and support athletes to the forthcoming National Sports Festival in 2020 and we are hopeful that you will make us proud,” he said.
