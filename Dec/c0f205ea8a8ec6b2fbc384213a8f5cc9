13-year old girl, name withheld, who was reportedly raped to coma by her step-father, Mr. Sunday Ojo, is still at the hospital, in Warri, Delta state, were she was revived due to inability to pay her medical bill. Though hail and hearty, she is yet to be discharged because her mother, Mrs Ese Ojo, (not real names) is yet to foot the remaining N1 million medical bill for her treatment. The initial sum was N1.8 million. The Nation visited the victim and her mother at the hospital Friday, and learnt that she (victim) could only step out of the hospital on completion of payment. Recall that the incident occurred since October 16. The suspect, who reportedly hails from Emede in Isoko South council area of Delta state, has been at large. Mrs. Ojo, who alongside her three-year old daughter has been residing at the hospital with the assistance of family and friends, called on government to help them offset the bill. “We have been in the hospital for two months and some days now. The money is still the same. We have a million naira left to pay. People have promised but I have not heard anything from them. My daughter cries everyday that she wants to go home. “I am appealing to the president, governor, well meaning Nigerians. I just need them to come and help us to get out of here and probably get another accommodation. Because when I leave here, I cannot go back to that house again. “The three of us, including my three-year old daughter have been living here in the hospital. I am an orphan, my eldest sister is in Lagos, the others are younger to me. They have all been supporting and they raised the money to what we have now.” The visibly healthy teen added: “I really want to leave this hospital. I don’t want to celebrate Christmas in the hospital and I don’t want the New Year to meet me here. I want to be able to go back to school by January.” The Delta state police Command had confirmed the development, stating, “we are yet to arrest the man.”
