 Unbeaten Dan Azeez has added the British light-heavyweight title after a decision victory over Lawrence Osueke at the Brentwood Centre in London on Saturday night. Azeez, unbeaten in 11 fights, crowned a brilliant year by dispatching the previously unbeaten Osueke by a 99-91, 98-93 & 98-92 unanimous victory in their 10-round affair. Azeez won the Southern Area light-heavyweight title after a sixth-round stoppage of Charlie Duffield at Greenwich’s 02 Arena in July. “It was a good experience for me, I have never done 10 rounds before all credit to Lawrence,” Azeez said after the fight. “I think he was a bit negative, He came to survive but i have nothing but respect for him. I didn’t really come out but I still picked up the English title. That is two belts in the year” Meanwhile, Nigerian super-middleweight Umar Sadiq recorded a seventh round stoppage win over Danny Shannons at York Hall, London. Umar, who represented Nigeria at the 2016 Olympic qualifiers in Cameroon and Azerbaijan in 2016, now has five stoppages out of six fights this year. The trained accountant now has a 9-1 record since turning professional in 2017 with six knockout victories and has won six fights in a row since losing for the first time against Zak Chelli in 2018.
