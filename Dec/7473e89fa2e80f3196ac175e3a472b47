With the temperature at 30°c and sometimes climbing to 32°c, Lagos residents are feeling the sweltering heat. An elderly man, mouth agape, ignored the sweat pouring down his face as he tried to pull  his Sport Utility Vehicle out of a crippling traffic jam. Lining the road were young hawkers shouting, ‘Your hanky, your hanky, buy your handkerchief.’ Amid blaring horns, other set of hawkers thrust their basins full of ice-cold table water and soft drinks into the windows of commercial buses packed with uncomfortable commuters. ‘Buy your water, buy your mineral,’ they shouted. Hands shot out of the windows and grabbed the bottles. The hot weather condition in Lagos has for over a month been a source of discomfort for residents. It is believed that the heat is the result of the late transition from rainy to dry season. The lifestyle of residents has remarkably changed consequently in a bid to cope with it. Some have stopped their usual workouts and exercise regimen. Many wear lighter clothes to reduce sweating. And, of course, plastic, hand-held fans are ubiquitous going back and forth across the faces of their holders. Worried about the health implications of the extreme hot weather, our reporter spoke with a medical practitioner, Dr. Emmanuel Anyaehie of Ago Medical Centre, Okota, who confirmed that heat does not directly cause disease conditions, except in the western world where the people have reduced melanin on their skin and could suffer from severe sunburn when exposed to excessive heat. He pointed out that heat rashes and itching which people frequently complain about this period are reactions or allergies to some conditions or due to exposure to certain chemicals.
