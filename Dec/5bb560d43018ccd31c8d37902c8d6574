THE head of a federal agency is under intense investigation for financial recklessness. The head of the agency was said to have come under the searchlight of anti-corruption agencies after his son was caught in Dubai driving a Lamborghini and with $5 million cash. The sonâ€™s lifestyle was said to have been held up by the anti-corruption agencies as evidence that the agency head has been spending money recklessly. Sentry will keep readers posted on further development.
