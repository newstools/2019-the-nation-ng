Eric Ikhilae, Abuja  The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Ibrahim Mohammad has urged. judges in the country to always be committed to their oath of office, and dispense justice without fear, favour or ill will. Mohammad noted that by virtue of their appointment as judges, they are accountable to God in their deeds, and as such, must ensure that they do justice, act honestly and transparently in deciding cases brought before them. The CJN spoke in Abuja on Friday at the swearing-in ceremony of Justice John Tsoho as the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and Justice Benedict Kanyip as the President of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN). Mohammad urged Tsoho and Kanyip not to betray the trust reposed in them by Nigerians. The CJN reminded the judges that the oath administered on them did not call for celebration, but sympathy, because they must allow the oath guide their status, their conduct and behaviour. “Let me tell you here, that even though we need God to help us, but the truth is that God will not help any person, who did not help himself.
And so as judicial officers, we must learn to help ourselves so that God can be of help to us. ” This inauguration does not call for a long speech, but let me remind you that you are holding your new offices in trust for the people and you must not do anything to betray the trust. “You should try, as much as possible, to justify the oath of office you have taken and your appointment by putting your experience to bear in the discharged of your duties,” the CJN said.
