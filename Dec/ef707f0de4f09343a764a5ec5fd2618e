 PALPABLE fears over possible loss of Super Eagles goal-scoring sensation Victor Osimhen in the January transfer window has now gripped the rank and file of the French Ligue 1 side, LOSC Lille. The 20-year-old who arrived in Lille in July has been in great scoring form and only last Friday grabbed his ninth goal in 16 French Ligue 1 matches to command huge interest from several top European sides Europe including Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspurs in the English Premier League. Words are rife that Osimhen might soon be on his way to the EPL after newly-appointed Tottenham Hotspurs’ manager Jose Mourinho ferried the duo of Joao Sacramento as his number two at Spurs and goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos to London. Asked about the future of Osimhen, Lille manager Christophe Galtier said he was not certain that the in-form striker currently valued at 13 million Euros, would still be with the Les Dogues at the end of the January Transfer Window. “Osimhen will stay at LOSC until the end of the season? Yes I think so, but in football, nothing is certain,” Galtier was quoted as saying in a report by BeIN Sports. Meanwhile, Osimhen would hope to add to his two goals and finish a disappointing Champions League campaign on a high against Chelsea tonight. Lille head to Stamford Bridge bottom in Group H after failing to win any of their previous five matches but there are reasons to be giddy after the club secured a back-to-back win in the Ligue 1 especially on the back of the club’s hard-fought 1-0 win against Brest courtesy of Osimhen’s goal. But a win for Frank Lampard’s Chelsea would guarantee the London side a place in the knock out stages regardless of the result in the other group game between Ajax and Valencia in Amsterdam.
