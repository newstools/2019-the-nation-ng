By Munirat Saliman and Nwankwo Ogechukwu  Across the world as people celebrate Christmas with family and friends, Pacelli School for the Blind and Partially Sighted Children was not left out as it hosted parents and well-wishers to its Christmas Carol and drama last Friday on the school’s premises. The programme featured songs, dance, drama and other presentations by the pupils to the delight of guests. The Principal, Sister Jane Onyeneri, thanked sponsors of the event for standing by the school over the years as she called for more support for the visually-impaired pupils. Sister Onyeneri said the school was a non-fee-paying institution that depended solely on donations. “We depend largely on donations from parishes, churches, schools, corporate bodies and individuals, but most times these donations do not come regularly, and as a result leads to delay in implementation of our projects,” she said. In educating the pupils, the principal said the school does not dwell on academics alone but teaches them vocational skills like tie and dye, bead making, production of key holders, table mats, hand bags, tissue boxes amongst others. Speaking at the event, the Public Relations Officer, Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, Mrs. Nneka Ojieh, an alumna, admonished the pupils to be focused and have self-belief. “I urge the current students never to relent after they have left school and believe in themselves – that they can do better than other people – and also take the training giving to them seriously” she said. Fidelity Bank Plc donated five braille laptops to the school.  Speaking on the donation, the bank’s representative, Mrs. Victoria Abuka, said the laptops were donated to motivate the pupils to learn. She said their disability cannot limit their achievements in life.
