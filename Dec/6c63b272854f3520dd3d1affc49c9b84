THE College of Insurance and Financial Management (CIFM) has partnered with various international organisations to boost its status and meet the industry’s present and future requirements. The College Rector, Mrs Yeside Oyetayo, made this known while delivering an address at the 5th CIFM Graduation of Diploma Programmes Ceremony in Lagos where 10 students graduated. She listed some of the international organisations to include Impact Insurance Facility of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Switzerland, GIZ, a German trade facilitation agency and the Centre for Financial Regulation and Inclusion, Cenfri, South Africa. She said: “The efforts of the college have not gone unnoticed and its appointment as the Bancassurance officers in the industry was an attestation to this fact. We recognise that the Nigerian insurance industry requires specific skills to propel it to the next level and take its rightful place in economic development. “Therefore our mission is to provide insurance training of global standards to meet the industry’s present and future requirements’’. The rector, however, explained that the diploma programme which is designed to prepare students for a successful career in insurance was a rich programme that enables students complete their professional examinations within a very short period. In his opening remarks, Mr Eddie Efekoha, President, CIIN, while congratulating the graduands, urged them to keep learning, trying, accomplishing and keep moving forward in the great journey of life. Efekoha, represented by Sir Muftau Oyegunle, Chairman, Governing Board of the College, said that the institute was committed to the development of the college, as evident in ongoing construction work. Oyegunle on his part lauded the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) for its recognition of the college’s capacity to deliver training of global standards to the industry.
