Manchester City assistant boss Mikel Arteta, who has been in contact with the Arsenal board since Sunday is planning a complete overhaul in the troubled team. Arteta has reportedly already identified transfer targets for Arsenal – and has discussed this with the board ahead of getting the manager’s job. Freddie Ljungberg has been in temporary charge of the Gunners since Unai Emery was sacked, but results have been poor under the Swede. According to The Independent, Arteta spoke to the Gunners board about the staff he wants to bring in, amid claims there will be a complete reshuffle at Arsenal. Arteta is also said to have spoken about potential transfers to the club, although will have to wait until January before he can start signing new recruits. Arsenal are floundering down in tenth in the Premier League, seven points off Chelsea who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot. The Gunners were thumped 3-0 by Manchester City last time out.
