The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned what they described as the unwarranted calls for the prosecution of Chairman and CEO of Air Peace airline, Allen Onyema over allegations of fraud yet to be proven. Speaking to newsmen at a media the parley on Monday, the National Public Relations Officer, NANS, Comrade Azeez Adeyemi said, “It was important to note that as students, we are not unaware of possible international politics that might be targeted at the CEO of Air Peace especially after giving back to his country by bringing hundreds of Nigerian home free of charge, rescuing them from the hands of animals in South Africa.” He further noted that although the Air Peace boss said he had never laundered any money, adding that he transferred his money for purchase of the aircraft through the Central Bank of Nigeria, he has also called on the American government to contact the receiver of the fund which is an American company, since the company is still in business. He, however, said that the travails of Mr Onyema will not deter them from identifying and appreciating philanthropists, especially lovers of students. In a related development, the students body also lauded the humanitarian services being rendered by various people, noting that someone like Dr. Teniola Adesanya, the Group Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Group, who recently bailed out over 85 students and saving them from dropping out of school, was worthy of emulation. The high point of the occasion was the conferment of award of Youth Ambassador on Dr. Teniola Adesanya in recognition of his outstanding philanthropic gesture over the years.
