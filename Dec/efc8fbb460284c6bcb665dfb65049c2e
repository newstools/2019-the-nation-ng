Sanni Onogu, Abuja  The Senate on Thursday urged the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, urgently scale down the number of checkpoints on Federal Highways across the country. The upper chamber also called on Adamu to direct officers of the Police Force to eschew alleged extortion of motorists while carrying out stop and search on the roads. According to the Senate, reduction in road block has become necessary to reduce the gridlock on the nation’s roads. These resolutions of the upper chamber followed the consideration of a motion moved on the floor by Senator Chukwuka Utazi (PDP, Enugu North). Utazi, coming under order 42 and 52 of the Senate standing rules, in his motion titled “National Security versus Disproportionate Road Checkpoints on Federal highways in the country”, said that the National Security architecture of Nigeria has been stretched beyond its elastic limits. According to him, acts of criminalities have put untold pressure on the country’s national security architecture, necessitating and compelling security agencies to confront security breaches headlong. Utazi noted that as a consequence, the imposition of road checkpoints on almost all federal highways in all geo-political zones of Nigeria. The lawmaker stated that while road blocks are necessary to curb criminal activities, its abuse for unintended purpose is reprehensible. He stated that the Senate “will not renege in our responsibilities when the masses of this country complain that government police meant to protect them has been turned into an oppressive conduct by those concerned and which the IGP and people of his ilk may not be aware.” Also on Thursday, the Senate has referred President Muhammadu Buhari’s request for the confirmation of the appointment of the Chairman and Members of the National Hajj Commission to its Committee on Foreign Affairs.
