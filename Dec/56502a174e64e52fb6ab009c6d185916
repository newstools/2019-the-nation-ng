A pastor of a Pentecostal church, Kenneth Lupor Mukoro, on Sunday evening in Otu-Jeremi (Otughievwen), Ughelli South Council Area of Delta State, allegedly killed a woman. It was gathered that the deceased, Mrs. Irene Thompson Kupa, had gone to settle a dispute between the suspect and his neighbour. Sources said the incident occurred at about 6:30pm at Aruorho Quarters. The nature of the disagreement between Mukoro, a law graduate from the Delta State University (DELSU), and his neighbour could not be ascertained at press time. However, The Nation learnt that the victim, an Isoko indigene, was allegedly hit on the head with a piece of wood while trying to reconcile the duo. Kupa, who was reportedly rushed to Otu-Jeremi General Hospital before being referred to another one in Warri, died on the way to the hospital. Sources at the Ughelli Police Area Command said the suspect had been arrested by policemen from Otu-Jeremi Divisional Police Station. Police Commissioner Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke confirmed the incident. Asked if the suspect is in police custody, he said: “Let me call the command to find out.”
