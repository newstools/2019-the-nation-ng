 The wife of Niger State Governor, Dr. Amina Abubakar Sani-Bello has said punishment for perpetrators of gender-based violence should be  severe in order to curb the vice. She said: “We need our laws to be strengthened because some of the punishment for these perpetrators are very mild. We need to have a legislation that will make punishments for the perpetrators stronger and stiffer than it is now.” Dr Bello stated this in Minna while speaking to reporters after a walk against gender-based violence organised by the state Ministry of Gender Affairs, Raise Foundation and WRAPA. She said: “There is a need to look at the law and reform them so that they will serve as a deterrent for perpetrators and make them think twice before engaging in any act of gender violence.” Dr Bello urged women to report cases of gender-based violence, calling on the security, community and traditional leaders and family to come together to say no to gender and sex-based violence. The Director of Gender and Domestic Violence in the state Ministry of Justice, Mero Mohammed Man said the state government would soon domesticate the administration of the Criminal Justice law Act. She said the state is also working on exploring alternative dispute resolution in criminal matters where the perpetrators will be made to serve non-custodian sentences that will bring succour to the victims. The UNICEF Youth Advocate Team Lead in Niger, Ibrahim Nuhu Saidu said the walk against gender-based violence is a good initiative.
