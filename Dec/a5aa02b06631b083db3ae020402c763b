KWARA State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has said his administration is committed to engendering inclusive socioeconomic growth in an environment of peace and respect for all stakeholders, especially traditional institutions. “The drive for collective prosperity through enterprise and inclusive socioeconomic and infrastructural development is at the heart of our agenda as an administration,” the Governor said at the 10th coronation anniversary of the Olojoku of Ojoku Oba AbdulRasaq Adegboyega Afolabi, which was attended by crème de la crème from within and outside of the state, including Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi. “For this reason, this administration will continue to strengthen the frontiers of peace that Kwara State is known for because development cannot take place in an atmosphere of chaos or where there is threat to peace.” AbdulRazaq was represented at the event by Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs Hajia Aisha Ahman Pategi. The Governor also reiterated his administration’s respect for traditional institutions, calling them the custodians of the people’s culture and tradition and saying they “are key to our agenda to rebuild a state that works for all.” He added: “In no distant time, this administration will roll out the anti-poverty Social Investment Programme and our community leaders will be key to make it a huge success through transparency and inclusion. The next four years will, God willing, record very impactful infrastructural development in our state as part of our strategy to open up Kwara for growth and make it competitive. We have received bids for the construction or rehabilitation of 26 roads in the first phase of what promises to be a steady upgrade of our community and urban road network.” AbdulRazaq, meanwhile, has said that the administration is working hard to deepen access to qualitative education that would make the Kwara child truly competitive in the 21st century knowledge economy.
