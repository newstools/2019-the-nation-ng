Our Reporter  WRITER, director and producer, Chris Ihidero has urged actors to envision their career and work towards it. He said this at the Actor-Producer Parley hosted by PinPoint Media for 50 young actors on Wednesday. Ihidero also said that actors have to be particular about the jobs they take and how the roles fit into their career strategy. The event, which was an interactive session between Nollywood producers and 50 young actors also had in attendance; Director, Producer, Femi Ogunsanwo; Director, Producer, Emmanuel Uduma and others. During the session, these young actors shared their struggles in the industry and asked questions bordering on navigating the industry, investing in self-growth and positioning themselves. ‘Knockout Blessing’ star, Ade Laoye also gave a piece of profound advice to the young actors, saying, “Never let your talent be in question.”  Femi Ogunsanwo, who talked about work ethics with the budding actors, said: “It’s a game of referral, put in your A-game with strong work ethics and watch it move mountains.” On mentorship and relationships in the industry, Emma Uduma said: “Mentorship isn’t by force, stop sending unsolicited messages on social media without value. Do your research, read scripts, read about actors and don’t stop learning.” The event, created to connect people through conversations, also featured a film show and an afternoon of food and drinks. The Actor-Producer Parley, the first for PinPoint Media, is part of the company’s initiative to contribute towards a stronger Nollywood.
