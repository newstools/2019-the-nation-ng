At least three persons sustained injuries on Wednesday afternoon after a gas cylinder exploded at Four Point By Sheraton Hotel, Oniru in Victoria Island, Lagos. The explosion occurred at about 12:35pm while welders were at work inside the hotel premises. It was gathered that one of the cylinder hoses brought by the welders had leakage which triggered the explosion. Several vehicles in the premises, windows and other items were shattered. Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Dr. Femi Oke-Osayintolu, said recovery operation was ongoing. He said: “The situation is under control as combined efforts of the LASEMA Response Unit (LRU), Nigeria Police alongside staff of the hotel are on the ground to ensure a swift recovery. “A total of three people sustained severe injuries as a result of the blast and two have been rushed to Lagos Island General hospital for intensive care by LASEMA Ambulance Unit while one was rushed to a nearby private hospital. “A total of 10 vehicles alongside several windows of the hotel were affected by the effects of the explosion.”
