Some upcoming artistes, who performed at the Afrika Shrine Talent Discovery Night, on Thursday said they would have liked Wizkid and Davido to be present at the Talent Discovery night show. The artistes said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the Talent Discovery Night held at Afrika Shrine in Lagos. According to them, the presence of ‘A’ list artistes such as WizKid and Davido at their shows will serve as a form of encouragement. One of the artists, Tony Morgan, who sang Afro Pop music, said he was happy for getting the opportunity to perform at the event, adding that getting the right attention has always been his challenge. “I feel great to have performed on the same stage where great Fela Anikulapo Kuti once performed. “This will at least address the challenge of getting an audience to listen to me. “I would be happier if known musicians like Wzkid and Davido had been here tonight to cheer us and encourage our chosen career. “This will help me to do better as I know I have good songs, which I cannot wait to share with the people,” he said. Morgan said that if they kept getting platforms like this, graced with ‘A’ list artiste, they could soon be the next big gigs in the industry with much effort. Adebayo Koffi Sekoni with stage name ‘Daddy K’ who also performed at the event, said it had not been easy for upcoming artistes, adding that they needed support from the known artists in the industry. “If only Wizkid and Davido can take time out to organise something like this or just come and listen to us, I will feel excited performing in their presence. “We are still trying to build our confidence and having them around will go a long way in boosting our morale.” he said. Taye Adebisi, a dancer with stage name T.y, also commended the organisers for the platform and urged other professional artistes to support the idea. (NAN)
