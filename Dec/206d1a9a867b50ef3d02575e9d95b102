Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo helped 10-man Rangers to beat Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic 2-1 with goals from Ryan Kent and Nikola Katic allowing Steven Gerrard’s side to reduce the gap at the top to two points on Sunday. Aribo was given his 17th start this season for Rangers and was instrumental to Rangers’ first win at Celtic Park since 2010. Aribo featured for the entirety of the game which saw Ryan Kent opened the scoring in the Old Firm derby in the 36th minute when the unmarked winger latched on to Borna Barisic’s low cross to whip his shot home, minutes after Ryan Christie’s penalty for Celtic was saved by Allan McGregor. Odsonne Edouard levelled for Celtic eight minutes later before Nikola Katic notched the match-winning goal in the 56th minute from a header at the near post off a corrner kick. Despite Rangers losing Alfredo Morelos to a stoppage time red card, they held on to their lead to take maximum points. An elated Aribo tweeted after the game: “What A Performance! Come on You GERS!” Aribo has been tipped to become Nigeria’s best player of this generation, having impressed during his appearances for the Super Eagles since making his debut earlier this season. Born in England, the 23 year-old, who has played 32 times for Rangers, has been capped four times by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr, scoring two goals in his first two games for Nigeria.
