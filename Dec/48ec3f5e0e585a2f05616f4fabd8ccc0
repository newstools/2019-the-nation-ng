 LAGOS State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday advised Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIOs) and Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) officials to be civil in their interaction with the residents. Speaking at the inauguration of the Lagos Vehicle Inspection Service headquarters, Sanwo-Olu said that the government did not want anybody to be molested during enforcement of traffic and transport laws. He said his administration wanted civilised officers because that was what was promised Lagosians. The governor said to ensure that officers did not molest any resident; they would be equipped with handheld devices to capture vehicles that contravened the law, “so that LASTMA officials will have less physical interaction with offenders.” He added that the government did not want officers running after motorists, who contravened the law. Sanwo-Olu said that the government would build the capacity of its workforce and motivate them, urging the officers to maintain the facilities. Transport Commissioner Dr. Frederic Oladeinde said that the provision of the facility was in line with the Vehicle Inspection Service vision, which was to serve the people by delivering efficient and automated service that would ensure a safer transportation system that met global best practices. He said: “This administration, in ensuring safety of lives and property, has introduced the Lagos Computerised Vehicle Inspection Services (LACVIS) to ensure proper vehicular documentation and also Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) for data analysis of traffic law offences. “The use of ANPR in enforcing vehicle documentation has reduced the heavy presence of Vehicle Inspection Service officers on the road, thereby eliminating traffic congestion caused by the presence of the officers on the roads during their routine checks.”
