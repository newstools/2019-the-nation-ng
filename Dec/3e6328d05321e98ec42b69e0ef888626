Former Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo says he is not worried for being dropped from the final three-man shortlist for the 2019 African Footballer of the Year award. The 30-year-old, who finished as the highest goal scorer at the 2019 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), initially made the 10-man shortlist released by CAF on December 10 but was missing when the list was pruned down to three last Sunday. This leaves Senegal’s Sadio Mane, who plays for Liverpool, his club mate Egypt’s Mohamed Salah and Manchester City’s Algeria forward Riyad Mahrez to compete for the award to be decided on January 7, 2020 at the Albatros Citadel Sahl Hasheesh, Hurghada, Egypt. In a chat with NationSport, the Shanghai Shenhua of China forward said he was even delighted to be the only Nigerian to make the top 10 shortlist. “Firstly I am very grateful to God for my name to be among the best 10 players in Africa. That alone is a privilege because two to three years ago, if somebody said I am going to be among the 10 best players, I will doubt it.
“I am happy that my name was there in the first place. But unfortunately it is not on the last three. So I wish those that are there all the best of luck. Anyone that wins it, good luck to the person,” he told NationSport.
