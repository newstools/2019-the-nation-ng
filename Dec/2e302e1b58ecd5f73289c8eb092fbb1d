 The Konshisha Local Government Traditional Council in Benue State has banished two men, Mbashinya Abata and Terna Ikyondu, for allegedly killing two girls through witchcraft. The victims, Mbasen and Mbawuese, were mysteriously drowned in River Agberagba last week. The Nation gathered that after the bodies were recovered from the river, youths mobilised and apprehended the suspects. They confessed to killing the girls inside the river. The suspects were almost killed by a mob, but for the intervention of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Fidelis Jombo, who led a police team to rescue them. It was learnt that the traditional ruler of Konsshisha (Ter Ikyor), Chief Jam Gbiinde, and his council-in-chief had banished the suspects from the community. He said such action would not be tolerated in his community and warned his subjects against witchcraft practice.
