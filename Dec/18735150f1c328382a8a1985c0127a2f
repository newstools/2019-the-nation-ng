 The police in Ogun State have arrested three alleged members of a syndicate said to specialise in vandalising telecommunications masts in the Ibafo area of the state. The suspects Adeola Oyesanya, Bashiru Mohammed and Musa Mohammed were arrested following a tip-off by a security guard attached to an MTN mast in Papa Ibafo. The gurad told the police that thieves stormed the site, vandalised the mast and carted away 12 batteries valued at N1.8 million. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said on Sunday that the Divisional Police Officer, Ibafo Division, Abiodun Ayinde, acting upon the information, mobilised anti-robbery men to the scene. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said that when the suspects sighted the policemen, they abandoned the items looted and ran into the  bushes. DSP Oyeyemi said the police cordoned off  the area and combed the bushes which led to the arrest of Adeola Oyesanya. Oyesanya’s arrest reportedly led to the apprehension of two others, who were alleged to be receivers of stolen goods. According to Abimbola, the three in their confessions during interrogation, admitted committing the alleged crime, saying they had been in the business for quite some time. The suspects would be transfered to the state criminal investigation and intelligence department on the directive of the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, for further investigation and prosecution.
