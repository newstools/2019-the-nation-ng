By Sampson Unamka  Nigerian London-based satirist, Mazi Abe Idris of the Mazi & Friends fame is set to hold a show titled “A Christmas Evening with Mazi & Friends” scheduled for December 29, 2019 at Muri Okunola Hall, Victoria Island, Lagos. Announcing the show, Mazi Abe said therapy is one of the aims of the interactive show because, as Petra Onyegbule, a member of the team said, “laughter is medicine.” Other aims are to support the physically challenged in society and up-coming artists. The show which will start 5pm till 11pm will feature the Afrobeat Maestro, Dede Mabiaku alongside other musicians and comedians.  Mazi Abe who is essentially a writer, describes himself as a story teller whose art borders on humor and comedy. “I write about myself and about the adventures of my life,” he said. Abe also describes his language of communication as Nigerian English, not pidgin. Through these stories, he has warmed his way into the hearts of many people, especially on social media where he is followed by more than 13, 000 fans. Mazi Abe who says he is a Felaist (a believer in the philosophy and ideas of Fela Anikulapo) has lived in London for 30 years where he conceptualized and began Mazi & Friends before bringing it down to Nigeria.
