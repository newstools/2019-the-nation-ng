 The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has appealed to the federal government to provide the right atmosphere for farm produce to be appropriately priced. The Osun State Coordinator for NDE, Mr. Ismail Yekeen, who made the appeal at the orientation and flag off ceremony on Sustainable Agricultural Development Training Scheme (SADTS 2019) for unemployed youths in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, said doing so will help reduce poverty among farmers. Yekeen said poverty would prevail among farmers as long as prices and sales of farm produce are subject to market forces. He disclosed that the objectives of the NDE SADTS, among others, are to enhance food production, provide more profitable farm income, enhance quality of life for farm families, communities and provide mass employment. According to him, the NDE is set to train thousands of unemployed school leavers and graduates of tertiary institutions, who have passion for agriculture as an enterprise, on crop and livestock farming. He directed the concerned NDE state offices to ensure that the shortlisted participants are exposed to various aspects of modern agricultural production during the four-month training programme.
