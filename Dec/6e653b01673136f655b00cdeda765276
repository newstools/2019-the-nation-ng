From Frank Ikpefan, Abuja  The Association of Telephone, Cable TV and Internet Subscribers of Nigeria, have backed the directive of Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, compelling the telecommunications service providers to reduce the prices of data being offered to subscribers. The union noted that service providers have gradually metamorphosed to perpetual milking of Nigerians that use their services in diverse ways. In a statement by ATCIS National President, Sina Bilesanmi in Abuja, he noted that Nigerians pay high fees for inefficiencies, ungraded facilities and systematic dilapidation of services by these telecoms service providers “that often times necessitated epileptic service provision that makes smooth communications and usage impossible.”
