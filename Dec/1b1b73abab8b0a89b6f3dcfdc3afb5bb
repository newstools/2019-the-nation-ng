 Nigerian heavyweight boxer, Efe Ajagba has declared that nothing will save Lago Kiladze from getting knocked out tomorrow at the Toyota Arena, Ontario, California. Undefeated “The One and Only” Ajagba will enter the ring for the 12th time with strong hope of another victory, which would help him consolidate his march towards the world heavyweight title. The 10 round affair is an under card action for the World Boxing Council (WBC) World Super Welter Title between contender Tony Harris and Ajagba’s training partner Jermell Charlo. The Nigerian withdrew from his last bout against Congo-born Belgian, Jack Mulowayi in October due to a back injury and won his last fight against Ali Eren Demirezen of Turkey by unanimous points’ decision in July. “I am very ready for this fight. I pulled out of my last bout because of a back injury and before then I defeated Demirezen through unanimous decision but this time, it will be a knockout out,” Ajagba said. “He is a good boxer if you look at his record. He started very well and he is definitely more experienced than I am but I am more determined. He has not won in his last four fights and I want to ensure I add another loss to his record.” Ajagba made the headlines all over the world last year when his opponent, Curtis Harper, walked out of the fight after touching gloves and the bell sounded to start the opening round, making it the shortest fight on record. He was Nigeria’s sole representative at the Rio Olympics boxing event in 2016 where he lost to Ivan Dychko in the quarterfinals. Georgia’s Kiladze, 33, is a former World Boxing Association (WBA) Inter-Continental cruiserweight champion and has lost four of his professional fights and has not won any of his last four fights going into his clash, but he has a strong scorecard of 26 wins, 18 via knockouts.
