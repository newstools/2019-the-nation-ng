The Executive Director, Poly Products, Lagos, Pavan Gwalani yesterday said Lagos State needed about 5,000 mobile toilets to eliminate the menace of open defecation. Gwalani, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Lagos said: “With a population of almost 20 million people, 5,000 mobile toilets should serve about 40 people daily.” He, however, urged stricter sanctions, which he said, would reduce the menace of open defecation which noted had become an eyesore to the public. Gwalani urged companies  to adopt provision of mobile toilets as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) to the state. He advised siting a pilot scheme at locations with greater concentration of people to properly project the effectiveness and efficiency of the mobile toilets with regards to cleanliness and maintenance. Speaking about the choice of plastics, Gwalani said it was preferred for its mobility, portability and the recyclable advantage. “This is not bad and can be be increased with time after a pilot scheme is carried out to gauge its effectiveness. “Companies must also try to do something beneficial for the economy they are trying to benefit from,” he said.
