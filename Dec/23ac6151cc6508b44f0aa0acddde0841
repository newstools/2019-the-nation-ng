Damisi Ojo,Akure A senator representing Ondo South Senatorial District,Nicholas Tofowomo on Saturday condemned the re-arrest of Omoyele Sowore by the personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS) inside the courtroom on Friday where Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu was presiding. He noted that the manner in which the court and her premises was overrun by men of the DSS to re-arrest Sowore and Bakare over alleged fresh charges, was a gross transgression on constitutionalism and a profane of the hallowed courtroom. Tofowomo in a statement by his Special Assistant (SA) on Media,Olumide Akinrinlola urged the DSS officials to act professionally within the confine of the law,stressing that they should allow the court to try Sowore and his co – defendant over allegations they leveled against them. His words” The DSS should be more interested in proving the allegations they leveled against both of them. Whatever fresh charges could have been included through a mere application for amendment of their charge sheet before the court. ” Sowore is my constituent from Kiribo community and as much as I know, he is not a terrorist and does not have any criminal record in the past. The invasion of the courtroom to re-arrest him was unnecessary. ” I appeal to men of the DSS to change their approach to remove their reproach, especially while carrying out their official duties in any case, because power transcends from one political dispensation to the other. The lawmaker urged the DSS, to urgently release Sowore,stressing that their actions and inactions would determine what their tomorrow will be.
