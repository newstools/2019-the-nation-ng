TWO soccer coaches from leading universities in United States of America will arrive in Lagos this month, with offers of all-expense paid trips abroad and scholarships to a number of talented secondary school students to attend tertiary institutions through a free of charge three-day talent hunt programme billed to hold this month. The coaches will run a three-day talent hunt programme at First Bank Field, Satellite Town, Lagos from December 20 to 22 under the aegis of USA-based Angels of The World (AOTW), as non-governmental organization that has former FC Ebedei of Sagamu striker, Michael David (Omasaro) among its directors. David said the programme, tagged First College Showcase In Nigeria, will accord four to six young footballers opportunities to exhibit their passion for soccer and education under the watchful eyes of the visiting American university coaches. The excellent ones among the lot across three days will eventually be granted opportunities to attend University of California Santa Barbara, USA fully-paid athletic scholarship, which the AOTW co-founder, who was born in Nigeria and grew up playing football on the streets of Lagos, said will hopefully bring about the discovery of the countryâ€™s next super-star.
