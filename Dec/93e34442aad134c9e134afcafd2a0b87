Juventus veteran Mario Mandzukic, who had been Manchester United target for a while now, has snubbed The Red Devils and joined a club at the Qatar League. Mandzukic, who has shocked several top-flight clubs in Europe by joining Al-Duhail, had regularly been linked with Old Trafford, especially after Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri ignored him all this season. However, it was understood earlier Man United’s interest had begun to fade away last month, which could have been the main reason why the Croatian chose to move to the Middle East and pick a big final payday. The recent reports have suggested that Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is chasing Red Bull Salzburg forward Erling Haaland. The former Premier League champions are not the only club after the young Norwegian striker as they have competition from clubs like Juventus. A few Italian media firms are reporting that Juventus are favourites to defeat Man Utd in the $33m race to sign Haaland ahead of the January transfer window. If Man Utd manage to sign Salzburg forward, the 19-year-old’s salary will go from his current $26,000 a week to a massive $259,000-per-week deal.
