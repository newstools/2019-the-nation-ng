 THE Lagos State Government has commenced mass administration of drugs to control and also eradicate Schistomiasis (Snail Fever) in seven Local Government Areas where the disease has become endemic. The Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, who disclosed this to newsmen during a press briefing at the weekend, explained that the state has flagged off mass medical intervention activities and awareness campaigns to stem the tide of the disease in the state. He listed the local government areas as Ikeja, Ifako-Ijaiye, Amuwo-Odofin, Oshodi-Isolo, Agege, Lagos Mainland and Alimosho. For maximum result, Abayomi said health workers will go round schools, homes and other important places to administer on children between ages 5 and 14, beginning from Monday 2nd to Sunday 8th December. He, therefore, advised parents and guardians to ensure their children and wards eat well before taking the drugs. The Commissioner explained that the administration of medicines for control of the disease during the weeklong campaign would be carried out by the state government in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation (WHO) and Mission to Save the Helpless (MITOSATH). Explaining the cause and mode of transmission of the disease, he said Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever and bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes and acquired when people come into contact with fresh-water infested with the larval forms of flatworms.
