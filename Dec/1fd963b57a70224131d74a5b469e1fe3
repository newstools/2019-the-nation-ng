 THE Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria (CIOTA) has revealed that plans are underway to tackle traffic situation on Nigerian roads, including around the seaport. The plan will be anchored on deploying volunteer groups majorly made up of members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Speaking in Abuja on Tuesday during the maiden National Transportation Summit which had as its theme, “Unlocking the Potentials of Transportation for Sustainable Development”, President of CIOTA, Bashir Jamoh, declared that it was time to restructure the rickety means of transportation that the nation currently has. According to Jamoh, “It is time to reorientate the touting that occurs at our motor parks all in the name of Transportation. According to Jamoh, CIoTA’s first objective will be to interface with the Head of Service and the Ministry of Education to ensure that transportation is truly professionalised in the country. This is by ensuring that there are people that can reinvigorate, re-design, and rebuild Transportation system in Nigeria. “The second focus of CIOTA has to do with volunteer groups. We admit that Nigerians are suffering anytime they use the roads due to reasons like traffic congestion, bad state of the road among others. For over two to three months, the Presidential Committee on the Apapa gridlock has worked tirelessly on the traffic situation in and around the ports, without much success. Therefore, CIoTA is going to be part and parcel of the effort to resolve the hydra-headed monster called Apapa gridlock. After vigorous research, CIoTA has come up with what we call a volunteer group to bring an end to Apapa gridlock.
