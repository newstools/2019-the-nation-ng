DESPITE taking the lead, injury-ravaged Enugu Rangers got off to a losing start in the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup today when they fell 3-1 to Pyramid FC of Egypt. Birthday boy Ibrahim Olawoyin put home team Rangers in front in the 29th minute with a superb strike. However, Pyramid FC drew level on 55 minutes from the penalty spot through Mohamed Farouk after Isiaka Oladuntoye handled the ball inside the box. Rangers were reduced to 10 men in half time stoppage time, when captain Tope Olusesi received his second booking of the day. The Egyptian cup holders then netted two late goals to record maximum three points on the road. Islam Attia gave the visitors the lead after 86 minutes, before Amor Layouni wrapped up the victory for Pyramid in the 89th minute from the penalty spot.
