MANY governors are facing anxious moments over the sum of N649.43 billion allegedly paid by the Federal Government to states as the final tranche of the Paris Club loan refunds. Paris Club refunds are the longstanding claims resulting from reported over-deductions regarding Paris Club debts made from state government accounts between 1995 and 2002. Rather than pay the said sum into the account of each state government like it had done with monthly allocations, the Federal Government decided this time to pay it into the account of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum. But the palms of many governors are believed to have been greased with the money, prompting the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to start a move towards bringing the errant governors to book. Some leading lights of the 8th Senate may also be invited to say what they knew about the sleaze. A reliable source in EFCC said the anti-graft agency will move against the culprits “very soon,” adding that the disclosures that will be made from the sordid deeds will shock Nigerians. To forestall this, some governors across the political divide have vowed to ensure that the EFCC boss is not confirmed as the substantive chair of the commission.
