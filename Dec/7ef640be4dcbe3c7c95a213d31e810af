 LAGOS State Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has been commended for proposing to extend amnesty to perpetrators of all kind of crimes in the state ranging from robbery, kidnapping, cultism and general banditry. Lagos Peace Movement (LGM) Coordinator Comrade Adekunle Adeosun described the development as the right step in the right direction. The step, he said, would further secure the state and its residents. Adeosun, therefore, appealed to those concerned to seize the opportunity of the governor’s good gesture to reintegrate themselves back to society as decent and civilize citizens. He reminded that every community has its own peculiarity as far as criminality is concerned pointing out that, “some of those communities have extended hands of amnesty to their once upon a time dissidents and thereby absorbing them back to the communities after submitting their instruments of crimes.” He urged all the suspected kidnappers, armed robbers, buglers, serial killers, rapists, pickpockets and cultists to repent and surrender their weapons of destruction so as to benefit from the largesse that Sanwo-Olu extends to them in form rehabilitation programmes. Adeosun praised Governor Sanwo-Olu over the initiative saying, “with that also in place, Lagos State would be more secure and become more conducive for business through which the  Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) would shore up.”
