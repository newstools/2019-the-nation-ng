 DESPITE not having enough playing time this season with Leicester in the English Premier League, Kelechi Iheanacho has said that he still believes he possess the quality that saw him banging goals while playing for Manchester City before joining the Foxes. Also, Aston Villa are reportedly interested in signing the Super Eagles striker on loan in the January transfer window. Iheanacho, a surprise match-winner for Leicester against Everton admitted that he is happy to play second fiddle to star striker Jamie Vardy. According to LeicesterShire Live, the Nigerian frontman produced an outstanding performance from the substitutes’ bench in Sunday’s 2-1 victory over Everton, setting up Vardy’s equaliser before coolly bending in the winner in the 94th minute. The £25m man has featured in the Carabao Cup, Sunday’s clash was his first Premier League appearance of the season. But he says he has not been frustrated and is content to be Vardy’s back-up. “As a football player you need to keep your head and keep going and concentrate when you are playing and when you are not playing,” he said. “Everyone has to go through this at some point. You need to keep working hard and believing in yourself that one day you can get your chance. I am confident. I believe in myself if I get the chance. “It happens in football sometimes you can face trying times or sometimes you can play. It is a time I have to face in my life and just have to keep going.
