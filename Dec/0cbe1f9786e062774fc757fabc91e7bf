By Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi  The Vice-Chancellor of the Christian University of Mkar, Mkar, Prof. Iorwuese Gernah, has called on the National Assembly to amend TETFund Act to accommodate private universities. Gernah made the appeal during a press conference to announce activities for the 4th combined convocation of the University located in Benue State. The University of Mkar is based in Gboko Local Government Area and funded by NKST church worldwide. The Vice-Chancellor said the need to amend TEFund Act became imperative because at the time the law was enacted there were no private universities in the country. On the controversy surrounding IPPIS, Gernah said that Nigerian University needed one another to achieve academic excellence using the available manpower and the introduction of IPPIS would place hardship on small universities like UMM that are funded through levies from church coffers.  During the convocation, Gemah said 22 students would graduate with first class in various degrees, out of the 1, 177 undergraduates and 59 post graduate degree holders. He stressed further that the biggest challenge of the university was infrastructural development and funding. The VC called on the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom and others to support the university, especially in the construction of the two main roads leading to institution which he said were in dilapidated condition. During the convocation, The vice Chancellor said senator Barnabas Gemade would be installed as the chancellor of the University, while Honorary degrees would be conferred on three prominent Nigerians.
