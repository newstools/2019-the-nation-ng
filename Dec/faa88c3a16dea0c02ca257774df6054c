 IN fulfillment of its promise to kick-off massive construction after the rains, the Lagos State Government has commenced the dredging of major drainage channels and canals spread across the state. Among the drainage channels where contractors have moved to site and commenced dredging are the Jankara/ Oroyinyin/ Binuyo/ Adeniji Adele channel, the System 6c made up of Idioro-Idiaraba axis, Ado soba Channel at Festac and the dredging of the Gbagada- Bariga Channel. Others, where work has started, are the Kentucky- Alapere, Irede Satellite Channels in the Ojo axis and the Construction of trapezoidal Drainage at the downstream of Ekoro in Aboru. Delving more into the projects when he led State officials on an inspection of some of the dredging points, the Special Adviser on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe stated that the dredging of the channels will put the state in good stead to prevent flooding of several prone areas. Speaking to reporters after the inspection, Igbokwe said the government was taking advantage of the easing off of rainfall to immediately commence dredging and minimise the dangers of flooding. The Special Adviser who was accompanied by the Permanent Secretary, Drainage services, Lekan Shodeinde and other directors warned all those who had erected structures on the setbacks and alignments of the channels being dredged and others, to remove them or have them removed and also face prosecution.
