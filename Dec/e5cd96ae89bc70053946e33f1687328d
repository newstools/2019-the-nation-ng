Chelsea’s transfer ban has been lifted by the court of arbitration for sport, which means the blues can make signings in January. The Blues were given a two-window punishment by Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA for breaches of the rules regarding their dealings with players under the age of 18, which covered last summer which they served and was due to take in next month, too. That has now been cancelled. Chelsea’s appeal to Fifa failed but they have enjoyed stunning success with Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS, which announced its decision on Friday morning. Fifa had investigated the London team for rule breaches in relation to 150 players, with the most serious concerning transgressions of its article 19. It emerged in February that the governing body had charged them with 92 breaches of this article and found them guilty in 29 cases. The club were also found by Fifa to have broken other rules, including one that concerned third-party influence. After the club’s transfer ban was lifted the team manager Frank Lampard says he’s ready to spend big in January. He warned the club’s promising young stars they will have to fight for their places in the first team – just like he did when Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. He said: “As we go forward of course if I feel there are positions we can strengthen then we will obviously look at that, as all big clubs do. “That’s why people expected less of us this season because lots of clubs around us and below us were spending £100million and we didn’t have that chance, and we lost Hazard and two number nines. “Now the pictures slightly changed and it’s important that we get it right moving forward.”
