BADAGARY town in Lagos State was agog at the weekend, as residents and indigenes gathered for the celebration of the annual Black Heritage Festival. Addressing the participants, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu on Arts and Culture, Solomon Saanu Bonu, said the celebration was in fulfillment of the mandate embedded in the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda towards the development of tourism and economic empowerment for Lagosians. He added that the event was also to encourage the preservation and promotion of Badagary’s cultural heritage. “One unique thing about the Badagary Heritage Festival is that this will be the first time Badagary division will be coming out in this form to project the peculiarities of communities of the local governments and local council development areas. This connotes the unity of purpose we have clamoured for as a division. It is unique as we hope it will attract more international tourism investors to the area,” Bonu said. He said the festival sends a signal to Badagary residents about the disposition of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his passion for the area aimed at promoting unity and progress. Noting that the celebration shows how focused and committed the governor is to the state’s vision for continuity and a greater Lagos, the special adviser enjoined participants to support the government to give the tourism potentials in Badagary the needed impetus and attention. He thanked Governor Sanwo-Olu for granting approval for the hosting of the festival and expressed profound gratitude to the council chairmen in Badagary division for their cooperation, responsiveness and support for the present administration.
