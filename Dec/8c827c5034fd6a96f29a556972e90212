The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) observed that the major reform needed in the Nigerian political environment is the reorientation of the leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who states this Monday evening in an exclusive message to The Nation in Abuja, was reacting to an allegation by the National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had connived with the APC to rig elections. The PDP National Chairman had also threatened to boycott future elections if the INEC would not ensure there are electoral reforms preceding future elections in the country. But reacting to Prince Secondus’ allegations and call for reform, Issa-Onilu said the PDP still suffers from the new way of political direction in the country, in which manipulation of electoral processes and the use of brute force no longer have a place. He, however, admonished the main opposition party to rebrand itself to conform to new ways, forge a new political ideology and direction, noting that Nigerians will continue to reject the party until it finds a new identity and do away with its alleged “underhand way of doing things. “The most important reform before the leadership of PDP is to change their ways. By now they should have realized that their old underhand political methods no longer work. PDP should adjust to the reality of an emerging political environment where manipulation, intimidation, and brigandage are becoming unhelpful to any political party. “While at it, they should remember to find a political direction with clear and purposeful ideology that can benefit our country. Until they achieve this, no amount of electoral reform can cure PDP of its malady. Nigerians would continue to reject them until they do away with their odious ways,” Issa-Onilu said.
