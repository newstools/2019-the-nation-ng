Madam Felicia Onyeneyin, aged 83 is dead. Oyeneyin passed on in Lagos in the early hours of Friday, November 29, 2019. She was a trader who was loved by not only her immediate family, but also all people who came across her. Together with her husband in Isale Eko area of Lagos State, her residence around the popular Ondo Motor Park in that area was the home for all, especially Ondo indigenes who came the way of her family. Akeem Oyeneyin, her son and founder of Visible Value Chain Limited, recalled: “This situation (of having her house around Ondo Motor Park) meant my mother welcomed visitors into her home, sometimes having to cook food for her guests who had been on the road for upwards of 12 hours, until the wee hours. It was such that either on their inbound or the  outbound  journey, Ondo indigenes using the  motor  park found a comfort zone in Mr and Mrs Oyeneyin’s one-room apartment.” Funeral rites will be announced by the family later.
