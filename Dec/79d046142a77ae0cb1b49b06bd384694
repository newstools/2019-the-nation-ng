To guard against hemorrhage, which is the leading cause of maternal and child mortality, the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has restated the commitment of the state government to the provision of safe and fast availability of blood for transfusion in all health facilities. Abayomi, who said this on Wednesday at the 2019 Annual Stakeholders’ Summit of the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service (LSBTS), noted that the resolve of the present administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure access to screened, certified,and quality blood for citizens, especially pregnant women whenever required, is unshaken. Speaking on the theme: “Strategy for Reducing Maternal Mortality: Increasing the Blood Supply”, the Commissioner declared that preventable deaths in women and children resulting from normal life procreation process caused by hemorrhage have become unacceptable. “In a place like Lagos where we have two teaching hospitals, 27 general hospitals and over 300 primary healthcare centres, we should not accept these preventable deaths. Lagos State shouldn’t be a place where we should be talking about maternal and child mortality rates and this is why we have declared zero tolerance for preventable deaths in mothers and babies,” he said.
