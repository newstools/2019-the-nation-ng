The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has appealed to youths to stay off crimes, but defend their rights for the development of the nation. The commission made the appeal on Tuesday in Lagos as Nigeria joins the rest of the world to mark the 2019 International Day for Human Rights. NHRC’s Southwest Commander Lucas Koyejo told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)o that many youths were into various crimes. He urged them to be more active and vocal in promoting whatever concerns the nation saying that no one would step down for them to occupy leadership. The commander speaking on the theme of this year said that the UN picked it to draw the attention of the youth to their responsibilities and the need for others to support them. NAN reports that the UN had set aside Dec.10 of every year as the International Day for Human Rights. This year’s theme is: Youth Standing Up for Human Rights. Koyejo said: “The UN knows that the youth are the future leaders of the world. Unfortunately, some youths in present day Nigeria are not as proactive as youths of old. “A lot of our youths are not interested in their rights or government policies that will affect their future. “The youth need to be interested in governance. That is the difference. Nobody will be discriminated against, because the future belongs to them. “They must stand up for their rights,” he said. Also, a human rights lawyer and a Civil Society leader, Mr Malachy Ugwummadu, spoke on the role of the youth in promoting human rights and peace.
