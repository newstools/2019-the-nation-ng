Umoette harped on excellence in learning and character, saying anyone found wanting in either the aforementioned is not deserving of the institution’s certificate. Educating new students on the activities in the Department of Mass Communication, Prof Mboho… advised them to participate in the department’s academic exercises, adding that punctuality to lectures and practical classes form part of requirements that qualified students to write examination. He emphasised 75 per cent attendance of lectures.  Dr. Ekpo of the Department of Economics, advised new students to work closely with lecturers, saying anyone who failed to do so had started planning to fail.

They urged the students to always show respect towards lecturers. They advised them never to allow extra-curricular activities derail their purpose in the university.
