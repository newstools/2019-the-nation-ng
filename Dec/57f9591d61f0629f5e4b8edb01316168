The kidnapped Catholic priest, Rev Fr Samuel Agwameseh, has been freed by his abductors, Delta Police Commissioner, Adeyinka Adeleke has said. The victim who is the parish priest of St Lawrence Catholic Church, Issele-Mkpitime, in the Aniocha North L.G.A, regained freedom Monday night. The cleric was kidnapped on Saturday by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen while returning from Onicha-Olona Community, where he had gone for the production of the church’s weekly bulletin. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of N20m to free the priest. Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, who confirmed the release of the priest, said he was unaware of the payment of ransom. His words, “The priest was released last night (Monday), but I’m not aware if ransom was paid or no.” It will be recalled that Reverend Father Charles Uganwa, Director of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku had appealed to the kidnappers to release the priest, insisting that it is not the policy of the church to pay ransom.
