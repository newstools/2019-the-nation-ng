 LAGOS State governor’s wife, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has hosted children at a special Christmas and end of the year party. Speaking at the event held at The Parliament, State House, Marina, she said it was important for children to know the history of Nigeria as well as the THEMES agenda of the state government designed to engender a greater Lagos. Mrs. Sanwo-Olu said: “This is 2019 children end of year party for our children in Lagos State. We decided this year that we should have it in the House of Parliament. This place has been here for a long time. “You see, way back we had the Whites that were ruling Nigeria then; we had people like Lord Lugard, if you have studied history, you would have heard that name. They used to live here and take decisions for the whole of Nigeria, not just Lagos. So, we want you to be part of the history too; we want you to know your history very well and at the same time we want you to enjoy your party.” She said in the spirit of Christmas, it was important for people, including children, to show love to others and be thankful to God for His grace and benevolence. “Christmas is a period when we share love; when we remember our loved ones; when we remember people that are not as blessed as us; people that have special qualities that are VIPs in their own right. “So we want to thank God for the opportunity of being alive today. We started this year since January through to December. It can only be God that made it possible for all of us to be alive from the beginning of the year up to this moment and beyond.”
