Adkan Group known for corporate charity has, in the spirit of Christmas, opened a hospital that will offer affordable services to tackle maternal and child mortality cases in the Northcentral region of the country. The group’s Healthcare Administrator, Sonu Kumar, said the facility, known as Mayfield Specialist Hospital, focused on ensuring that indigent women received world class antenatal and postnatal care, among other services. Kumar, while unveiling the facility on Monday in Abuja, noted that there was so much suffering in the land. He, however, maintained that the motivation behind the health facility was altruistic, saying: “We have established a new facility centre for world class maternity care. The cost of service is affordable to the Nigerian masses. “The hospital was built as a give back to the society; it is not profit-oriented, to help our country with affordable health. “We will continue to provide and extend the best international standards of quality care to our people.” He called on wealthy individuals in the country to avail themselves of the medical facilities at Mayfield, rather than flying abroad in search of remedies to their health challenges. “The hospital also features multi-specialty and super-specialty departments for advanced medical care,” he said.
