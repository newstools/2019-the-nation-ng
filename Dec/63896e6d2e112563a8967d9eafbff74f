 THE Social Integrity Network (SINET) has lauded the Godwin Emefiele-led Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for supporting the sustenance of the ongoing land border closure meant to reposition the economy. SINET National Coordinator, Ibrahim Issa, said the Federal Government should sustain the land border closure in order to fully achieve the desired benefits. Issa faulted proponents of border re-opening insisting that “the unity, growth and development of Nigeria remained sacrosanct beyond any individual gains aimed at subjecting us to slavery and perpetually underdeveloped.” SINET noted “that the gains of the policy are numerous to mention but specifically, its impact on the socio-economic and security is unprecedented and Manufacturers are now able to sell  goods in their warehouses. “As a group representing over 700,000 Nigerians who are majorly employees in the public and private sectors respectively, Emefiele’s position will help tackle smuggling and importation of substandard commodities. “We are in total support of the position of all the stakeholders/investors who want the border closure to continue. They have demonstrated high degree of trust and love for Nigeria as a nation and by extension to the entire citizenry who are victims of the insurgency especially in the northeast. Also, more jobs would be created, collapsed industries are in the revival process while many new industries would spring up.” The group further added that, “As the giant of Africa, it is an absurd for developed nations to build warehouses in our neighboring countries and paying them heavily for goods to be dumped therein and smuggled into our country with little or no returns to our nation.
