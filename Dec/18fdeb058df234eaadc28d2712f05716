Premier League club Crystal Palace, Borussia Monchengladbach from the German Bundesliga as well as La Liga outfit Real Betis are the latest clubs to show interest in Club Brugge forward Emmanuel Dennis. Palace, Betis and Borussia Monchengladbach have made bids for the 22-year-old Nigeria star, according to Foot Mercato. The question now is whether Club Brugge will let him go as early as next month as they are very much in the UEFA Europa League and also on track for another Belgian championship in three seasons. Dennis heroics in the UEFA Champions League at Real Madrid have attracted more suitors after Premier League clubs Manchester United and Arsenal were also linked to him.
