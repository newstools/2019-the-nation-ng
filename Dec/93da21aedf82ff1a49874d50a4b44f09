Their supporters draw blood. Regularly. Machetes are used. Guns even boom. From Kogi to Bayelsa and other states in the country, All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members go for one another’s jugular. It is always a fight to the finish. But twice this year, APC and PDP chairmen, Adams Oshiomhole, and Uche Secondus, have met at public functions and greeted like two friends who had not seen one another for some time. They posed for photo journalists to click away. The first time was during the legal tussle at the Supreme Court between former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and President Muhammadu Buhari. On Tuesday, Oshiomhole and Secondus met again at the presentation of the book written by The Sun former Managing Director Eric Osagie. They hugged and smiled. They joked and exchanged the ‘high five’ the message in their composure seems to be: no to politics of bitterness. Will their supporters heed or will they continue to draw blood?
