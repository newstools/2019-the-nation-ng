One-time vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abuabakar, has been fighting several battles in recent times. His desire to displace President Muhammadu Buhari as the number one citizen of the country and the death of his close aide, Umar Pariya, lead the list. During the week, Atiku returned to Nigeria after spending about seven months in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This was well deserved considering the stress that came with the presidential election. Though things have not worked in his favour lately, the appointment of his son, Adamu Atiku, as the Commissioner for Works and Energy Development in Adamawa, will give him some reason to smile. Adamu was among the 23 newly inaugurated commissioners by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa. The inauguration ceremony was held on Monday.
