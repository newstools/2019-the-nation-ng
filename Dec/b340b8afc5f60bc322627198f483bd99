Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has urged Federal Government to sustain its current border closure. The association said it would boost the economy. Its chairman in Niger State, Alhaji Idris Abini, spoke in Minna, the state capital, in an interview yesterday with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Abini noted that the closure had increased rice production in the state due to increased demand by marketers and consumers. “Although we are yet to meet local demand for rice, we have started the journey to produce more rice due to the closure of our borders because efforts will be made by both government and farmers to produce enough food. “The border closure is a right step in the right direction because it is already increasing wealth among farmers as consumers are beginning to patronise our local rice,” he said. Abini said Nigeria has different varieties of rice that can compete favourably with foreign brands. The RIFAN chairman stressed that the closure would ensure security in the country as smuggling of illegal arms and ammunition would be curtailed. “Those criticising the closure of the borders are not a true Nigerians because it is one of the best decisions of this administration,” he said. Abini expressed optimism that the policy would succeed as government was providing the enabling environment for agriculture to thrive by supporting farmers with inputs and implements. “The Federal Government has demonstrated this through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anchor Borrowers Scheme by allowing farmers to access more loans even when previous ones have not been fully repaid,” he said.
