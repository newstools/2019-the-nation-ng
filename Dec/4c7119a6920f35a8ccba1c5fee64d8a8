 A 40-year-old civil servant, Alani Taofeeq, at the weekend appeared at an Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court in Ogun State for allegedly defrauding three men of N275,000 on the pretext of helping them to buy motorcycles. Taofeeq, who lives at 12, Soluade Street, Ijeun Tuntun, Abeokuta, is facing a two-count charge of fraud and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Olu-balogun Lawrence alleged that the defendant committed the offences on January 4, at about 8pm, at One Aregbe in Abeokuta. He alleged that the defendant collected N105,000 from Mr. Ogunjobi Rasaq on the pretext that he would help him buy two motorcycles from the Ogun State Ministry of Forestry. The prosecutor said the defendant had claimed that the ministry was auctioning some goods. He alleged that the defendant also collected N45,000 from Mr. Abdullahi Jubril and N125,000 from Mr. Ogun Mukailia on the false pretences that he would help them buy two motorcycles. Olu-balogun said that the defendant had told his victims that the purchase would be through auction sales from his office where he was working as a driver. He said the defendant converted the money to his use, adding that efforts by the complainants to get the motorcycles or retrieve their money proved abortive. He said that Taofeeq was arrested and handed over to the police. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened sections 419 and 319 of the Criminal Laws of Ogun, 2006. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Mr. Olakunleyin Oke granted him N250,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties must be employed and provide evidence of tax payment to the government. The case was adjourned till January 8.
