Former Super Eagles skipper and founder of Kanu Heart Foundation (KHF),  Nwankwo Kanu, says the foundation has saved 565 indigent children following successful open heart surgeries in the last 20 years. Kanu made the disclosure when KHF officials visited the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Owerri to celebrate Christmas with patients in the hospital, stating that about 200 ailing children were currently on the waiting list for surgeries. “Kanu Heart Foundation was established in 2000, so far so good for us,” the former Arsenal forward stated. “We have done 565 open heart surgeries since the foundation came on board and these are mainly the less privileged children but we have 200 patients on the waiting list. “In the last three years, we have been going to hospitals to celebrate Christmas with patients in hospitals across the country. We decided to do this year’s own in the South East with Abia and Imo the main targets.” The Atlanta 1996 Olympic hero, however, lamented increase in heart-related diseases, noting most sufferers knew little or nothing about the symptoms. Kanu said the foundation was working towards building a hospital in the country because of the huge logistics including transportation, surgery and rehabilitation of victims.
