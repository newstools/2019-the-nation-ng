 THE 2020 budget of Ogun State was prepared to block leakages and systemic corruption within the civil bureaucracy and governance process, Governor Dapo Abiodun has said. He said his six-month-old administration has emplaced institutional frameworks to checkmate efforts at perpetuating financial malfeasances that may compromise due process. The governor spoke yesterday when he hosted the Transparency and Accountability Network (TAN) and other civil society groups to commemorate the International Anti-Corruption Day. Speaking through his Chief Economic Adviser, Mr. Dapo Okubadejo, the governor said through the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), State Fiscal Transparency Accountability and Sustainability Programme for Result (SFTAS) and the introduction and application of the Public Procurement Law, official corruption and sharp practices in public financial management would be curbed. Abiodun said: “These mechanisms are fool-proofed not that they also form part of international best practices.” He stressed his government’s determination to ensure accountability and zero-tolerance for corruption. The convener, TAN-Ogun State, Mrs. Adebanke Akinrimisi said the International Anti-Corruption Day is an important event designed to raise awareness on the risks associated with different forms of corruption, adding that the day is aimed at promoting a better understanding of the values and rewards of resisting corruption as an investment in long term personal and societal prosperity.
