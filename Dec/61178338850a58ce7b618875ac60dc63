An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos has ordered that a labourer, Samuel Ezeh, be remanded at Kirikiri Custodial Centre for allegedly robbing at knifepoint. Eze, 21, was accused of robbing a pedestrian of his phone. Chief Magistrate Mrs. G.O. Anifowose refused to take the defendant’s plea and ordered that he be kept at the centre until January 24 to allow the court seek advice from the director of public prosecutions. The defendant, who lives at Fatima Street in Ikotun, Lagos is being tried for conspiracy and robbery. Prosecuting Sergeant Felicia Okwori told the court that the offences were committed on December 3 at Ojudu in Ikotun. She alleged that Eze and others at large robbed Azeez Badmus of his phone valued at N25, 000 at knifepoint. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant and his accomplices robbed the complainant on his way from work. “The complainant shouted for help and the defendant was apprehended,” Okwori said.
