By Adeniyi Adewoyin European Union campaign, in partnership with the British Council, seeking to end all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, has launched ‘The Her Story Our Story Nigeria’ campaign in Nigeria. To support this cause, some Nigerian celebrities have taken to their social media handle to lend their voices to increase public awareness at state and national levels about sexual assault and violence against women. RMD said: “In the fight against sexual abuse, it is important that we Stand with the survivors of this horrible crime. By standing with survivors, rather than judging, blaming or condemning them, we not only build them up but also build a safer society for all. Where do you Stand?”  Toyin Abraham said: “Anyone can be a victim of sexual assault, regardless of their tribe, gender or religion and we have a collective responsibility to address it. We can all unite under a common responsibility to speak up against attitudes, behaviour, traditions and narratives that blame the victim and absolve the perpetrator. What will you do differently?” Others who have lend their voices include Chigul, Omoni Oboli, Omowumi, Timi Dakolo, and others, calling on all to seek immediate medical and counselling support, which is the first step towards healing and recovery for survivors of sexual assault.
