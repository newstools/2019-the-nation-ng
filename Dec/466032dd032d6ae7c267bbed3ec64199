President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) Daniel Igali has hailed the performances of the country’s wrestlers this year, describing 2019 as a ‘very good’ for Nigerian wrestling. While speaking in his office in Yenagoa, Igali, who is also the Sports Commissioner in Bayelsa State, stated that the wrestlers who won laurels at both continental and global championships this year, have performed incredibly well and deserve commendation. “I think till date, the performances of the Nigerian wrestling team this year was probably the most outstanding of the past seven, eight years,” he said. “Starting from the African Championships (in Tunisia) where, again, our women became overall African champions for the 7th time in a row, and then, looking at the 12th African Games (in Morocco), where we again dominated not only as a female team, but as the overall best team in Africa in female wrestling, male wrestling and Greco Roman by coming home with seven gold medals. “At the World Championships (in Kazakhstan) this year, Odunayo Adekuoroye (57kg) qualified for the Olympics by winning a historic bronze medal. She’s, without a doubt, become the measuring rod in NWF, winning three medals within four years at the World Championships.  That is outstanding, and you can’t really take anything away from her. “Blessing Oborududu (68kg) at the same competition (at the World Championships in Kazakhstan) was just one placing away from qualifying for the Olympics. She placed 7th.  “And Mercy Genesis (50kg) won a silver medal at the World Beach Games (in Doha), while Blessing Onyebuchi (+70kg) became our world champion in Beach wrestling by winning a gold medal. And those were the two medals Nigeria won out of the team that was presented.”
