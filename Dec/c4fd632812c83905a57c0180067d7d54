Super Eagles goal-scoring sensation Victor Osimhen has caught the eye of Jose Mourinho and the Tottenham Hotspur boss is reportedly keen on signing him from Lille. Mourinho is looking for new options in attack in a bid to keep Harry Kane fresh and in Osimhen, who can play as a central striker or in the wider roles, the 20m Euros -rated man could prove an option, according to a report in Jeunes Footeux. The 20-year-old has quickly established himself as one of the best strikers in France with 11 goals in 20 appearances for Lille so far this season and manager Christophe Galtier believes it is unlikely Osimhen would remain in Northern France in January with the likes of Barcelona and Tottenham on his heels to sell the pacy forward. The president of Lille, Gerard Lopez, had earlier given Barcelona hope of chasing Osimhen saying that the Ligue 1 side would be willing to sell the Nigerian if the right offer comes. Barca are in search of a striker to replace aging Luis Suarez, Barcelona and are looking at the 20-year-old striker as an ideal replacement. Mourinho has also signaled the go-ahead for the club to launch January raid for Osimhen’s Lille teammate Boubakary Soumare. The 20-year-old defensive midfielder has earned rave reviews for his dominating displays in Ligue 1 and  Champions League this season.
