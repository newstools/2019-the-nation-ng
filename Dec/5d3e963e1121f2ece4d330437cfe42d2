Fuji star, Sule Alao Adekunle, better known as Malaika, has been added to the list of music heavyweights billed to perform at GOtv Boxing Music Festival scheduled to hold on 28 December at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. Malaika, according to Flykite Productions, organisers of the show, will join Zlatan, Mayorkun, Oritsefemi and other artistes to perform at the show. “I’m calling on all Fuji fans to come to Tafawa Balewa Square on the day of the event as it would be a show to remember. My band is ready and raring to go,” said Malaika. In addition to the musical performances, the show will feature nine boxing bouts, including the high-profile World Boxing Federation Intercontinental heavyweight title bout between Nigeria’s Onoriode “Godzilla” Ehwariame and Argentina’s Ariel “Chiquito” Baracamonte. It will also stage two West African Boxing Union (WABU) title bouts and the national super bantamweight title duel. The WABU lightweight title will see Nigeria’s Rilwan Oladosu defend his title against Ghana’s Ezekiel Anan, while Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde will defend his WABU welterweight title against Ghana’s Sanitor Agbenyo. The vacant national super bantamweight title will be contested between Opeyemi “Sense” Adeyemi and Sadiq “Happy Boy” Adeleke. Other big names on parade include Ridwan “Scorpion” Oyekola and Cynthia “Bobby Girl” Ogunsemilore, the fast-rising female boxer, who will feature in the event’s only all-female bout.
