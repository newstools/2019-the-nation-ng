True to the cause of constantly pushing boundaries and establishing new initiatives, Access Bank recently pulled off the second edition of its Born in Africa Festival (BAFEST). The highly entertaining fusion of music, art, film and fashion, held at Eko Atlantic, Lagos. The full day event, designed to uniquely celebrate the distinct dynamism of the true African spirit, birthed from a need to tell the true story of Africa in its different forms. Speaking on the importance of repositioning Africa and changing its narrative, Group Head, Communications & External Affairs, Access Bank Plc, Amaechi Okobi, said; “This year, we’re doing more for the culture. Last year, we realised how important it was for we Africans to tell our stories and express our truth in the truest forms. We are proud to be doing this yet again with the second edition of BAFEST. We had a successful event last year and we’re sure that the day-long event will this year, prove to Africans and the rest of the world the need to celebrate our culture, traditions, history and our future.” The Born In Africa Festival (BAFEST) 2019 will feature notable music stars like Burna Boy, Mr Real, Ice Prince, Tiwa Savage, Naira Marley, Patoranking, Niniola, Teni, Seyi Shay, Joe Boy, 9ice and Becca amongst others. Eko Atlantic will on Sunday be open, to attendees, from 9am with models, designers and movie makers like Tokyo James, Odio Mimonet, Wisdom Franklin, David Tlale, Millen Magese, Maria Borges, Adesuwa Aighewi and others on hand to showcase their work.
