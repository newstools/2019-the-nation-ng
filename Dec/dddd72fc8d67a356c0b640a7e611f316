By Damola Kola-Dare  For 21-year-old Gloria Adagbogun, her glorious moment came at Crawford University convocation last week, where she was the cynosure of all eyes after she clinched the award of the institution’s Best Graduating student with a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 4.88 in Microbiology. The ecstatic Gloria who had words of praise for God and her parents said: “I feel so excited and I want to thank my parents for making me stand here today.” However, beyond the glee and excitement, Gloria said she faced challenges – noting that hard work, determination and God’s help saw her through. “There were times I wanted to sleep but could not.  It was really challenging at times. I had some courses I had to read for double time. I stayed up late to read them thoroughly.  Sometimes, I was ill. But thank God, it paid off through determination and hard work.” The second child and daughter of the Adagbogun family, who said she was to attend UNIPORT, thanked her parents for the support when it was decided she should attend Crawford. “I had some challenges when I came to Crawford University because initially I was to attend University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) but my mother brought me here. With my father, she urged me not to lose focus. They supported me and I kept on pushing till I achieved my aim,” she said.  Speaking on what motivated her, she said she was inspired to work hard when she attended previous graduation. She said: “I witnessed a glorious convocation here.  I was motivated by what I saw. From then, I aspired to be the best and I started to study hard like never before.” Gloria said discipline was key to achieving her aim. “Motivation gets you started, then discipline is quite important. There are times you are tired. For you to be the best, you have to sacrifice and also trust God for the right direction.  Again, you need to be consistent in all things,”she said.
