 IMPROPER electrical wiring and inadequate maintenance of electrical and other equipment caused the electrocution of five inmates on Monday at the Ikoyi Custodial Centre of the Nigerian Correctional Service, The Nation learnt on Tuesday. The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), which supplies power to the facility, claimed that wires in the affected cell were “left dangling without proper trunking or pinning.” It said the deceased inmates were sitting on the floor or leaning on the bunk beds, without clothes or shoes which could have insulated them from the power surge. On Monday, Minister of Interior Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola confirmed the deaths of five inmates and injuries to seven others, during a visit to the facility. The inmates were electrocuted in their cells following a power surge at about 7am, he said, adding that he had set up a team to probe the incident. EEDC General Manager (Corporate Communication) Idemudia Godwin, who absolved the company of blame, told The Nation that EEDC officials visited the scene and investigated the incident. It said their findings, in a report titled, ‘Investigation report on third party incident at Ikoyi Prisons’ showed that the Centre’s electrical wiring must be updated or risk  another occurrence. He said: “A team comprising of Island District Staff (DLO, DSM, SMD) went to the Prisons for an investigation into the alleged electrocution. “On gaining access to the prisons, we met with AGP Tukor (prisons HQ, Abuja) who had also come to investigate the incident. The team was shown round by the coordinator of Ikoyi prisons ACP Ogunsakin Tolu and went to the scene of the incident”.
