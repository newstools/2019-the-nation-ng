by Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi Nigeria-born actress, Victoria Inyama, presently residing in London, United Kingdom, has become a graduate of University of East London. The actress who posted pictures from her graduation ceremony revealed that the university gave back all the confidence she has lost due to domestic abuse. Captioning one of the pictures where she is spotted with two of her lecturers, she wrote, “This university gave me back all d Confidence/Self-worth/ self-esteem I lost in all my years of Domestic Abuse:  A university where the lecturers really care about the students/ was taught to always think outside the box/reason intelligently…I thoroughly enjoyed every minute… Hopefully back in a bit for another round. “Still reeling from Excitement, four years ago, I decided to make a new choice. Whatever happened doesn’t define me now but propelled me to whom I am becoming. I am Back. More Aware / More Empowered/ Wiser / Stronger / More Determined.” Inyama began her career in 1990. She got married to Godwin Okri and relocated to United Kingdom in a move which truncated her acting career.
