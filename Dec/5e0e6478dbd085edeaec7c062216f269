A chapter has ended for the Babatunde Fowler, who was the Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) until recently. Since President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to replace him with the Coordinating Director, Domestic Taxes Group, Abiodun Aina, mixed reactions have trailed. It was even suggested that staff members of the FIRS would embark on strike as a support for their boss. There were also leaked documents suggesting that Fowler begged to remain in that capacity. All that is bygone and it is certain that the tax collector’s days as FIRS boss have ended. Now, everyone is anxious of Fowler’s next steps. Inasmuch as he has made lots of friends, he also stepped on toes, as outlined by his predecessor, Aina, at the handover ceremony. Born on August 12, 1956, Fowler was at a time the Executive Chairman, Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue, and the Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Internal Revenue Service. He attended Igbobi College in Lagos and had his university at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where he obtained a bachelor in science in economics and a minor in political science in 1978. He completed a second bachelor’s degree programme at California State University, Los Angeles, and a Master of Business Administration degree
