Pastor Adesoji Ajayi (JP),  Lagos  SIR: The governments at all should find solution to the lingering crisis of unemployment in the country. Since the sale of over 85 per cent of our factories (particularly the garment factories) by some overzealous and clueless leaders of previous Governments, things have never remained the same again in Nigeria. Youth unemployment account for more that 60per cent of total joblessness and restiveness  in the country. Nigeria is a highly religious nation, but religiosity without Humanity is vanity. Religious leaders are advised to tow the path of love as enshrined in the Bible and the Quran. Religious leaders have a role to play to emancipate our people and not to emasculate them. Nigerians should be advised not to peddle fake new. Fake news should be effectively checked. It is a time bomb that should not be allowed to explode. It is a potential instrument that can cause disintegration of the country. The bill at the National Assembly over fake new and 419 fraudsters should be handle with care. The death penalty aspect of the bill should be completely removed. It is ridiculous that our National Assembly is reading a bill on death penalty at a time the whole world is discussing the removal of death penalty from penal code. Nigeria is an interesting country where those who served their motherland for over 30 years find it difficult to receive their pension. But our political leaders who served the nation for between 4 to 8 years are clamoring for jumbo payments as pension for life! May God save our country from political looters who call themselves leaders. They should emulate the modest life style of our President – Muhammadu Buhari. A lot of those already flying the cart of taking over from President Buhari are political jobbers who don’t have anything good to ffer. President Buhari should therefore shine his eyes and ensure that he does not destroy his good legacies built over the years to a looter president in 2023.  Lagos
