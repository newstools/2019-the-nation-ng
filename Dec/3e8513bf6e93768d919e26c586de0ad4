 In Ondo State, some of the federal roads are Ipele-Isua-Akunnu, Ikare-Arigidi-Okeagbe-Oyin Akoko, Owo-Oka-Isua-Akoko, Ikare-Ado Ekiti and Ore-Sagamu. The Nation investigation shows that the condition of majority of these roads is deplorable. Travelers are therefore groaning on daily basis, calling on the federal government to at least rehabilitate the roads. Some road users alleged that if the roads have been maintained, most of the road accidents, especially in Akoko axis, would have been drastically reduced, as it would have served as alternative roads to the clumsy Oka Akoko-Abuja road. In fact, Ondo State Government has expressed displeasure at the condition of the federal roads in the state. It vowed to fix them for the benefit of the people in the sunshine state. Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Saka Yusuf- Ogunleye, expressed displeasure over the roads during an inspection of the failed portion of the roads Ogunleye noted that though the roads are owned by the federal government, they are being used by the people of the state, hence the need for the inspection. He said” The present government of Oluwarotimi Akeredolu cannot fold its arms and watch these roads become impassable. We have decided to intervene on behalf of our people. Our people remain the priority. Anything that affects them must be tackled. We have to make our roads safe regardless of maybe they are federal roads or not,” he said. He explained that the state government was compiling the list of the roads to be fixed across the state, adding that the state government had earlier intervened in Owo/Ikare and Owo/Ose roads, which are all federal roads. He said that the state government was going to replicate the gesture in all other federal roads that are in poor state. He said the state government intended to liase with the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) on the need for the federal government to fix the roads.
