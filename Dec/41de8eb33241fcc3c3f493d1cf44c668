Onimisi Alao, Yola  A staff of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Adamawa State, Ibrahim Waziri, has been kidnapped. According to a family source who spoke to reporters on Saturday, Ibrahim Waziri was abducted in the early house of Thursday.“ “The gunmen in their numbers stormed his house at Shagari Quarters in Yola and whisked him away,” the source said, adding, “We were all thrown into confusion as a result of the development.” The source said the kidnappers had called the family and demanded N7 million ransom. “The kidnappers have called and demanded N7 million ransom but we told them that the kidnapped fellow was the breadwinner of this family. “The man is the one shouldering the responsibility of all the family, so we told the kidnappers that the man can’t have money in view of the weight he shoulders. “But the kidnappers insisted that they don’t kidnap anybody unless they are sure that he has money,” the family member said. He added that the family had brought down the demand to N2 million and had started selling the man’s belongings to raise the money. Reacting to the development, the Public Relations Officer for the Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said the Command had deployed operatives to fish out the kidnappers and get the INEC staff released.
