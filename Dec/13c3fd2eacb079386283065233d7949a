Aaron Cresswell fired West Ham to their first Premier League win at Chelsea in 17 years to hand a big boost to under-fire boss Manuel Pellegrini. Cresswell’s third league goal of the campaign sealed the 1-0 Stamford Bridge triumph, ending West Ham’s streak of eight matches without a win in all competitions. The left-back turned Reece James inside out before whipping past Kepa Arrizabalaga to condemn Frank Lampard to defeat in his first match as Chelsea boss against old club West Ham. The Hammers sealed their first win since the 2-0 home victory over Manchester United on September 22, as Chelsea struggled without injured England striker Tammy Abraham. The 10-goal Premier League star suffered a hip injury in Wednesday’s 2-2 Champions League draw at Valencia and the Blues could only claw at attacking fluidity with Frenchman Olivier Giroud up front. Manager Lampard had admitted before facing West Ham that the club were yet to determine how long Abraham would be sidelined. And on this evidence the Stamford Bridge men will want the 22-year-old back in full flow as quickly as possible. Chelsea paid the ultimate price for a string of squandered first-half chances, with Lampard’s men surrendering an unbeaten home run of 13 league matches dating back to 2002 against the Hammers. For embattled West Ham boss Pellegrini a fourth league win of the term would undoubtedly ease the pressure, with clashes against Wolves and Arsenal up next.
