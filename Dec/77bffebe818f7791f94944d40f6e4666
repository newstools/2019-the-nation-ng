Under pressure English Premier League side Arsenal  are ready to break the bank  in January  for  Leicester City’s  Super Eagles combative midfielder Wilfred Ndidi with a massive £40m (about  N18,756,692,500)being bandied as the transfer fee. New Gunners boss Mikel Arteta knows one of his most pressing priorities is to make Arsenal much tougher to beat, with serious questions having been raised over the defence for some time. Defensive midfielder Ndidi could help give Arsenal’s back four some protection, having done so for a Leicester team which has conceded just 14 goals this season – the joint lowest amount in the Premier League along with Liverpool. And the Gunners are set to offer Granit Xhaka plus £40million as they bid to sign Nigeria international Ndidi, according to Leicestershire Live. Ndidi has been a key figure as the Foxes have shot up to second place in the Premier League under manager Brendan Rodgers this season. He has made 20 appearances in all competitions, scoring two goals, with his most recent coming in a 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle United in September. Since his move from Genk in January 2017, the 23-year-old has made 120 appearances for Leicester and has become a key part of the Foxes midfield. Before Arteta’s appointment as Arsenal boss last week, Swiss midfielder Xhaka had been given a fresh start by interim boss Freddie Ljungberg.
