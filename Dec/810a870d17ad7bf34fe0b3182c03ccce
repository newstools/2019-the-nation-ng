Our Reporter  Since its release on Netflix, Seven And A Half Dates, a Bigsam Media Production movie, has received countless reviews on social media from viewers. The movie, which focuses on the pressure young women face when it comes to marriages, successfully infused other issues surrounding family and relationships. Engrossed in her career but pressurised by her mum, a young lady: Bisola, played by Mercy Johnson, is forced to attend several dates just to get a suitor and in the process helps her sister out of an abusive relationship. After its release in cinemas on August 3, 2018, it was No. 1 at the box office in Nigeria. Few weeks ago, it released on Netflix, and viewers have described the film as real, humorous and upholding moral. “Awesome movie, Toyin killed her character,” Olivia-Uwa Ojeaga commented on facebook. Another viewer, who went on social media to express his excitement after seeing the movie on Netflix, said “everything about it is outstanding … every single guy or lady that’s in this film delivered perfectly.”  With a comedy infusion through Bisola’s assistant, played by Toyin Abraham, it has been applauded for passing a very strong message, with characters like Mercy Johnson, Toyin Abraham, Frank Donga, Jim Iyke, Sola Sobowale, Bayray Mcwizu, Akin Lewis, and other amazing actors. Executive Producer of the movie Samuel ‘Big Sam’ Olatunji said: “The reaction has been immense, impressive and encouraging…thank you to all the people that have watched and told others to watch. ‘’We are hopeful that our next movie, Dear Affy, will break boundaries across borders.” Seven And A Half Dates was directed by Biodun Stephen and produced by Toyin Abraham. Big Sam said he has just finished directing Dear Affy, his first feature film, which would be in cinemas in February.
