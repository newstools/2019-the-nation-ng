As part of its activities to marks the 25th anniversary of the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF), Dubai Tourism is set to delight Nigerians with prizes and free trips to the country. The state and its partners are kicking off several competitions offering Nigerians and Ghanaians the chance to win big just in time for the holidays. The gifts include shopping vouchers or fully funded trips to Dubai to enjoy unique experiences, world-class concerts, pop up markets and events. Also, daily firework will be displaying during the festival, from December 26, 2019 to February 1, 2020. Commenting on the contest, Head of Campaign Management for Africa, Salim Ali Mohammed Dahman said that the Dubai Shopping Festival has been always been an event that the entire city really gets into. “Now going into its 25th anniversary means it will be grander than ever before. We know that our African visitors love to shop; whether for luxury items or just the basics, they rate shopping as one of the top things they love to do when visiting Dubai. For us, we wanted to take this special occasion to invite first time visitors or those coming back to Dubai again with a warm welcome and a heavy dose of retail therapy. As a city, we are rolling out the red carpet to celebrate this milestone and encourage everyone in Nigeria and Ghana to participate in this competition.”
