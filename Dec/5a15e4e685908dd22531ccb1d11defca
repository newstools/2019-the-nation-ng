THE Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) says it has deployed 1,500 officers to ease traffic during the Yuletide. General Manager Mr. Olajide Oduyoye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sideline of the inauguration of the Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS) headquarters in Lagos on Tuesday that LASTMA would not let Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, commuters and the motoring public down during the festivity. Said he: “We will work as usual. We know there is going to be a lot of pressure. We know we need to be visible and do the work diligently. “This is a special moment for the public to appreciate the efforts we are making. “We will not let the governor and Lagosians down. “This is what we will try and achieve during the Christmas and New Year festivities. “We have about 1,500 officers out to ease traffic flow. We are covering the whole of Lagos State, but there are choked points will we give attention.” The LASTMA boss said although officers would cover all parts of the state, special attention would be given to Victoria Island, Ikeja and others because of the event centres and other attractions. He said that the agency would also not relax in other areas. Oduyoye urged the motoring public and commuters to know that a lot of road repairs were going on, hence the need to be patient, obey traffic laws and listen to traffic managers.
