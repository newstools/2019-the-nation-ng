Ohanaeze Ndigbo has warned some Igbo renegades who make defeatist comments on the chances of Ndigbo to produce the next Nigeria President in 2023 to shut their mouths or face dire consequences. The apex Igbo sociocultural organization said some cowardly disposed Igbo elements, against all sense of decorum, have been making comments that depict them as cowards and agents of anti -Igbo political integrity in Nigeria “and we can no longer tolerate that.” A statement by its deputy publicity secretary, Chuks Ibegbu remarked: “No Northerner or Westerner and Niger Deltan will come out openly and express doubt over the chances of their people to get their legitimate rights in Nigeria, it’s only few Igbo renegades that do so.” “They are the ones easily used to betray their people,” Ibegbu regretted. It recalled that maverick politician “Arthur Nzeribe did it, Daniel Kanu did it, and now Charles Enya and Chinedu Ogah in Ebonyi are doing it. Are they the only ones that need money in Igbo land? Why should they not use their brain and keep their mouths shut if they are frustrated or lack what to say.” The group threatened them with the consequences of ostracising by their communities if they continue embarrassing Ndigbo.
