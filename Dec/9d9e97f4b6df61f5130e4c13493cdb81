The statement signed by Gabriel Odu, Media, Public Relations and Protocol, NiDCOM stated: “Latest reports indicate that the two Nigerians detained in Bosnia Border Camp have been released and are airborne back home to Nigeria. “We commend the quick intervention of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geofrey Onyeama; the Nigerian Ambassador to Hungary, Ambassador Eniola Ajayi and staff of the mission, and the unrelenting efforts of the Chairman/CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa. “The Commission earnestly waits for their safe return.” It will be recalled that the two Nigerians were arrested while taking a walk around the capital on November 18 as they couldn’t produce relevant documents to the Police. The police officers reportedly transferred them to Bosnia-Herzegovina border, where Croatian authorities had gathered a group of irregular migrants making efforts to cross into the country.
