Jurgen Klopp has warned Flamengo that they have never faced a team like Liverpool ahead of the final of the Fifa Club World Cup final today. The Reds set up a clash with the Copa Libertadores holders by beating CONCACAF champions Monterrey courtesy of a 90th-minute Roberto Firmino goal on Wednesday evening. That victory has provided Klopp with the first opportunity in his managerial career to come up against Brazilian opposition. But, when asked whether that unfamiliarity makes things trickier for the final, the German offered a simple, confident reply. He said: “You said I never played against a Brazilian team, that’s true. But I am ready to win this game. “But Flamengo never played against a team like Liverpool as well, and we will see who can make more of this tomorrow night.” Liverpool have been hit with criticism over their decision to leave a team of youth players behind to contest a League Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa this week in order to take the first-team squad to Qatar.
