 President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday requested the Senate to confirm the appointment of Muhammad Mamman Nami, from Northcentral, as the new Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The President also requested the Senate to confirm Edward Lametek Adamu as the chairman of Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). Senate President Ahmad Lawan read President Buhari’s separate letters for the two positions at plenary. The President also named other members of the board of the FIRS in his letter. They are: James Yakwen Ayuba (Northcentral), Ado Danjuma (Northwest), Adam Baba Mohammed (Northeast), A. Ikeme Osakwe (Southeast), Adewale Ogunyomade (Southwest) and Ehile Adetola Aigbangbee (Southsouth). The representatives of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) also named by the President are: Ladidi Bara’atu Mohammed (Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation), Godwin Emefiele (Central Bank of Nigeria) and Fatima Z. Hayatu (Ministry of Finance). Others include Maagbe S. Adaa (Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission), Umar Ajiya (Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation), Deputy Comptroller General T.M. Isah (Nigeria Customs Service) and the Registrar General of the Corporate Affairs Commission. President Buhari, on Monday, named a tax consultant, Mr Nami, as the new chairman of the FIRS. This followed the expiration of the tenure of Mr Babatunde Fowler. The erstwhile FIRS chairman has since handed over the affairs of the service to the most senior director in the agency, pending the confirmation of Nami and other members of the board by the Senate.
