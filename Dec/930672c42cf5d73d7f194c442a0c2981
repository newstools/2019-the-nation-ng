Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said all backlog owed to pensioners will be cleared. Sanwo-Olu spoke in Ikeja, during the Lagos Pensioners Reunion, organised by the Civil Service Pensions Office, Lagos State Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions. Represented by the Commissioner for  Establishments, Training and Pensions, Ajibola Ponnle, Sanwo-Olu, said that the administration has the welfare of both current and retired staff as its priority. “Within the first 100 days of this administration, we had the plan and approval of N13.75 Billion made to add to the redemption bond shuffle for staff and retired permanent secretaries and we increased the redemption bond funding rate from 5 per cent of total emolument of staff to 10 per cent of the emolument.” This, he said was to ensure that by the end of the first term of the administration, it would have cleared the entire backlog owed to pensioners. “We are currently paying year 2017 redemption bond arrears to pensioners and we are doing this at an increased rate. We have also increased the government’s contributory pension rate from 7.5 to 10 per cent contribution. Sanwo-Olu assured of the continuous welfare of all pensioners in the state, noting that the event is a manifestation of the administration promises of ensuring that every citizen irrespective of age is not left behind during policy consideration, while also ensuring that senior citizens are provided all the benefits a Lagos State citizen should get. He noted that plans are at an advanced stage to start the initiative in free health insurance and free transport in the state by 2020. “We are still looking at it but we hope it will be effectively implemented. We will have free transportation for all those that have served the state and are above 60 years with the various means of transportation owned by Lagos state government.
