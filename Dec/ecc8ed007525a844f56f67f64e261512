Our Reporter  Ondo State Unity Forum, a group within the Ondo State chapter of the All progressives Congress (APC), led by former Deputy Governor Ali Olanusi, has commended the National Working Committee (NWC) for setting up the Reconciliation Committee headed by the Senate President Ahmed Lawan to look into the grievances of members. Olanusi, in a statement, said the setting up of the committee was timely, in view of the fact that the state is preparing for the governorship election. He said: “The constitution of the committee cannot come at a better time than now when we are approaching the 2020 gubernatorial election.  The move is also more salutary and imbued with confidence that it is being led by no other party loyalist than  the Senate President Alhaji Ahmed Lawan. Also, that the party went for a leader like Lawan is a demonstration of its readiness to ensure fairness, justice and equity for all aggrieved members knowing the pedigree of the Senate President.” “We are confident that with the caliber of other prominent party stalwarts in the Committee, they would do a thorough job to reposition the Party, at all levels in the State for better performance. Olanusi added: “As peace-loving party members, this development is what we have long awaited rather than resorting to fracas and blood-letting. The Unity Forum wishes to express our unalloyed support and confidence in the Adams Oshiomole-led National Working Committee.”
