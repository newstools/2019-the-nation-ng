Osagie Otabor, Bénin  The Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State has urged warring factions of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state not to turn the state to “Kabul” the capital of war torn Afghanistan. It condemned the grandstanding of what it termed various factions of the Edo APC with regards to the ‘factional rally’ scheduled for Friday the 13th. A statement by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Chris Nehikhare, noted that in the last 24 to 48 hours, ‘Edo people have been inundated with threats and counter threats from the at least three factions that exist in a party that is known for its intolerance and propensity for violence, maiming, and arson.’ Nehikhare, however, said there is light at the end of the tunnel as Edo people would have a chance to vote and chase the APC out of town in a few months. “Their intolerance has led to the non-representation of up to 14 constituencies in the state house of assembly since its proclamation, the attacks and maiming on their own members in Owan, Estako Central and Ovia North-East local government areas in Edo state. “They are now upping the ante by boasting and accusing each other of importing thugs from Kogi State. We are all aware of the antecedents of Kogi APC thugs. “We hereby call on the police and other security agencies to be at alert as the build-up tensions by the disgruntled factions in Edo APC can only deliver sorrow, tears and blood. “We advice that a proper and effective security arrangement is put in place to checkmate these “tatatata political” misfits. “Edo PDP sympathise with Edo people who are now made to feel insecure and bear the brunt of the naked and crude power play within a party that was foist off on them.”
