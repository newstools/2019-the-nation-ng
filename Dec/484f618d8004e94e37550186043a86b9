 CATHOLIC priest who lost his life in a fire incident in Nnewichi–Nnewi, Anambra State, Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Edmund Nwagbara, has received a post-humous Distinguished Service Award from the University of Nigeria Alumni Association (UNAA). Nwagbara of St Peter Claver’s Catholic Church, who died in his Parish house on November 16, was penciled down for the award before death struck.  The University of Nigeria Alumni Association at her 25th Biennial Convention and 103 National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held at Nnewi, Anambra State, praised the starling qualities of the departed priest, which gave rise to the post-humous award.  Speaking at the ceremony, President of UNAA Nnewi Branch, Ndubuisi Okoli, described the deceased priest as devoted and unassuming. He said: “Late Fr. Nwagbala had the ability to associate with people of all classes who devoted his time in taking care of the sick, the poor and the less privileged. “He was fully devoted to his priestly calling, giving attention to ensure the spiritual and temporal growth of his parishioners. “His uncommon charisma in homily delivery endeared him to many of his parishioners both within and outside the country while his uncommon wisdom and charity attracted people from all works of life and faith to him.” Earlier, National President of UNAA, Sir Ben Okoronkwo, said the association was bigger than any individual or group of individuals working to distract her from galvanising the much-needed support to positively impact the university.” Senatorial District, Dr. Ifeanyi Ubah; substantive Dean, Faculty of Health Science and Technology, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Professor Pauline Ezenduka; Dr. Daniel Chimuanya Ugwuanyi and the Obi of Awka-Etiti, Igwe Michael -Chidozie Ezeudenna.
