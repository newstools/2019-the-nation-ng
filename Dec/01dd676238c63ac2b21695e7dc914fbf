Wilfred Ndidi will start against Liverpool as Leicester takes on Liverpool in one of Boxing Day fixture in the English Premier League today in the top of the table clash. The Nigerian international was linked with a move to the Emirate with Arsenal ready to splash about N18.7 billion (£40million). Gunners manager  Mikel Arteta knows one of his most pressing priorities is to make Arsenal much tougher to beat, with serious questions having been raised over the defence for some time. Defensive midfielder Ndidi could help give Arsenal’s back four some protection, having done so for a Leicester team which has conceded just 14 goals this season – the joint lowest amount in the Premier League along with Liverpool . However, the Nigerian will be on duty today as Leicester hopes to beat Liverpool for the first time this season and reduce the deficit between the two teams with Kops leading the home team by 10 points and having one game at hand. The Foxes missed the chance to close the gap on their visitors during Liverpool’s time away at the Club World Cup when they lost 3-1 to Manchester City in the last game.
