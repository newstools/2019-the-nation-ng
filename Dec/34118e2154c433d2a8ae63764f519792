Within the framework of the implementation of the new strategic plan of the African Insurance Organisation, the Secretary General, Mr. Jean Baptiste Ntukamazina, has embarked on a tour to some regional organisations and local markets. A  statement from the AIO Secretariat stated that Mr. Ntukamazina is in Dakar, Senegal to hold talks with officials of FANAF as well as the local insurance market. The statement read: “His outing falls in line with enhancing the advocacy, market building and networking roles of the African Insurance Oragnisation as prescribed by the new strategic plan. “The AIO Secretary General’s visit will enable him to carry out an on-the-spot assessment of the needs and expectations of the various stakeholders vis-à-vis the organisation, as well as get proposals on the best ways the African Insurance Organisation can better serve their interest. “The Executive Committee of the African Insurance Organisation recently adopted a new strategic plan whose aim is to make the AIO contribute to increase Africa’s insurance penetration, advocate for its members, become a centre of competence for the African insurance industry and double its share of members among African insurers”, it added.
