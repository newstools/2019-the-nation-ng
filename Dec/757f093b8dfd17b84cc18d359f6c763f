Following the suspension of their transfer ban, Villarreal star Samuel Chukwueze has emerged as a target for Chelsea ahead of the January transfer window. Spanish tabloid Marca reports that the Blues are closely monitoring the progress of the Nigeria forward who has contributed three goals and an assist in La Liga this season. Chukwueze joins Crystal Palaceâ€™s Wilfried Zaha in the list of options and his buyout clause of 60 million Euros would not be a challenge for Frank Lampard, who reportedly has more than 175m Euros the winter.
