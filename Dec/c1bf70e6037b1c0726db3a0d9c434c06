 The Body of Retired Heads of Local Government Administration (BORHOLGAS) in Ogun State on Wednesday bemoaned their plight, following their alleged eight years of unpaid gratuities by past administrations. They appealed to Governor Dapo Abiodun to address the problem. BORHOLGAS said members were last paid their entitlements in August 2011. The body in a statement by its Social/Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kayode Ekundayo, said that local government retirees were ageing, ailing and dying, as they could not afford good living or medical care, due to lack of funds. “While we are not unmindful of the general economic situation, the group appeals to the governor to see to the consolidation of the monthly pension and the payment of gratuity to the local government pensioners, which has been in arrears for eight years,” the group said. The retirees hailed Governor Abiodun for the pace at which his administration was changing the face of the state, especially infrastructural improvements in the public schools. They hoped that the present administration would be compassionate to them. The group said members have contributed to the growth and development of the state. It urged the people to support the Abiodun administration in order to move the state forward.
