Gov Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Monday, signed the N213 billion 2020 appropriation bill into law. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Makinde presented the budget to the state House of Assembly on Nov 28, while the bill was passed into law on Dec 20. The budget, which the lawmakers increased by N4.4 billion, was signed into law at the Executive Council chambers of the governor’s office, Agodi in Ibadan. In his remark at the occasion, the governor said that the budget was in line with his administration’s document on the roadmap for accelerated development of the state and also represented the aspirations of the people. He observed that the upward review of the bill sent to the Assembly by N4.4 billion cut across capital expenditure and recurrent expenditure. Makinde said he remained committed to ensuring about 70 percent implementation of the budget. The Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Debo Ogundoyin, remarked that the increment in the budget was to enhance widespread development, particularly at the grassroots. NAN reports that the occasion was witnessed by members of the state executive council, PDP chieftains and some political office holders. (NAN)
