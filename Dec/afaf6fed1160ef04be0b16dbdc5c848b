 The Chairman, Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, Nigeria Export Processing Zone Authority, NEPZA, Samari Yakubu is soliciting government support to revamp free zones scheme in the country. Samari said the present administration has shown commitment in diversifying the economy through the free zone scheme by upgrading existing ones and developing new zones. The Chairman disclosed this at the 2019 NEPZA Union seminar in Abuja, assuring that the unions at the National and Unit levels are not resting on its oars to unravel the identity of the enemies of progress wanting to thwart the effort of the government on free zone agenda. According to Samari, “The struggle is predicated on our commitment to upholding the vision of the free zone scheme first. We want the management of the agency to prioritize the welfare of staff, like our condition of service. “Promotion exams in the organization are like taking a walk in Sambisa forest and coming out alive, the 2019 staff training has not commenced, 13month allowance that used to be paid before this period of the year is hanging, while Christmas bonus is begging for attention”. Samari pleads that the narrative must change as NEPZA unit is hereby appealing to the management to match words with action and settle these issues with the aim of giving the entire staff a high level of relief. The outgoing Acting Managing Director, NEPZA, Terhemba Nnogo said the organization has done very well, the upgrade of Kano and Calabar free trade zones is almost completed. We want to get investors for manufacturing, only for export.
