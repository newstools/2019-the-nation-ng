THE de-worming of livestock carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Nasarawa State has impacted positively on the health of livestock, some pastoralists said. The benefiting pastoralists are from Nasawara Awe and Keana local government areas of the state. Some of them who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said they had started seeing the positive impact of the exercise. Dere Umar, a pastoralist from Bakono village, said they saw worms in the faeces of the cattle that had been de-wormed just after 24 hours. “ICRC has de-wormed no fewer than 5,000 cattle in the village,” Umar said. Similarly, Alhaji IIiyasu Yakubu, a pastoralist from Aisa community of Loko, said before the intervention by ICRC, they were challenges with de-worming their livestock. “Worms infested the liver of cows; we did not know how to solve that problem until the ICRC came to our rescue; they started the exercise in Gidan Bawa. “We thank God for the support, because before now, we had never received such assistance; I have been in this place since Shehu Shagari came to power in 1979,” Yakubu said. In an interview with NAN, Mr Aliyu Dawobe, Public Relations Officer ICRC, said the organisation was targeting 140,000 livestock in three local governments of the state for the exercise. Dawobe said the organisation would de-worm 100,000 cattle and 40,000 goats and sheep in Awe Iga, Loko and Keana. He said the exercise, which started on November 28, to end December 19, had covered 60,000 livestock in two communities each in Awe Iga and Loko districts. “The aim of the exercise is to improve the health of herders’ animals affected by violence and conflict. “There is a gap between health workers that are providing veterinary services and livestock keepers. “Most of the time when conflict happens, you find out that livestock keepers are skeptical about going out, and animal health workers are also afraid to access the headers and give them support.”
