 AS Lagos State joined the rest of the world on Thursday to observe the World Soil day, the government warned against illegal sand mining, urging those involved to desist from the act which removes vital resource protecting the soil. At a press parley as part of activities to mark the day, the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, advised residents to desist from indiscriminate tree cutting which also damages the soil. Bello stated that the state is committed to preventing further soil erosion in the state through identification and recovering of all erosion prone areas and conserving them for better productive use. He added that the theme for the 2019 World Soil Day is to raise awareness on the importance of sustaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being by encouraging all sectors around the world to engage proactively in improving soil health. The theme “Stop Soil Erosion Save Our Future” according to the Commissioner is apt at this time, as efforts must be made towards raising the profile of healthy soil and curb erosion to encourage agricultural development.
