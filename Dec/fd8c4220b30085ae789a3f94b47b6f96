The event will take place on December 17, 2019, at Agip Hall of MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos, at 10 a.m. The family’s spokesman Chief Akinwande Delano said two of the books written by the late author are: A Dictionary of Yoruba Monosyllabic Verbs and Selected Works of Delano. He said the main objective of the public presentation of the books was “to set up an endowment fund for the promotion of teaching and studying of Yoruba language at all levels”. An America-based Nigerian scholar, Professor Toyin Falola, will give elaborate analysis on Delano’s work in a lecture, titled: Cultural Modernity in A Colonised World. An annual Delano Prize in Yoruba Studies, to be managed by Yoruba Studies Review and the Pan-African University Press, will be unveiled at the event.
