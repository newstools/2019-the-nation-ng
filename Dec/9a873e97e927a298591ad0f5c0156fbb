Rivers State governor, Barr. Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has called on ex-servicemen in the state to stand united, if they wish to achieve success. Wike stated this while launching the 2020 Emblem Appeal Fund, marking the commencement of activities for the 2020 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebrations in Rivers State yesterday. The governor commended members of the Nigerian Legion for settling the internal rancor that once divided the body. He said: “I am happy that the Nigerian Legion, Rivers State Command is now united. With unity, you can achieve more for your members in the state.” He directed the Secretary to the Rivers State Government to immediately release the N60million pledge made to the legion during the crisis. He also directed the Commissioner of Finance to work with the local government council chairmen for the release of N23million pledged during  the legion’s crisis and further pledged N10 million  for the 2020 Appeal Fund. The governor assured that the state government would continue to support ex-servicemen because they laid down their lives for the unity of the country. He said: “Today is meant to support those who fought for the country. Those who denied themselves sleep in order to protect the rest of us. “There is nothing that will be too much to support the veterans.  Nothing will be too much to support the widows and children that the war heroes left behind.” Chairman of the Nigerian Legion, Rivers State Command,  ACG Justice Chichi (Rtd) , informed the Rivers State governor that the crisis that once bedeviled the body had been resolved by the state government. He regretted that it is only Wike who caters for the needs of ex-servicemen and their families. He pledged that the legion will continue to support Governor Wike to deliver good governance.
