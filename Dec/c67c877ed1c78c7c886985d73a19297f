THE Lagos edition of the new music reality show ‘Access The Stars’ got a boost as Naira Marley, Niniola and others delivered a show-stopping performance in Lagos. Naira Marley put up a stellar performance just as Reekado brought his A-game to the stage. SkiiBii and Niniola also displayed their showmanship. The Access The Stars train now heads to Abuja where the trio of judges – Tee-Y Mix, Kaffy and Seyi Shay – will be tasked with selecting the best talents the capital city has to offer. Speaking ahead of the Abuja auditions, Tee-Y Mix said: “Abuja is a special city and it’s home to some of the most talented artists I know. I am convinced that we will find some amazing talents in Abuja, and I am super excited to head to FCT for the next round of auditions.” The Abuja auditions will be held at Grand Ibro Hotel, Micheal Okpara Street, while the concert is slated for Old Parade Ground Car Park, Abuja. The Abuja show is set to up the ante, as Zlatan, SkiiBii, Fireboy, and Wande Coal are set to return to perform alongside the five final contestants who will slug it out to make it to the next round of the competition. Access The Stars is sponsored by Star Lager Beer and Access Bank. The winner of the show will walk home with up to 150 million Naira in cash and prizes.
