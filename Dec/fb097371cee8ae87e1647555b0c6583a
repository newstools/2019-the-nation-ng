The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun on Friday said that 338 lives were lost in road accidents across the state from January till date. Ogun FRSC Sector Commander, Clement Oladele, disclosed this in Abeokuta at a one-day seminar on road safety during festive period, organised by Ogun Caretaker Committee on Transportation in conjunction with Tunes Communications Ltd. He noted that it was unfortunate that the number of deaths recorded so far in the state was higher than that of 2018. “In 2015, 293 deaths were recorded, 270 recorded in 2016, 210 recorded in 2017 while 279 deaths were recorded in 2018. “Fifty per cent of the accidents happened at road construction sites and diversion areas especially on the highways. “During the Ember months campaign that just started, 10 deaths had already been recorded. “Most of these accidents were caused by speed violation, wrongful overtaking and break failure,’’ he said. He advised motorists to drive safely, obey traffic rules and regulations, especially during and after the festive period. He said that the command would continue to ensure that the roads were safe and punish traffic offenders accordingly. In her remark, Mrs Noimot Salako -Oyedele, Ogun Deputy Governor, noted that the transport committee was inaugurated to manage the smooth transition of transport union executives. She urged transport union workers, especially the drivers, to avoid drinking while driving so as not to toy with the security and safety of the people. Mr Olufemi Adeniyi, Chairman, Ogun Interim Committee on Transportation, stated that there had been cordial relationship between the committee and the transport unions since the inception of the present administration. Also speaking, the Chairman, Tunes Communication, Tunde Oladunjoye, who frowned at the rate of accidents in the state, said that the purpose of the seminar was to educate vehicle operators on road safety.
