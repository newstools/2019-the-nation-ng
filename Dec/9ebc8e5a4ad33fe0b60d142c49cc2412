 A former gubernatorial aspirants on the platform of All Progressives Congress(APC) in Kogi State, Gen Patrick Ademu Akpa , has urged Nigerians to be positive about the new year. Gen Akpa said 2020 “will favour the country and her people more than 2019″. He stated this in a New Year message, signed by his media Aide, Pastor John Desmond, on Tuesday. Akpa said: “No nation grows with the citizenry being negative about the progress of such a nation.” He said Nigerians should see light at the end of the tunnel over the nation’s politics, economy, unity and development. Akpa insisted that 2019 was not a bad year, when properly scrutinised. He said: “Nigerians must be grateful to God for His goodness in 2019, as well as pray that the current year will be far better than the previous year.” He enjoined Kogi people to join hands with the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello to continue to work for the good of Kogi state.
