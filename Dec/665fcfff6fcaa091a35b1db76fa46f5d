The Edo State Skills Development Agency (EdoJobs) in partnership with ACT Nigeria, has trained not less than 130 youths in the three senatorial districts of the state on Information and Communication Technonolgy (ICT) in furtherance of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration’s technology innovation drive. Head, EdoJobs, Mrs. Ukinebo Dare, in a chat with journalists said the training held in Benin, Irrua, Auchi and Ekpoma, with each center training 33 people. According to her, “We have had a sustained relationship with ACT Nigeria, our technical partners on this project, who have been instrumental in developing and training youths under its Digital Village initiative. “Basically, what happens is that the partner, which is involved in providing telecommunication services, trains the youths in the ICT centers that have been built in suburban and rural areas across the state. The training equips youths with skills and expertise to pursue careers in science and technology, providing them with the needed insight to engage and enrich themselves in the ICT-dominated digital world.” She added that a number of the youths turned up for the trainings at the four locations, after learning of the exploits of the last batch of trainees on the programme. The partnership between EdoJobs and ACT Nigeria is anchored on the government’s drive to deploy technology innovation in engaging and empowering youths in the state. Most of the works are coordinated from the Edo Innovation Hub, a facility that houses a number of tech-focused firms operating in the state, where young people learn and work on projects on healthcare, education, energy, fintech, agritech, human resources and many more.
