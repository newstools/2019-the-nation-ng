By Kolade Adeyemi, Kano As from January, 2020 persons of opposite sexes would no longer be allowed to board the same commercial tricycles in Kano State. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje made this known at the closing ceremony of the 77th annual Islamic vacation course, (IVC)organised by Zone A of Muslim society of Nigeria, (MSSN) at Bayero University, Kano. He said that the directive will take effect from January, 2020. Ganduje, who was represented by the Commander General of Hisbah Board,Harun lbn- sins, explained that the measure was meant to uphold the Islamic values as well as curb immorality in the society. Former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau introduced the commercial tricycle transportation system, following the inconveniences experienced by women boarding the same tricycle with their male counterparts. But, after Shekarauâ€™s tenure, it became business as usual, as tricycle operators began to lift males and females in the same tricycles.
