The Delta State Police Command on Wednesday confirmed the killing of four suspected pirates along the creeks of Burutu Local Government. Spokesman DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya said one escaped with bullet injuries. He told The Nation on the phone that “five of them were gunned down. But one escaped with bullet wounds. The other four were taken to hospital. On the way, they died. They were unidentified pirates.” Over 10 riverine communities along the Ramos River had been reportedly terrorised by suspected pirates, who besides stealing and kidnapping, also raped women. The gang was also said to lay ambush for passenger boats. Their onslaught had for the past four months caused tension among residents. The Nation learnt that a mobile police team of the Delta State Government Waterways Security gunned down the suspects when they (suspects) wanted to attack them. It was gathered that the five-man gang had attacked a boat heading for Burutu from Warri early yesterday, robbing passengers of their goods and money. The hoodlums attempted to hijack another incoming boat, which unknown to them, had security personnel dressed in mufti, who opened fire on them. While one escaped, the other four died while being rushed to the Central Hospital, Warri.
