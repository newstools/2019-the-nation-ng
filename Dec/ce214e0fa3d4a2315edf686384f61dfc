Emma Elekwa, Onitsha Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) has appeal to the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) to establish Drivers Fitness Units in all parks across the country. Chairman, Anambra state chapter, Comrade Vincent Ezekwueme made the call on Friday in Onitsha when executive members of South East Educational Vanguard paid him a sympathy visit on his survival from a ghastly auto accident recently. He said the unit has become necessary to ascertain the soundness of drivers both in minds and characters before being permitted to convey passengers to their destinations. He also canvassed the withdrawal of license of reckless drivers which he said would go a long way in reducing cases of accidents on the nation’s roads. Ezekwueme urged Nigerians to be their brothers’ keepers, including donating to Funds for Indigents Patient and for them to embrace National Health Insurance Scheme. He said, “Nigerians should ensure they do the right things at all times to make our good better and our better best as desideratum towards actualisation of Nigeria of our dreams, hopes and yearnings. “Except life is lived for others it is not worth living. Imperatively of use to the world is the only way to happiness and achievements which could be possible only if you and I keep right and do the right things. The CLO boss also called on the government and the governed to ensure unprecedented patriotism, selfless commitment and sacrifices towards nation building. “We must through words and actions abhor and discard bitterness, rancour and injustices,” he added.
