President of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Ibrahima Gusau, has vowed to surrender himself for probe to anti-graft agencies, the EFCC and the ICPC, over allegation of possible forgery in the five-year deal signed with Germany-based sportswear, PUMA. He also said the denial of the former secretary of the federation, Ademu Elijah, over the deal would not bother him as the signatures were there for verification. Gusau told our correspondent on Friday that having submitted himself to the anti-graft agencies when the missing IAAF overpayment was investigated, he would be ready to do so again. He said: “I don’t think at this level I should be afraid to surrender myself for probe to the anti-graft agencies, because I did that when the issue of IAAF overpayment came up. “So I am ready for any probe whatsoever. If the former secretary denied he was not aware of the Puma deal, I think that is his own personal problem because the signatures were there to verify his claims.” He added: “If you convert $2.7m to naira, you can imagine how much we have saved this country from spending on kit which will later end in the hands of some people. “We have done this in line with President Muhammad Buhari’s stance on attracting corporate bodies and private sector partnership. “For us, we have done this in good faith, believing that we would not be bothered about what our athletes wear for major events and for four years, all this will be taken care of with the deal. “I think what has been the major concern is that we have done this to stop people from hiding under the business of using government money to buy kits for teams during major events.”
