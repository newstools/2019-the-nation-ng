 The crisis rocking the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has gotten messier as former President of the federation; Solomon Ogba has raised alarm over the N850m released by the Presidency for the staging of the 2018 Africa Senior Athletics Championships held in Asaba, Delta State. Ogba had been questioned over the $150,000 released for the tournament by the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA). Ogba who was the Chairman of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) of 2018 Africa Senior Athletics Championships described as untrue that AFN the sum of  $150,000 was released to the AFN  from CAA for the event according to a statement released yesterday  through his  media adviser  Olukayode Thomas. He, however, explained that the money from the CAA was explicitly given to the LOC to assist in the hosting of the continental championships and was never meant for the AFN as erroneously suggested. To Ogba, it is a global norm that when cities are to host important events, governing and continental bodies give monetary and technical assistance to support the LOC, so the $150,000 was assistance for the LOC not AFN. Ogba who reportedly  resigned from the AFN board yesterday, wondered why AFN should be blamed while  those fuelling the crisis were silent over the N850m released to the Sports Ministry to support the African Championships. “As at today, neither the LOC of Asaba 2018 nor anyone from Delta State has been informed about what happened to the N850m the Sports Ministry requested from the Presidency for Asaba 2018,” Ogba noted. Ogba refused to rescind his decision to quit AFN, adding that the undue interference in the AFN board is unbearable. He lamented that several attempts have been made to impeach the incumbent President of AFN, Shehu Gusau which he described as desperation, unfair, unjust and uncalled for.
