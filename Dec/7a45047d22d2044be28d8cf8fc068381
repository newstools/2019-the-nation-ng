 An Ebute Metta Chief Magistrates’ Court on Thursday remanded a 48-year-old dismissed policeman, Edwin Apalowo Ola, for allegedly killing a 27-year-old-man, Malik Mohammed, at a nightclub, Crest Inn Club, Oshodi. When the defendant was brought before the court, Chief Magistrate M.A. Ajiferuke, did not take his plea. Magistrate Ajiferuke ordered that Ola be remanded at the Nigeria Correctional Services custody for 30 days, pending advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Prosecuting Insp. Raphael Donney, had earlier told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 29 at about 8.05 pm at the  Club located on Balogun Street, Oshodi. He alleged that the dismissed police inspector shot Mohammed with a gun on the head, causing him instant death. The case continues on January 27. It would be recalled that the dismissed  police inspector was among a team of policemen who were dispatched to the club in response  to a complaint made by one Omowunmi Makinde, who said that she was being assaulted in the Club. Lagos State Commisioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu had ordered the arrest and detention of officers involved in the shooting incident. Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), Lagos State, DSP Bala Elkana, had listed other officers involved in the shooting incident as  Insp. Orubu Olusola,  Kasai Sule, Sgt. Momoh Ogwuche and Sgt. Adoga Collins attached to Akinpelu Division. He said they trying to effect an arrest, they were attacked by some hoodlums which necessitated their use of Firearms. Elkana said their action fell short of the provision of Force Order 237 which defined the circumstances in which a Police Officer will be justified to use his Firearms and the use of Force.
