Our Reporter  SINCE December 1, traffic has improved tremendously on the Kara bridge end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. But that is not to say all is well on the entire stretch of the road. Those living around Magboro, Ibafo and Mowe have tales of woe to tell. Moving out of Mowe to link the Long Bridge has been tough in the past few weeks. So also is the return journey. Those living in Arepo are caught in the traffic web at night and it is not funny at all. At times, the gridlock starts from the middle of the Long Bridge and stretches all the way to Magboro.  The people’s joy at the opening of the Kara bridge axis after its repair has been dampened by the heavy traffic they go through every night around Wawa, Arepo, Magboro down to Ibafo. I pray that Julius Berger does something to ease motorists’ pains during the Yuletide.
