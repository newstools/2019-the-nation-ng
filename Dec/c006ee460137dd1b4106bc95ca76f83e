The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mr. Ibrahim Magu on Wednesday said the agency has secured 1,070 convictions within 11 months this year. He also said the EFCC will collaborate with others to strengthen Asset Recovery and Management to support the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Magu made the disclosures at the opening of a two-day High Level Conference on Fast-Tracking the Implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) in Support of the Development Goals at the State House Banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said: “It is instructive to state that the last four years have been remarkable for the EFCC, especially in stolen asset recovery through conviction and non-conviction-based forfeitures. The cumulative value of recoveries by the Commission runs into hundreds of billions of Naira. “We have secured unprecedented convictions in the history of this country. The conviction figures are as follows: 2015-103; 2016 – 189; 2017 – 190;  2018 – 312. Between January and November 30, 2019, we secured 1,070 convictions and we are still counting. “The recent arrest and prosecution of a social media celebrity and other internet fraudsters was a landmark achievement in the sustained fight against internet-related frauds and money laundering in the country.” Magu said the battle against corruption has just begun until Nigeria is free of the menace. He added: “I also wish to state that the zeal to tackle the menace of corruption headlong has begun and we will leave no stone unturned until we kill corruption in Nigeria for better tomorrow. “It is important to note that UNCAC is one of the key legally binding universal anti-corruption instruments with about 186 countries as signatories including Nigeria.”
