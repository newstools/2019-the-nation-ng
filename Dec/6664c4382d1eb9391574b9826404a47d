The quality of friends around you goes a long way in shaping your happiness and growth in life. Tara Durotoye has shown to children’s book author and founding publisher of Clever Clogs Books, Olubunmi Talabi, that she is a friend in need and indeed. For her recent birthday celebration, Talabi’s friends, led by Durotoye and Media & Communications Consultant, Omawumi Ogbe, held a cocktail party. Durotoye stressed on the importance of letting people know they have done well and the importance of celebrating people while they are still here. Ogbe added, “Talabi had an amazing year with the success of her bestselling book, Why Do You Wash Your Hands?, which is not just the first Nigerian children’s picture book to be published in 4 different languages but one that sold out in less than 4 weeks “Mrs T (her nickname) went on to host the biggest and most successful WIMBIZ annual conference in the history of the organisation to date. We put this event together to say to her ‘well done’ after two impactful years as WIMBIZ Chairperson. We also appreciate all that she’s been doing to promote child literacy in Nigeria.” Talabi, who became quite emotional, shared on social media: “Some people are gifted with lovely ideas. This is what comes to mind when I think of Tara Durotoye and Omawumi. Ladies, thank you for dreaming up this garden party, celebrating life, celebrating friendship, celebrating achievements. Your words are still ringing in my ears: why wait till someone is no longer with you before you tell them how much they mean to you, before you express your appreciation of them before you tell them how their life has made a difference. Tara, Omawumi, I appreciate you. Thank you. Your efforts have made a difference. Words cannot express how grateful I am to all my family and friends who braved the traffic and juggled multiple priorities to be there.”
