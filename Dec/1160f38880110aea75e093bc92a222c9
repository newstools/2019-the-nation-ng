The Immediate past governor of Ekiti state, Mr. Ayodele Fayose has pleaded to the aggrieved members of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to forgive him of all his iniquities when in office. Fayose urged the aggrieved members to sheathe swords against him, embrace his peace initiative and work together with unity of purpose and togetherness to relaunch the party to prominence in the state. The former governor spoke on Tuesday in his Afao-Ekiti countryhome while addressing party members across the 16 local government areas and the 177 wards in the state. He expressed confidence that the party will soon regain its lost glory ahead of future elections in the state, noting the strength of the party would be restored after members would have settled their differences. While explaining that creating different groups within the party would not be the best option, however assured that all issues and tendencies would be resolved for the party to reclaim the state from the All Progressive Congress. Fayose, however, congratulated Senator Biodun Olujimi on her victory at the appellate court as the lawmaker representing Ekiti South senatorial district, saying she remains one of the leaders of the party in the state. He regretted the violence and alleged electoral malpractices that marred the last saturday’s local government election where a member of the party, Forum Kosedake was allegedly killed by political thugs. He noted that the leadership of PDP was warned not to not participate in the poll knowing fully well the ‘antics’ of the APC-led government in the state. “Everybody should come back to the party. I am open to reconciliation. If Senator Biodun Olujimi call you for meeting tomorrow, go there and listen to her. All of us are leaders, don’t let us factionalize this party.
