Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu has reiterated his commitment to youth development and inclusion in the state. He made this charge during the maiden convocation of Mountain Top University, Ogun State,  on Friday.
In his lecture entitled : “The future of job and the world of work: The need for graduates that are globally competitive,” noted that Lagos State truly cherishes the potential of the youth in the state and is committed to support them fully. “I must reiterate that Lagos State truly appreciates the inherent potential of young people in the state. Indeed, young people resident in Lagos today constitute a rare window of opportunity that we cannot afford to squander. I’m pleased  to let you know that earlier this month I launched  a Technology Innovation Fund to support young people of Lagos State. This is just the beginning, we will do much more in 2020
“We will continue to support the entrepreneurial aspirations of our young people through such initiatives as the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) and the Ready-Set-Work programme,” he added. Speaking on the importance of curriculum transformation and technology, Sanwo-Olu  said that no progress will be made if outdated curricula is used in our education system. “ We will not progress in the 21st century using 20th century curricula. Our young people must be comfortable with coding, robotics and other technologies from an early age, especially in the public school system. Regardless of what academic track our students are on, technological literacy must be a common denominator,” he noted. He advised them to be adaptable to change and disruption noting that what they have learnt  will  become archaic before the completion of their youth service programme. “University graduates will need to be fully prepared, they will need to be educated in the tools and the languages of the world of work to be able to compete with others in the quest for employment,” he added.
