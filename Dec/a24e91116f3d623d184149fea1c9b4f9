Nicholas Kalu, Abuja Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the Department of State Services (DSS) to release Revolution Now Convener, Omoyele Sowore, within 24 hours. The DSS has on a couple of occasions acknowledged that it had received an earlier court order to release Sowore but said they could not just let him go without proper documentation to the appropriate sureties. Justice Ojukwu, also awarded a N100, 000 fine against the DSS over its delay to serve the defence counsel with additional proof of evidence in the ongoing trial of Sowore and Olawale Bakare. The judge, who seemed piqued, said the fine must be paid to the defendants before the next adjourned date of December 6, 2019.
