MTN Pulse House Invasion surprised a lucky fan in Owerri, Imo State, Aguoha Grace Favour, by throwing her a party. Her day went from 0 to 100 when African Dj of the year 2019, Sodamola Oluseye ‘DJ Spinall’ Desmond, and music star, Owoh Chimaobi ‘Zoro’  Chrismathner surprised her by arriving unannounced with an entourage befitting of royalty, while cheers from neighbors, friends and bystanders filled the air. Afterwards, the celebrities shocked Grace with an out-of-this-world party and swiftly, the space was redecorated into a disco-themed house party.  When the initial shock had worn off, she got right into taking photos to capture the moment, taking part in some multitasking by inviting more friends to join the party. The party kicked off and everyone had a fun and entertaining evening. The highlight was when DJ Spinall changed the game with his amazing mix. She also got a framed photo autographed by DJ Spinall, Zoro and the MTN Pulse team. MTN Pulse is an empowerment and fun-dispensing avenue for the young people.
