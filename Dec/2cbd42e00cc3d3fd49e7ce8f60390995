The Lagos State Science Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC) is ready to actualise the dream of the state government to turn Lagos to a technology hub as quickly as possible. The leader of the 16-member council, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday that the group would spring into action not later than the first week of February next year by conducting a training for about 30 participants on hololens. The hololens is a virtual reality headset with transparent lenses for augmented reality experience. He said: “Before now, the council had focused on the research aspect only, but now the focus will shift to not just research but innovation and other skills development,” Ogundipe said. “We are going to kick start by organising a train-the-trainers workshop with Microsoft toward the last week of January or first week in February. “We will be having participants drawn from the Lagos State University (LASU), the Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTEC), the University of Lagos and the Ministry of Science and Technology. “We shall also be citing our centres in these three institutions of higher learning with the aim of developing skills for the young ones.” He said that boot camps would also be organised. According to him, emphasis will be placed on training of pupils and students at both the primary and secondary school levels respectively.
