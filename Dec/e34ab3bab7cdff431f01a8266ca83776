Ex-Brother Naija housemate,  Abiri Oluwabusayomi, popularly known as Khloe has said that she cannot settle down with a man who does not have at least three cars, two houses and two stable businesses. The reality television star took to her Instagram page on Thursday,  December 12, 2019 to reveal this.  In a long post, Khloe made it clear that it is her personal decision as she does not plan to bring into the world kids who would not enjoy all the good things of life. Khloe posted: “So last night at dinner I was having a conversation with the girls and I said I can’t MARRY a broke man that doesn’t have at least 3 cars, 2 houses, and 2 stable businesses …. so it got online and people are insulting me …  1. That’s my wish, not yours. 2. I repeat I’m not bringing a child into this world if my husband and me are not financially stable. 3. It’s me that knows what I went through growing up and I don’t wish that for my children. 4. I have half of these things, so why should I go lower. 5. It’s none of your goddam business what I wish for,” she wrote. She went on to advise ladies not to settle for less and also advises men who would insult her for the post to keep their poverty to themselves.
