To resolve the lingering feud between Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole, monarchs in the state will embark on a praying and fasting session. The Edo Council of Traditional Rulers said it will begin the exercise on January 2 to seek God’s intervention in the ongoing crisis. The two gladiators have refused to shift grounds despite efforts to settle their dispute. The governor rejected the party’s reconciliation committee, saying Oshiomhole remained suspended. One of the monarchs, the Otaru of Auchi, Aliru Momoh, in a statement by his spokesman Usman Abudah, urged the Muslim ummah in his kingdom to continue to pray for peace in the state. Abudah said the monarch announced the prayer plan while briefing members of Otaru-in-Council (OIC) on the outcome of a meeting of the state Traditional Rulers’ Council. The Council meeting was presided over by the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II. Momoh enjoined the entire kingdom to also support the efforts of the royal fathers, “as prayers are never too much and nobody knows whose prayers the Almighty will accept”.
