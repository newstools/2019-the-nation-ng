Last Saturday, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, played a role that is different from his current official duty. The top legal practitioner’s niece, Mariam, married his sweetheart, Desmond Ike. After a traditional wedding ceremony held in Delta, a Lagos reception was held at Decorum Event Centre, Oregun, Ikeja. Keyamo, who took in Mariam as his daughter since she was 13, said: “This is an important day for me because this is like a test run for the many daughters that I have. She is my daughter too because she was brought to me when she was barely 13 or so. Her father is the first child of my father’s family but she calls me uncle. “In a way I can’t explain, she has found favours in my eyes and she has been very helpful to my house and chamber.” Regardless of the bond shared with the bribe, the minister warned that there was no room for her in his house any longer once she failed to make her marriage work. He stated: “Desmond has married a hardworking girl and he needs to take care of her. I have told her privately that she must respect her husband. If a woman respects a man, you can get him to do many things. “My father set a policy that his married daughters could only visit him if their husbands gave the consent. There was a time my sister visited him and my father asked her for the husband’s letter permitting the journey. She couldn’t provide it and she was sent back to Port Harcourt. So, you shouldn’t think you have a place to come back to because you have started a new life and you must make Desmond’s house your home. Sharing problems with people is the major cause of failed marriages. I have done more than 150 divorce cases, so I am talking from experience.” Keyamo didn’t spare the groom as well, saying he didn’t know he had another plan when he came to his chamber as a client. He said he was surprised when Desmond kept visiting despite the fact that they had concluded their business.
