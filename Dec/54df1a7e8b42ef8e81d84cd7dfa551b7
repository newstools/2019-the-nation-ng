Taofeek Babalola  Enyimba coach Usman Abd’Allah has admitted that his side has a lot to do to qualify for the quarter final as they face San Pedro FC of Cote d’ Ivoire in tomorrow’s CAF Confederation Cup fixture at the Enyimba Stadium at 2pm. The Peoples’ Elephants are seeking a quick response after a disappointing 0-2 loss in their group D opener against Hassania Agadir last weekend left the team bottom of the group’s standing. Speaking ahead of the encounter, Abd’Allah believes his boys’ right attitude in the training would propel them to victory. “The players understand that there’s a lot of task ahead of us,” Abd’Allah said. “We’ve spoken to them about the loss (against Hassania) and we all understand the situation we are in and the attitude in training is positive. I’m happy with their response and their attitude in training. “This competition is always about winning and everyone is gearing up to qualify for the quarter-final. And we’re expecting them to come very strong that is why we’re not leaving any stone unturned and taking anything for granted. We are working hard to see that we counter whatever they come in with. “The main goal is to get the three points. If it comes with some bonus of goals it will go a long way. But I think the three points is very important so that we can put ourselves back in the race.”
