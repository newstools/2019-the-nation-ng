 PayAttitude global last week celebrated children at the Olikoye Ransome Kuti Emergency center of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital(LUTH) with donations of Educational materials. The project was in partnership with 9IJa Kids and an ongoing ‘My Reality Initiative’ programme led by Dr. Yemi Osinake of LUTH. The Group Head PayAttitude, Onajite Regha said: “Today we have partnered with 9ija kids to share some love for the children that are here at the LUTH, we have activity books, three in a kit which we would be giving to the children and just to make the season joyous for them. Pay attitude always looks for different initiatives every year but we choose to adopt this one this year. We are sharing books for them so they can have fun even while on admission so they can have something to look for because pay attitude stands for hope, convenience and joy for everybody that uses it,” she said
