 Gunmen at the weekend killed a middle-aged member of a vigilance group working with a company in Ikere-Ekiti, the headquarters of Ikere Local Government Area of Ekiti State. It was gathered that the incident occurred on Saturday night at a quarry located on the Ikere-Iju-Akure road, when the hoodlums invaded the firm to steal. The Nation learnt that three vigilance group members had been stationed at the quarry for more than six months to prevent robbery. Narrating his ordeal, one of the night guards, who was lucky to escape from the scene, said the gunmen came at night. He said: “The robbers shot the leader of the vigilance group, while the other member was tied with a rope. “The robbers stole electric cables and other items.” The Commandant of the vigilance group, Mr. Akin Olounloni, confirmed the incident, but said the vigilante was killed by suspected cultists. He said: “The deceased had earlier called me to report that some cultists threatened to kill him after he reprimanded them. “When he called me, I told him to report the case to the police in Ikere. He went there, the boys were invited and the issue was settled, only for me to receive a call that the man was killed overnight.” Olounloni said the suspects have been arrested and are with the State Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). Police spokesman Sunday Abutu could not be reached for comment, as his phone was switched off. But SARS’ Commander in Ekiti, Mr. Marcus Ogundola, confirmed that three suspects have been arrested. “We have arrested three suspects, but investigation is still on. We cannot say for now whether they were the real perpetrators, but we are investigating the killing,” he said.
