 A High Court in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, has sentenced Mrs Agnes Nwefuru to death by hanging for killing her co-wife and seven children. The state government had accused Nwefuru of setting ablaze the house of Mrs Felicia Nwefuru, which took her life and those of her seven children. Delivering the judgement, Justice Uwabunkonye Onwosi declared that the plaintiff proved that the defendant was guilty of the murder charge preferred against her. “Nwefuru Agnes is found guilty of murder and is hereby convicted. The term of her sentence is that she be hanged by the neck until she is dead,” the judge ruled.
