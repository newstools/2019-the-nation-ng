By Tolulope Oni Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger was a subject to racist abuse in the Blues victory against London side Tottenham Hotspur. The Chelsea defender was furious with fans after hearing monkey noises and gestures against him. Immediately, Chelsea captain Azpilicueta informed match official, Anthony Taylor of this behaviour by fans to make a stop to the match due to racist chants. In the game, Chelsea FC outclassed their rivals Tottenham Hotspur by two goals to nil in an entertaining match fixture on Sunday. Blues striker, Willian helped his side grab all three points by getting a brace in the first half. The Brazilian striker scored early in the game by putting the ball past Spurs keeper, Gazanigga in the bottom right corner to give his side the lead. He also doubled the lead late to the end of first half by scoring from the penalty spot after a bizzare challenge by Tottenham’s goalkeeper on Marcos Alonso. He converted the penalty by sending the keeper the wrong way. Tottenham have released a statement that racism is “completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our stadium.” The club’s statement reads: “Following an alleged incident of racism at today’s fixture against Chelsea, the club has issued the following statement. “We are now conducting a thorough investigation which will include liaising with Chelsea and their players for their observations. “Any form of racism is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our stadium. “We take any such allegations extremely seriously and shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to be behaving in such a way, including stadium bans.”
