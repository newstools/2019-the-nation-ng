The grand finale of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) Tobacco Control Rap Challenge took place at the weekend in Lagos and was attended by tobacco control advocates and youth groups. The competition, which started on September 2, 2019, targeted creating awareness on enforcement of the National Tobacco Control (NTC) Act 2015 and Tobacco Regulations to the youths through a music competition tagged #TCRapChallenge and #EnforceTCRegNow. Provisions of the NTC Act that the campaign promoted are the ban on sale of cigarettes in single sticks and ban on sale of cigarettes to minors. The winner of the competition was Lagos-based Okuguni Efemena Ferdinand, who received a cash gift of N150, 000 (One hundred and fifty thousand naira). First runner up was Udeng Bennet Etido based in Enugu who received N100, 000 (One hundred thousand naira). Adeogun Joy Yinka based in Oyo, Atiku Godswill Goddy from Abuja and Udeng Otobong Bennet from Anambra each got N50, 000 (Fifty thousand naira). The TCRap Challenge, according to the ERA/ FoEN social media officer, Adewunmi Adeniyi, “is a reflection of ERA/FoEN’s belief that the youth are crucial in tobacco control. From the diversity of the winners, it can be concluded that Nigerian youths yearn for effective regulation of tobacco products and reject tobacco industry attempts to conscript them into the smoking habit. “Our knowledge of how the tobacco industry targets the youths made us conceive this initiative to reach the same audience that the tobacco industry targets as replacement smokers.” The winners, he said, will get studio sessions, tobacco control branded T-shirts, phones and cash prizes, among other gifts. We are happy that the youths targeted by tobacco companies have demonstrated through music that despite the tobacco industry strategies to grow replacement smokers, they can make the right choices,” said the Deputy Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi.
