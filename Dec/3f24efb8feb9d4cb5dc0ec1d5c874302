Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti state commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Mr. Solomon Iyamu said two herdsmen were arrested on Tuesday for invading farmlands with cows in the state. The NSCDC boss said the arrest of the suspects were made possible through a joint operation of the Agro Rangers Unit of the command, Nigeria Army, Police, Ekiti State Anti-Grazing Agency and men of Vigilante Group of Nigeria (GVN). The operation which he said lasted for about six hours along took place at Ago Aduloju and Ogbese axis of Ise-Orun and Gbonyin local government areas of the state. Iyamu explained that the herdsmen were arrested following a tip off that herders had invaded some farms along Ado/Ijan in search of pasture to feed their cows. He added that the arrested herdsmen will be charge to court as soon as investigation is completed, appealing to farmers in Ekiti to continue to be law abiding and always report any perceived herdersâ€™ threat to the men of Agro Rangers Unit for prompt action. He, however, lauded the Joint Operations for the collaborative work, urging them not to relent in the discharge of their mandates. He equally commended the NSCDC Commandant General, Abdullah Muhammadu for his decisive efforts geared towards solving farmers/herders clash across the country through the establishment of Agro-Rangers Unit.
