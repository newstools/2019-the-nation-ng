The Minister for Youths and Sports, Solomon Dalung has praised the management of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) for maintaining sporting facilities in the institution. Dalung made the remark last Monday after touring sporting facilities at the institution. The minister said the purpose of his visit was to ascertain the level of the state’s preparedness towards hosting the 2020 National Sports Festival. Dalung, who was received by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Faraday Orunmwense, along with principal officers of the university, appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to call off the ongoing strike so that students could return to school. Speaking on the importance of sports to societal development, Dalung highlighted the achievements of the administration in the area of sports to include reintroduction of the Nation Sports Festival six years after it was last held. He urged the university management to keep up the good work it was doing in sports, adding that his ministry was aware of the exploits UNIBEN students were achieving in International competitions. Responding, Orunmwense thanked the minister for the visit and said he was appreciative that the Minister was impressed with the sporting facilities available. “Over the past seven years, UNIBEN has hosted major national sporting events and at every point, improved on the standard of facilities available. Little wonder we are known as the university with the best sports facility in Nigeria. We are ready to support the state government in organising the 2020 National Sports festival in Edo State. ‘’We will improve on the standard of facilities available before then”. The University Director of Sports, Dr Felicia Igbase, presented an award of excellence to Dalung for supporting UNIBEN in sports.
