The lawmaker representing Ovia Federal Constituency, Omosede Igbinedion, has organised a football competition to scout for best players to be sponsored abroad. Omosede said the football talent hunt was in collaboration with a licensed FIFA agent, Mr. Andrew Uyi, who is based in the United Kingdom. She said it has been difficult to secure jobs for youths under the ruling All Progressives Congress and as such she had to look for other ways to create opportunities for them Omosede said the situation would change if Nigerians elect Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in next month’s general election adding that the football competition she organised to scout for skillful youths in her constituency was to enable her sponsor them abroad for lucrative deals. The lawmaker, who is seeking to return to the House of Representatives under the PDP, said: “We hope that Atiku will win the election because that would mean jobs for the youths. It is difficult to get jobs for them under Buhari. “Sometimes it is not education that drives a man. It might be other things like extra curricular activities and sports. Whatever your passion is you should follow it through. “I believe footballers are not only able to affect their immediate families when they are given the opportunity to go abroad but they also affect their communities and their country. It has a great effect on everybody and the society at large gets the benefits. I remember when Mikel Obi started here.” Uyi, the UK based FIFA licensed football agent, promised to ensure that the players get juicy deals abroad.
