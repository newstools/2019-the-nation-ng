The Victoria Island chapter of Junior Chamber International ( JCI ) has launched IpledgeNigeria campaign, an initiative to re-awaken the consciousness of Nigerians to be more committed to nation-building. The campaign launched on January 1st 2019, will sensitise Nigerians on various activities that will make them to be more positively responsible to the cause of a greater Nigeria. JCI chapter President, Olamipo Adeola explained the intention of the campaign is to ignite love, passion and responsibility every citizen of Nigeria should be exhibiting. “I know Nigeria is not where we all want it to be but it’s our Nigeria and we must consciously get involved, else nothing would change,” she charged. She believes that Nigerians all over the world should join the movement and hold the government accountable. She reaffirmed the responsibilities and involvement of youths in affairs of the state and politics were very crucial to national development. “We would be advocating for active youths participation in government at various levels,” she said. She added “IpledgeNigeria” campaign is taking off strategically at this time the nation is preparing for general elections. “Citizens will be voting to elect their leaders into various offices and Nigerians must be aware, that with our PVCs, we are responsible for the candidate we elect and how our nation would be for the next four years. “Citizens will be sensitised on their duties before, during and after the election, as we will be advocating for zero tolerance against violence, vote buying or selling and any act that may hinder a free and fair election. Adeola noted stakeholders, both in private and public sectors, celebrities, entertainers, passionate citizens will be encouraged and engaged to endorse the initiative and also propagate the agenda of the programme.
