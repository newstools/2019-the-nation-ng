Nigeria born South African based saxophonist, Femi Koya, has disclosed plans to return to Nigeria relaunch his music. In a recent chat in Lagos, Koya who is known on the South African Afro Beat circuit, revealed his plans to break into the Nigerian music which is globally rated. “Nigeria music is rated high and not too many people do my kind of music at the moment,” said Koya. “I believed in the culture and heritage of Nigeria, that Nigeria is the future of the world and so it’s necessary that I should come home whether I am accepted or not. I play Nigerian music and represent authentic Africa and there is future in Music in Nigeria. “Nigeria has enough of culture to show to the world but there are few people in the space to showcase our heritage. No enough young people in the space to take Nigeria music to the next level.” Mostly referred to as the new face of African renaissance, Koya’s music combines West African highlife and jazz, South African Sofiatown with Afrobeat root sounds and contemporary groove.
