A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress  (APC) in the Ayobo Ipaja Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Otunba Ladi Oluwaloni Olo, has hailed the Operation Zero Tolerance initiatives of Lagos State Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu. He urged residents to support the emergency declarations on waste and traffic management, “as they are for the benefit of all.” Olo, who spoke on Friday in Ipaja, Lagos, while responding to the issue raised by the governor over the return of the Environmental Sanitation Day, noted that the idea of bringing back the exercise was something Lagosians should give consideration devoid of sentiments. He enjoined them to trust his leadership and that of Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat to take the state to a greater height through their decisions. Olo, a chartered accountant, praised APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for always giving the state the best leadership that could not be found anywhere. He congratulated the newly appointed Chief of Staff to the Governor, Mr Tayo Ayinde, and described him as a round peg in a round hole. On the recent inauguration of the House of Assembly by the governor, Olo assured the people of Ayobo Ipaja and by extension Alimosho that the robust representation they enjoyed from Bisi Yusuf and the newly sworn in legislator, Kehinde Joseph, would continue. He sought support and cooperation for the lawmakers.
