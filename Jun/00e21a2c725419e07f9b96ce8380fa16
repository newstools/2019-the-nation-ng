SEQUEL to an Executive Order by Lagos State Governor Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on refuse clearing, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has begun an intensive waste evacuation operation tagged: “Lagos at 4am”, to tackle the menace of improper waste disposal in the metropolis. In a statement yesterday, LAWMA said it had begun the early morning operation to fast-track the process of restoring environmental sustainabi-lity in Lagos. “We have embarked on this operation to restore the state to the path of cleanliness and environmental sustainability. This early morning operation starts by 4am; we roll out our operational vehicles at strategic locations across the metropolis to sanitise the environment and mitigate waste challenges.” The statement said LAWMA will not leave any stone unturned in its quest to clean up black spots across the state. It urged Lagosians to support state government’s efforts by avoiding indiscriminate dumping of waste and patronise their assigned PSP operator. It reiterated its commitment to tackling environmental degradation in Apapa caused by the inaccessibility of the road for waste evacuation. It further stated that restoring the environment in Apapa was what the authority had to do to make the environment livable for residents and those who carry out their business transactions there.
