The Management of Ekiti State University has postponed the first semester examination scheduled to commence on Monday. The examination was postponed to July 1st after a protest by students of the institution, who claimed that they were not given enough time to prepare. The students, who had earlier held a congress where it resolved to call for an extension of the examination, gathered at the satellite gate of the institution to express their grievances. According to them, some students who were supposed to sit for examinations on Monday still sat for test on Sunday evening, saying such was absurd in an academic environment. They claimed that the action of the institution was to deliberately lure students to failure, which may force some of them to commit suicide. It was gathered the decision was reached after the management had a marathon meeting with the institution’s Student Union Government (SUG). According to a statement by institution’s Registrar, Mr Akin Arogundade in Ado-Ekiti on Sunday, the new date for the examination was chosen to ensure security of lives and properties on campus and its environs. Atogundade said all academic activities on campus have been postponed till Monday 1st July while students are expected back on campus on June 30. He added all students preparing for exams should ensure payment of all necessary fees, saying evidence of payment would be used for clearance and examination permit.
