A United Kingdom-based businessman, Mr. Monday Ohuimuwen, has said that many of his business partners coming to Nigeria for genuine businesses have been deported because of what he termed misleading guidelines on the entry Visa on arrival programme posted on the Nigeria Immigration Portal. Monday said the Norwegians and British nationals he invited based on the information contained in the Nigeria Immigration Portal, regarding Entry Visa on Arrival Programme were deported on arrival at the Murtala Mohammed Airport, Lagos. Speaking to reporters in Bénin-City, Monday, who is engaged in distributive business said the Immigration authorities were supposed to allow in invited business partners who had followed the guidelines. Monday said they were deported under very flimsy excuses that they ought to have gotten approval in their home country before traveling to Nigeria.
