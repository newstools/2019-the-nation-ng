Lekki Concession Company Limited (LCC) has reiterated its commitment to support indigenes of Eti-Osa as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR). The Managing Director of the company, Mr Mubashiru Hassan, gave this assurance on Thursday while presenting a cheque to the executives of the Eti-Osa Indigenes’ Forum for the purchase of the General Certificate of Examination (GCE) forms to 50 indigenes of Eti-Osa Local Government Area. Hassan said the donation of the forms was part of his administration’s commitment to support indigenes, most especially indigent students of the Eti- Osa Local Government Area in secondary schools in the state towards their educational development. He said that in the last few years the company had impacted on the lives of the people in its catchment areas through the execution of various projects along the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe corridor as part of its corporate social responsibility programmes. “This gesture is part of the company’s resolve to give back to the communities in our catchment areas. What we require from them is their co-operation to achieve the aims and objectives of the company in the areas of a smooth flow of traffic and security of lives and property on the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe expressway,” he said. He advised the executives of the Eti-Osa Indigenes Forum to spread the distribution of the forms to all the communities in the local government area in order to foster unity amongst members.
