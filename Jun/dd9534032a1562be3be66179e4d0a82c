This ecosystem includes a network of 62 local suppliers, with 27 new supplier sites set up to meet the needs of the Kenitra plant. “At the heart of the Middle East and Africa region, Morocco is an historic and strategic market for our group and its four brands, Peugeot, Citroen, DS and Opel. We are forging a unique partnership in Morocco’s automotive industry, thanks to the help of all our partners and the support of the Moroccan authorities,” said Jean-Christophe Quemard, Executive VP Middle East & Africa, and member of the managing board of Groupe PSA.
