LESS than 24 hours after a Boeing 737-500 aircraft belonging to Air Peace skidded off the runway at Port Harcourt International Airport, the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) has said its investigators will retrieve the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) to ascertain the circumstances leading to the accident. This followed the visit of the investigators to the site of the accident. AIB spokesman Tunji Oketunmbi stated this yesterday in a telephone interview with The Nation. Oketunmbi said the AIB team of investigators will also interview Air Peace crew and other personnel to enable the agency get first-hand information about the circumstances that led to the accident. The spokesman said the AIB had also carried out site assessment on the aircraft to obtain relevant details critical to the probe of the accident. He said its personnel would also interface with officials of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to obtain relevant documents about the aircraft and the crew that operated the flight. According to him, the AIB has only done a preliminary investigation, as the major investigation into the cause of the accident had not begun. Also, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has removed the aircraft from the bush, some metres from the runway, for normal flight operations to continue at the airport. FAAN’s spokesperson, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, stated this in a statement. She said: “The Air Peace aircraft that overshot the runway in Port Harcourt International Airport has been removed. “The removal was facilitated by personnel of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc and Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Company.” “The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), which issued a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM), declaring the airport closed, has confirmed its re-opening for normal flights.”
