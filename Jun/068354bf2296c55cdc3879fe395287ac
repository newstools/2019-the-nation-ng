Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has appointed Dr Oluwafemi Oke-Osanyintolu as the General Manager of the State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA). A statement signed by the Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, on Thursday, said the appointment was with immediate effect. Muri-Okunola said Oke-Osanyintoluâ€™s vast experience in emergency management services at the state and federal level would serve as an advantage to enhance the performance of the agency. According to him, Osanyintolu has served at the Presidency as Senior Technical Adviser on Disaster Risk Management since 2017. The governor also approved the disengagement of Mr Babatunde Bank-Anthony as the Director General of the State Sports Commission and appointed Oluwatoyin Gafar Bolowotan as the Director-General of the commission. Muri-Okunola said the appointment is in line with the ongoing reorganisation of the State Public Service for efficient service delivery.
