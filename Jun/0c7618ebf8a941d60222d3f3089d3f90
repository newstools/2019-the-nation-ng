Embattled founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) Abuja, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, has threatened to sue celebrity photographer, Busola Dakolo, for alleging he raped her as a 16-year-old. Busola Dakolo, wife of soul singer, Timi, shocked the nation on Friday morning when he alleged Fatoyinbo raped her serially as a teenager while in Ilorin, capital of Kwara state. In the You Tube video interview he granted Chude Jideonwo, Dakolo claimed the incidents left her shattered and traumatised. The viral video attracted wide criticisms and outrage on social media with many commentators calling for Fatoyinbo’s head. But Fatoyinbo finally broke his silence on Friday evening, denying he did rape Busola or anyone for that matter. In a statement, the embattled Pastor said: “I have never in my life raped anybody, even as an unbeliever and I am absolutely innocent of this. “Busola Dakolo, who has made this false allegation and her family attended the church during the early start of the church in Ilorin in 1999. “I never had any private interactions with her beyond my pastoral duties. Looking at her status and that of her husband, I am dumbfounded why she would say such a thing.” The pastor further threatened to sue Busola Dakola for spreading damaging falsehood against him and the church. According to him: “The leadership of the church and I have briefed our lawyers to commence criminal and civil actions against all individual making such false allegations whether directly or by proxies. “We will as a church pursue every measure within the ambits of the law to bring the culprits to justice.”
