The Cross River State chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Benedict Ukpepi, has urged workers in the state to have faith that Governor Ben Ayade would implement the N30, 000 minimum wage, given that the governor who takes welfare seriously has been consistent with prompt payment of workers salaries since he assumed office. According to him, Ayade is likely going to be the first governor in the country to implement the new minimum wage. Ukpepi, who spoke with reporters at the fifth anniversary/Thanksgiving celebration and fundraising for SS Paul and Peter Catholic Church development project in Akpabuyo local government area, said there was no cause for alarm as far as the implementation of the minimum wage is concerned. “I want every worker in the state to have faith in the Governor who is being branded by the state civil servants as salary master. I know that Ayade is not going to disappoint us. His body language tells me he is ready to implement what has been passed into law,” he said. Ukpepi called on the workers to be disciplined, report to their duty posts on time and shun truancy to justify the salary they receive. Also speaking, the state chairman of the Association Senior Civil Servants in the state, Dr. Peter Ipaulo, was also hopeful that Ayade will be the first governor among the 36 states governor who will implement the new wage. Earlier in his exaltation, Rev Fr. Francis Eshiet, urged Nigerians to be alert and more security conscious to avoid falling into the hands of criminals.
