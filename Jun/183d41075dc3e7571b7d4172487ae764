 Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu will have to wait till Sunday to test real action in the ongoing Nations cup in Egypt. The 21 year old who suffered a near heart attack and has to be placed on observation by medics was declared fit to play and put on the bench against Guinea on Wednesday. He eventually got the nod to step in as replacement for Moses Simon in the 4th minute of extra time but could not into get into real action before  referee Helder Martins de Carvalho ended the match with the Eagles running away with a lone goal win thanks to Keneth Omeruo. The former Gent winger will be hoping to get another chance on Sunday not only to enjoy some action but also prove to his fans that he has indeed bounced back into super form after the setback. Wednesday’s victory has handed Eagles a ticket to the round of 16 with a match to spare. Most Nigerians who reacted after the match expressed relief that the Eagles breezed into the round of 16 without taking them through the usual permutations. Although some were not happy with wasted chances especially in the early minutes of the match, they nonetheless expressed satisfaction that the team was able to earn the needed three points to progress.
