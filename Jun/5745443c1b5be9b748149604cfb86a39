A Lagos State University (LASU) Biochemistry graduate, Bunmi Savage, has come up with solutions to tackle mosquitoes and insects, DANIEL ESSIET reports. Lagos State University (LASU) Biochemistry graduate Bunmi Savage had thought she would work as a scientist. She searched for a job to no end.  Then she realised that rather than waste her time and energy looking for a job, she could deploy her knowledge of science to tackle the menace of mosquitoes and insects.This led to the establishment of Savage Purity Products, which manufactures  repellants and cleaners, among  others. She started the business with N2, 500 in 2014. Now she has two employees. She is happy that her dream of self-employment has come true. She explained that her training   gives her an edge in the business. But being an entrepreneur has its share of challenges, she said. There’s a payroll. Yet she is undaunted with the support from her family and the motivation to succeed. Despite the competition in the market, Bunmi is focused. For her, there is large market for household cleaning detergents. In addition, there is high demand for personal care products.These trends indicate that the future looks bright as more women entrepreneurs go into the renewable energy sector.
