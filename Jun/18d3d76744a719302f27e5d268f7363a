POPULAR Yoruba actor Ojo Arowosafe, who is better known Fadeyi Oloro, has revealed that he plans to go back to school after fully recovering from his ailment. Presently recuperating after an illness, the actor, in a chat with The Nation, said he dropped out at Primary Three but noted that he can easily pick out people’s mistakes when speaking to him in English. “People do not know that I dropped out at P rimary Three,” he said. “But I have been able to brush up myself and for this, I can easily pick out mistakes when people are communicating with me. “I have a lot to do in the industry and I am not yet there. This is why I intend to go back to school and have my certificate in a course that will be beneficial to me when I fully come back. “And when I am back, I will be producing my own movies. And with this I can easily promote my work myself in a way that is different from what I have been doing in the past. I still have a long way to go in this industry; I am yet to give my best.” The actor became popular in Jimoh Aliu’s production, ‘Yanpon Yanrin.’
