THE cut-off marks for the 2019/2020 admission will tomorrow be fixed by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board at a policy meeting with stakeholders at Gbongan, Osun State. Dropping the hint in a statement yesterday in Abuja, JAMB’s Head of Information Dr. Fabian Benjamin said the official cut-off marks would announced at the end of the policy meeting. He advised candidates to disregard any cut-off mark being peddled by fraudsters, describing it as “fake.” Benjamin said: “The clarification became necessary following speculations that the board had fixed the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) cut-off marks. “It is pertinent to note that the heads of institutions and other stakeholders will do so at a policy meeting which is chaired by the Honourable Minister of Education. The board has scheduled the 2019 policy meeting for June 11 at Gbongan, Osun State.” The board added that candidates should not also believe some rumour that a candidate could have two different results released by the server. Benjamin also advised candidates to print their admission letter. The board also said that it has successfully secured conviction for fifteen persons who were involved in double registration, examination malpractice and other infractions during the conduct of the UTME. The board said some of the convictions were secured in Zamfara, Kebbi and other states.
