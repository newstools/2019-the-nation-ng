Stakeholders in the building industry during the week engaged in a robust roundtable discussion to seek lasting solution to penetration of water, acids, oil, grease and chemicals on floors and walls. The event was the premiere launch of Danish Concrete Hardener, held at Radisson Blu Hotel, Ikeja GRA, Lagos. In a chart with newsmen, the Executive Director of the company Mr Jeep Veenhouwer, said: “Danish Concrete Hardener is a non-toxic liquid for treating concrete. There is no product odour, allergy, harm to the environment. “It is a water-based liquid, as such, absorbs quickly, deep into freshly poured concrete, provides rapid strength to concrete on setting and hardening. In 8 days after casting, shuttering can be removed, and floor can be used, compared to 28 days normally. It hardens concrete without forming a film on the surface and provides permanent dust-free floor surfaces.” The representative of the company Nigeria, Mr Henry Olofin who is also the MD/CEO of MEIBACH Nigeria Limited, said: “The construction management roundtable  and showcase  of Danish Concrete Hardener  provides a robust platform  to discuss the key challenges  facing  the industry and the evident yawning gap in construction innovation and building technology. ”The expansion of this innovative management roundtable  into the Nigerian environment  and roles of the government at all levels  vis a vis  industry players and the consumers in repositioning sector is timely as Nigeria’s massive backlog in affordable housing delivery is primed to witness continued demand for durable quality materials.“
