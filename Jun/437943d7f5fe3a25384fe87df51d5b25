Former Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung has admonished Nigerian youths to be involved in the promotion of the country’s culture in respect of dialects. Dalung spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital when he paid homage to the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi in his palace. He noted that there was no country in the world that had advanced without the development and promotion of its culture. Dalung, who was in Akure for the sixth National Council of Youth Development and the inauguration of the revised National Youth Policy 2019-2023 before the implementation said the issues affecting youth development in the country were becoming critical and had to be declared as emergencies at the national level. His words: “Youths are crying for attention more than ever before. They are crying for space, looking for guidance, better inspiration and they want to be prepared for the future. “We have been shaving heads of the youth in their absence. The white man started it, it must not continue. There is nowhere in the world that civilisation developed without their culture. “We must revert to our traditions. For us to succeed there is need to go back to our root for a better Nigeria.” The minister, however, appealed to all stakeholders, including traditional rulers and communities to put the issues affecting the youth in the front burner. According to him, this was to avoid the ‘Tsunami’ such neglect could cause in the future. Dalung said: “We are in Akure to present the reviewed National Youth Policy carefully put together by the Federal Government and its partners. “It treats issues such as the information technology, terrorism, cybercrime, employment that are crucial to youth development. “It is important to put it before Nigerians for implementation. Experts from different parts of the country will be participating”. Oba Aladelusi lauded the Federal Government for advocating the promotion of culture and on how to improve the Nigerian youth.
