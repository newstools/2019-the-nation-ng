Lagos State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has assured the government of its members’ compliance with  traffic laws. Its chairman, Alhaji Tajudeen Agbede, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday what members would ensure that the law works. He, however, pleaded with the government to carry the union along while making traffic laws. He also implored members to ensure that their drivers’ licences and vehicle particulars were in order. Agbede urged members to put waste baskets in their vehicles and refrain from driving against traffic. He enjoined passengers to use the bins provided in the vehicles instead of throwing refuse away through the windows. “Commuters intending to board commercial motorcycles (a.k.a. Okada) must always demand crash helmets before boarding. They must also restrain the riders from carrying more than one passenger during a trip. “Always caution drivers driving against traffic and the `Okada’ riders driving on the highways for your life is so dear to us,” the NURTW boss said.
