A Gudu Grade I Area Court in Abuja has ordered a divorce seeking housewife, Amina Abdulsalam to pay her estranged husband Sani Abdulraman, N20,000 as a condition for divorce. The petitioner, who filed a case against Abdulrahman, told the court that she could no longer tolerate her husband of 13 years and wished to divorce him. The Judge, Ado Muktar, said that as stipulated by Islamic law, when the divorce is at the insistence of the one of the couple, which in this case is the wife,  the court has a duty to grant them what they ask for. “I hereby, pronounce the dissolution of the marriage between Sani and Amina as stipulated by the Islamic law. “However, your husband cannot take you back until after a new marriage has taken place between you and someone else” he said. NAN reports that the petitioner told the court that her husband ran away with her children when she separated from him.
She also informed the court that the respondent restricted her from seeing them when he took them back to school. The respondent told the court that he would not contest her request for divorce. He told the court he was not interested in the money but requested that the court should order her to return the household items she took from his home when she left. The couple who got married in 2016 have two children. (NAN)
