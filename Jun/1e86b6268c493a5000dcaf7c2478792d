Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer has labelled Rafael Benitez’s departure from the club a “shambles”. It was announced on Monday that Benitez will leave St James’ Park following a failure to reach an agreement with owner Mike Ashley over a new contract, with the Spaniard’s existing deal set to end on June 30. Premier League record goal scorer Shearer expressed his disappointment that Benitez, who guided the Magpies to two mid-table finishes in the Premier League after winning promotion from the Sky Bet Championship in 2017, was allowed to walk away from the club. “A world-class manager. A manager who performed so well in very difficult circumstances. A manager who understood the fans,” Shearer wrote on Twitter. “Thanks and good luck rafabenitezweb, you were brilliant for the Toon. £SHAMBLES.” For the thousands of long-suffering fans, Benitez’s departure came as no real shock and Ashley, who has so far failed to sell the club despite there being interest, bore the brunt of the blame “It’s no surprise the depths Mike Ashley sinks to,” Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine The Mag, told Press Association Sport. “Any club who has a manager doing a good job, you make sure you tie him up on a new deal and give him what he wants long before it reaches this point. “Obviously, as part of the wider picture at Newcastle, it is a club that is only going to go in one direction while Mike Ashley stays. “Anyone who wants to try to use the takeover as a reason for not being able to convince Rafa Benitez to stay, it is a big fat red herring. “Even if there had been no talk of a takeover, it wouldn’t have made a difference. “No one who is credible will agree to work under Mike Ashley now.” Ex-Magpies midfielder Lee Clark and former forward Mick Quinn were among others to voice their displeasure at the decision. “There will be a huge backlash from the support. There will be a lot of anger. I see a difficult summer ahead,” Clark told Sky Sports News.
