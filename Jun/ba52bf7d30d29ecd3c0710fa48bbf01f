80 year old widow, Mrs Juliana Onuorah, has declared that losing oneâ€™s husband is the most painful and agonizing thing to happen to a woman. However, she said when such happens, the best option would be to trust in God and allow Him to come into your life. Onuorah, who spoke at Nkpor, Idemili North local government area of Anambra State, while celebrating her birthday, said the only thing bothering her was the death of her husband, Chief Francis Onuorah some years back. She said she had suffered intimidation and harassment from people who could not utter a word to her when the husband was alive, including groups and associations she gave help. Despite having only one daughter, Madam Onuorah, had trained more than three thousand people who call her mama. Most of them are today lawyers, pharmacists, doctors, engineers among other disciplines, but majority of them have deserted the woman. Also speaking, her only daughter, Patsy Onuorah, said her mother being alive to witness her 80th birthday, was the handiwork of God, despite the distractions.
