The Emir of Katsina, Alhaji AbdulMumini kabir Usman has called on Federal and State governments including the private sector to review the welfare package of journalists and other media workers in view of the essential nature of their job. The Emir who made the plea when he received members of the Katsina State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, who paid him Sallah homage at his palace in Katsina, observed that journalists are the most important public servants who deal with information which is a delicate item. He noted that by virtue of their watch-dog role, journalists hold the key to the wellbeing, peace, security and prosperity of any nation in the world. He, however, observed that journalists still earn salaries and allowances equivalent or lower than most other public servants both at state and federal levels, as well as the private sector, which is contrary to what obtains in developed countries of the world. He said ’’I have personally appealed to President Buhari to look into the welfare of Nigerian journalists because they are also hardworking and patriotic’’.
The emir also urged journalists to adhere to the ethics of journalism which he described as a noble profession. Responding, the Chairman of Katsina State Council of NUJ, Alhaji Buhari Mamman Daura, advocated the implementation of Media Salary Structure for Nigerian journalists across board. He urged the media and the civil society to continue to advocate enhanced welfare package for journalists until the objective is actualized.
