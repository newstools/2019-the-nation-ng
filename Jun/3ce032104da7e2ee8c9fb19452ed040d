The Zamfara Chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to provide credible opposition to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. The state’s chairman of the party, Alhaji Lawal Liman disclosed this while speaking with newsmen in Gusau on Thursday, saying that his party members would continue to be law abiding citizens. “We believe that the victory of PDP in the state is God’s decision and we accept it in good faith, our concern is how the state could move forward,” he said. He expressed sadness that some unknown persons were destroying APC billboards across the state. He, therefore called on the State Government and the PDP leadership to sensitise their supporters against unrully behaviours.
