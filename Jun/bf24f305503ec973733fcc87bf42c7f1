The Speaker House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Saturday, sought the support and cooperation of Nigerians on the need to move the country forward.  He said there was much work to be done. The Speaker gave the remarks at the palace of the Oba of Lagos, Oba Rilwan Akiola, during a courtesy visit, adding that he was in Lagos to thank the people for supporting him during the legislative years as a member of the House of Representatives. He explained that being the Speaker of the House would entail four years of hard work, commitment to the rule of law and dedication to solving the challenges of insecurity in the country. Gbajabiamila said the combination of his experience and that of the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, as lawmakers would serve as advantage in solving the problems facing the country. The Speaker said he would work with members of the House of Assembly to ensure that Lagos State property confiscated by the Federal Government is returned. He stressed that the House would equally ensure that other parts of the country facing similar challenges would be addressed. In his welcome remarks, Akiolu said the House and the country did not make a wrong choice in electing Gbajabiamila the Speaker of the House. According to him, the Speaker had all that it takes to make the country proud, noting that his leadership would work in the interest of the people. He urged Gbajabiamila to prevail on the Federal Government to release Lagos property excised by military fiat. He said: “When people started saying that the House will become a rubber stamp under Gbajabiamila, I said they did not understand. I know that God has given the House a brilliant Speaker, full of intelligence and wisdom. “I know the security challenges will take ample place in the House discussion. Again, not all the Fulani Herdsmen are bad, only a few of them who have been atrocious in their livelihood are hell bend in fomenting trouble in the country.”
