The Lagos State branch of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) alumni association is hoping to raise N708 million to help students through its Support Our University Project (SOUP). Speaking on the project at the Alumni secretariat in UNILAG on Tuesday, Chairman of the association, Dr Lukumon Adeoti, said through SOUP, the association plans to offer scholarships, organize competitions seminars, and employability and skill acquisition training. “Rather than people hiding their money, they should come and invest in this good project. The SOUP is a long term project.  We are seeking money from the town to develop the University of Lagos. We cannot leave everything for the government; we want to support the VC in the development of the university,” he said. Already, Adeoti said the association had started helping students though the project. “We distributed N150,000 to 20 indigent students amounting to N3 million; gave a special computer worth N135,000 to a visually-impaired student; assisted a Russian language student with N100,000; donated N100,000 to the International School, University of Lagos and purchased land at N6 million,” he said. Adeoti also spoke of  the association’s upcoming lecture in honour of the late Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Adetokunbo Sofoluwe Memorial Lecture scheduled to hold July 4. “The lecture is to sustain his legacy. Prof. Sofoluwe was a nice man who assisted everyone, everyone benefited from him”. The lecture, which is the seventh in the series, will be delivered by the Vice Chancellor, Ondo state University of medical sciences, Prof. Friday Okonofua. Okonofua would speak on “Changing the Archetypal Medical Education System for Transformational health care.”
