The three tiers of government have been tasked to tackle corruption in all sectors so that Nigeria can make progress. Speaking at a Business Network Breakfast organised by Kings College Old Boys Association (KCOBA), and held at the school premises in Lagos, the president, Kings College Old Boys Association, Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim Imam, made this known on Saturday while addressing members of the association. According to Imam, corruption is a major disease plaguing the country and affecting all the sectors. His words: “No country can be this corrupt and expect to develop at the same time. For instance, the speaker just revealed to us that the cost of producing one thousand megawatt of electricity in China is about 250-400 thousand USD, while in Nigeria, it is about tenfold; about two million USD to produce just one megawatt because of corruption.” Speaking about the essence of the network breakfast, Imam said KCOBA organises it regularly whereby it takes on very topical issue that borders on a critical sector of the economy. “We analyse it, invite a prominent old boy of the school to come and talk to us about that sector. Today, we are talking about power; we ask questions so that at the end of the day we are better informed,” he said. On his part, the guest speaker at the event, CEO Lavayo Energy Advisors, Mr Lolu Adubifa, who spoke on the topic “Nigeria Power Sector: Opportunities and Threats”, pointed out that constant power supply is the hallmark of a developed economy. “Any nation whose energy need is epileptic in supply, prolongs her development and risks losing potential investors,” he quipped.
