Leadway Assurance Company Limited has recorded an increase in claims payment from N27.4 billion in 2017 financial year end to N33.8 billion in 2018. The company also recorded a 15 per cent growth in its assets base with N312.7 billion recorded in 2018 as against N271.9 billion in 2017 in addition to a four per cent increase in Gross Written Premium (GWP) from N84.1 billion in 2017 to N87.5 billion in 2018. Speaking during the company’s 47th Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in Lagos, the Managing Director, Mr. Oye Hassan Odukale, stated that Leadway has continued to lead other industry players in the area of claims payment. He restated the company’s commitment to prompt claims payment as the cornerstone of its business principle, revealing that the company has paid claims in excess of N110 billion over the last five years. He said: “The value we have created over the years is embedded in the loyalty and commitment of the greatest number to keep Leadway as a legacy for several generations. We are grateful to our treasured customers, brokers, agents and other stakeholders who have objectively trusted in the liquidity advantage and unmatched conservative risk reserves we hold as a yardstick for placing certain risks with us. We are equally grateful to them for the testimonial campaign which attests to us as the insurer to beat in claims payment.” On the future outlook of the company, the Chairman, General Martin Luther Agwai (CFR), said the company’s operation in 2019 and beyond would be driven by the strategy of using digitisation and creativity to harness unexploited and prompt means of selling insurance as a contingency benefit to its target market while also strategically deepening the penetration of insurance to smallholder farmers in every community through the instrumentality of Area Yield Index Crop insurance and creating insurance awareness in the rural communities.
