Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has said the government will not permit the proliferation of vigilance groups. According to him, youths interested in helping to build the state’s security architecture should join the State Neighbourhood Safety Corps Agency. Wike spoke yesterday when traditional rulers from Ahoada East and West Local Government Areas visited him in the Government House. The monarchs used the opportunity to submit arms retrieved from repentant criminals in their areas after a local amnesty programme. The governor said the decision became necessary after OSPAC from Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area started over stepping its boundaries. He said: “I am being careful about vigilance groups because of what OSPAC is doing; it is now going beyond its boundaries. We will reintegrate OSPAC into the State Neighbourhood Safety Corps Agency, and anyone who wants to support the security structure should join the State Neighbourhood Safety Corps Agency. We will not approve local vigilance for different councils. “We granted amnesty in the past, and some boys went back to crime. For now, we are doing what is called ‘Binding Over’. If they renege, the law will take its course. When the court binds you over, it will be difficult for you to renege.” The governor also praised the monarch of Ekpeye land and Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly, Ehie Edison, for taking proactive actions to improve security. According to him, the government will reward the Divisional Police Officers of Ahoada East and West, and the Joint Task Force Commander in the area, Maj. Nwachukwu, for their roles in promoting peace and security. The Eze Igbu Upkata, Dr. Felix Otuwarikpo, said Traditional Rulers from Ahoada East and West Local Government Areas worked with the security agencies to ensure that peace returned to Ekpeye land. Otuwarikpo urged the government to take steps to ensure that the boys don’t return to crime.
