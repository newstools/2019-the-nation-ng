Nigerian Army wrestler, Okeke Tochukwu has set his sigh on securing qualification tickets to this year’s Africa Games in Morocco and the World Wrestling Championships in Kazakhstan in September at the forthcoming forth-coming 3rd Governor Dickson National Classics in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The showpiece tournament, which will be staged from 23rd to 30th June, 2019 at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Samson Siasia Sports Stadium in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, will also serve as qualifiers for this year’s Africa Games in Morocco and the World Wrestling Championships in Kazakhstan in September. Tochukwu informed NationSport that he hopes to represent his fatherland at the African Games in Morocco after missing out of the last edition held in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo, despite picking a qualification ticket. “I’m training with the Nigerian Army team at the in Zaria right now. Our preparation is intact and our training is going smoothly and the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai has given us his full backing. Now, everyone in high spirit for the championship. We all want to do the Army proud because they have really taken care of us. Though it was very painful for me at that time because I know I could have added to the country’s medal haul. Right now, I want to experience the African Games and hopefully come home with a gold medal,” the national Greco-Roman Champion told NationSport. No fewer than 500 athletes and officials from different state s and wrestling clubs around the country are expected in Yenagoa for the Classics.
