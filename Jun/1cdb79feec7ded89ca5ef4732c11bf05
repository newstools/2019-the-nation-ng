The Alliance for Democracy, AD, candidate in the last gubernatorial election in Lagos State, Mr. Owolabi Salis, and other aggrieved contestants during the polls have been enjoined to join hands with the new governor of the state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to facilitate good governance for Lagosians. Making the appeal in a statement issued in Lagos, the national co-ordinator, Pastors for Integrity Initiative, Bishop Kayode Williams, urged the former candidates to accept their defeat in good faith. “Babajide Sanwo-Olu has emerged the winner and has been sworn into office as the governor; my appeal and that of other members of my group is that aggrieved contestants should embrace Sanwo-Olu. Moreover, the Elections Petitions Tribunal sitting in Lagos State has also dismissed the petition filed by Salis against Sanwo-Olu’s election, therefore Salis and others should sheathe their swords and bury the hatchet, instead of creating distractions for the new administration in Lagos State either through litigations and other forms of protests,” declared Williams. Advising Sanwo-Olu to hit the ground running, the cleric said the governor should ensure that he assemble a team that will help him realize his wish of taking Lagos State to the next level. “We pray for Governor Sanwo-Olu’s success. We also pray that Lagos State will continue to remain Centre of Excellence under his stewardship. He should, however, ensure that he assemble a winning team that will be able to deliver,” he added.
