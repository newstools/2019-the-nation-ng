The Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) said it has created a new generation of  exporters through practical and theoretical training of business executives, bankers, civil servants, unemployed graduates and even retired citizens with interest in export business. Its Executive Director/CEO, Olusegun Awolowo, who spoke in Abuja during the passing out of 62 trainees of zero to export capacity building programme, assured that it will continue to create opportunities to imbibe the culture of exportation through capacity building and training programmes. Represented by  Director Product Development, William Ezeagu, Awolowo said the zero-to-export programme is part of the Council’s efforts to reposition the non-oil sector through job creation and inclusive growth, thereby making it a major contributor to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He added that the programme is anchored on a Public Private Partnership (PPP), stressing that  so far, the programme has trained and graduated over 200 trainees from the Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja centres. He said: “Most of the trainees have formed registered cooperatives, and are already exporting. Apart from job creation, it is hoped that the programme would obviously bring about a high value addition to non-oil products and services in the country at a time when the nation needs to revive its manufacturing, agricultural and industrial sectors.”
