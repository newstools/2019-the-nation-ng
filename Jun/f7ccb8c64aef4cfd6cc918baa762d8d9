The Adamawa State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board has announced a reduction of N51, 000 from the initial Hajj fare of N1.510 million for the 2019 holy pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. The initially fare approved for the state’s intended pilgrims was N1.510 million. Mr Umar Bobboyi, Permanent Secretary and Executive Secretary of the Board made the announcement on Saturday in Yola . ” The Adamawa State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board after a maiden meeting with the 2019 Hajj Technical Committee held on Saturday in Yola reduced N51,000 from this year’s Hajj fare,” Bobboyi said. He said that the intending pilgrims from the state would now pay the sum of N1.459 million only which is the least in the country. He said the board had arranged for immediate refund of the difference to some of the intending pilgrims who had already completed payment of the earlier announced fares. According to the executive secretary the board has also extended the deadline for the registration of intending pilgrims for the 2019 Hajj to July 10. He explained that the downward review of the fares was occasioned by the reclassification of land transportation routes to be used by Nigerian pilgrims in the holy land, and the reduction of their charges by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah.
