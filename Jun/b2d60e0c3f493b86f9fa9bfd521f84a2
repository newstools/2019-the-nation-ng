A don of the Rivers State University (RSU) formerly Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RSUST) Port Harcourt, Prof. Emmanuel Amadi, has been murdered in his residence at Rumuorlumeni, Port Harcourt. Amadi of the Department of Microbiology, until he was gruesomely murdered in the early hours of Tuesday, was living with his family members in a personal house close to Rivers state government-owned Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, Rumuorlumeni, Port Harcourt. The area is notorious for criminal activities, especially incessant kidnapping, cultism, armed robbery and assassination. A source, who was close to the family of the slain lecturer, described the murder as very barbaric and so pathetic, considering Amadi’s enormous contributions to human capital development, research, teaching and community service. The source called on security agencies to apprehend and prosecute the killers of the don, in order to serve as a deterrent to other criminals. Spokesman of RSU, Mr. Sydney Enyindah, while reacting through the telephone on Tuesday night, said: “Prof. Amadi was attacked in his house at Rumuorlumeni, Port Harcourt in the early hours of today by armed robbers. “The sad information came while we were having management meeting. The situation will become clearer tomorrow.” Rivers Police spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), also confirmed the incident. Omoni said: “I spoke with the Vice-Chancellor of RSU, Port Harcourt, Prof. Blessing Didia, five minutes before you called me. “The VC of RSU told me through the telephone that he heard of the attack on Prof. Amadi from the grapevine, without official communication from the family to the university’s authorities.”
