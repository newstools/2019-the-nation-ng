The Socialist Party of Nigeria (SPN) has lamented the parlous state of the economy and how the hopes and aspirations of the masses have remained in vain, 20 years after the return of civil rule. In a statement by its Acting National Chairman, Abiodun Bamigboye, and National Secretary, Chinedu Bosah, said June 12 marks in the annals of Nigeria a confirmation of the bravery, resoluteness and courage of the working class, youth and poor Nigerians to struggle against an oppressive and unjust order. But the SPN said nothing has changed, because “the same kind of military jackboot authoritarianism, repressive policies and attacks on democratic rights which were the hallmark of military rule have regularly been a feature of civil rule since 1999” are still in place today.
