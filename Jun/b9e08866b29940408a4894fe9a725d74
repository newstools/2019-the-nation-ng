Youth restiveness in the oil-rich Niger Delta is, arguably, as old as when crude oil was discovered in Oloibiri in present-day Bayelsa State. Till date, pockets of it still resurface from time to time. Discontents and grievances resulting from unmet expectations coupled with ecological and environmental damage done to oil-bearing communities by multinational oil companies have contributed to the heightening tension and frictions among host communities and the OICs. When these grey problems are not expeditiously addressed, irate youths have had to resort to brute force to subdue OICs to address some of their grievances. These usually manifest in the forms of kidnapping, pipeline vandalism, destruction of oil facilities and general atmosphere of insecurity. Such manifestations of restiveness and mutual suspicion also exist in oil-producing communities of Ibeno, Eket, Esit Eket and Onna in Akwa Ibom State where ExxonMobil prospects for crude oil offshore. Youths, women and other stakeholders in these communities have also engaged in some forms of disagreement with the oil giant over certain issues such as oil spillage, environmental pollution; lack of job opportunities for their youths and contracts for those indigenous to the host communities. In its bid to genuinely address the plethora of demands, grievances and complaints from these communities, ExxonMobil have devised means to carry them along through its corporate social responsibility (CRS) programmes. In line with its CSR policy, ExxonMobil recently attempted to change the narrative by initiating the social investment programme which is community-based and driven by the youth in the four neighbouring communities of Ibeno, Eket, Es ExxonMobil operator of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) joint venture, through its subsidiary, Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN), is pursuing peace and harmony with its neighbouring communities through what it called Community Investment Programme (CIP). The CIP has five pseudo-components of Community Safety Awareness Campaign, Clean and Green Environment, Peace and Conflict Resolution, Market Beautification and a Beach Party. Speaking at the launch of the CIP recently  in Eket, the General Manager, Public and Government Affairs, Nigel Cokey-Gam said the programme is intended to foster mutual peace, enhance the welfare of people of the community as well as strengthen the cordial relationship between MPN and its neighbouring communities. According to Nigel, CIP was just one of the three joint venture contributions to the development of its neighbouring communities and the empowerment of the people. His words: “Total investment by the JV in this round of community programmes in Akwa Ibom State is N170 million and is one of JV’s several initiatives dedicated to positively engage our youths, re-orientate and re-inculcate virtues other than the adoption of confrontation as the only mode of engagement.” He added: “The JV is here for the long haul and is repositioning to deliver greater value to the communities, Akwa Ibom State, and Nigeria.” On his part, the General Manager, Joint Venture Operations, Tom Benjaminsen sued for peace as a basic tonic required for MPN to sustained contribution and value additions. Declaring the programme open, the Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel , who was represented by the Commissioner for Transport and Petroleum Resources, Mr. Orman Esin commended Mobil Producing Nigeria for the initiative. He acknowledged the company’s contributions to the development of the state, even as he called for sustainability of the programme. The community investment programme is not just community-driven; it is facilitated by indigenous non-governmental organisation and sponsored by Mobil Producing Nigeria. No doubt, ExxonMobil has given 100 per cent of the programme to the local content. Each community leadership is the one ensuring that the project is done. For instance, resource persons are from the community and those who coordinate the NGOs are from the community. This informs the tremendous success which the programme has recorded. The Coordinator, Mrs. Emem Nkereuwem of Arts and Skills Development Initiative, the NGO facilitating the components that comprises road safety awareness campaigns and clean green environment project, observed that it was instructive for Mobil to lead the trail on safety, clean and green environment which has been the tradition within their enclave, and still takes up the inculcation of this tradition within their neighbouring communities. It shows, she said, a new approach towards community relations. This, to a large extent, will make the people embrace the company’s attitude of safety and clean environment. A lot is happening with our climate, and this has led to the unpredictability of weather conditions in recent years. As ExxonMobil leads the communities on green environment, the company has shown its willingness to work with the communities for a greener environment. Environmental neglect poses an unreasonable risk to the physical health and safety of humankind. As the campaign is sustained, malaria, which is one of the highest causes of death in the communities, will be eliminated. This will gradually take us to the earth which God saw and called “good”. According to Nkereuwem an estimated 202 million malaria cases happen in Nigeria out which 440,000 deaths are recorded annually. He added that the figure could be higher. It is therefore imperative that we make our environment clean and green for a free and harmonious habitation. While on the streets on community safety, she advocated for the promulgation of law against alcohol and other negative substances at car parks. The resource person for safety awareness campaign component, Mr. Godwin William who is President-General of Afigh Iwaad I Ekid, a socio-cultural group for the Eket people, compartmentalised his lecture into home safety, personal safety, safe driving and ending with tips for night driving. The engagement of these two components was deep, interactive and enlightening as youths from the four neighbouring communities of Ibeno, Eket, Esit Eket and Onna were present to listen, clean and move in a carnival motorcade to engage the people. “This is the first time Mobil Producing Nigeria is coming down to the ordinary people, and it is very encouraging. It is a new beginning for the company and the people for a better relationship that will entrench peace and a win-win bargain for all stakeholders,” Mr. Samuel Akpan the Chairman of Ibeno Youth Council said. Youth President in Eket, Mr. Charles Edohoeket said the various components of the community investment programme have not only integrated the company as a worthy ally in development but has also succeeded in integrating us as members of this community. “We now know one another’s capability in organising events. Some of us have been recognised because our capability has been showcased. And we are grateful to Mobil for its contributions to the growth of our communities,” he said.         At the presentation of market items under the market beautification/provision components, the facilitating consultant on market beautification and beach party, Mr. Joseph Utin, said a total of 500 tables, 500 chairs and 500 tarpaulins have been presented to traders in selected markets in the four local government areas. The market items are to support the trade of the beneficiaries and empower them in some ways to keep their trade going. “It is not safe and healthy to have that old woman selling garri in Udua Nka stand on her feet all day long. It is not safe and healthy to let the woman selling fish in Mkpanak Market to be under the sun all day. “As a responsible corporate entity that feels the pains of its communities, MPN’s donation of market tables, chairs and tarpaulins will go a long way in solving problems faced by entrepreneurs,” he said. Features of the beach party included variety of games, indigenous cultural displays by the local aficionados, tug of war among management and representatives of the neighbouring communities. Music stars such as Harrysong and Okon Lagos were present. Communities at the beach party will never forget the fun, laughter, dance, cultural displays and the close contacts with stars they usually see on television. Asuquo Bassey, an old man that found his way to the beach from Onna said though he couldn’t participate in many of the activities, seeing people laugh and enjoy themselves has given him reasons to live long. Under the corporate social responsibility pyramid, ExxonMobil, through Community Investment Programme has demonstrated that it is a good corporate citizen. Their philanthropic responsibility was outstanding as resources were channeled directly to the communities to improve the quality of life of the people. Youth leaders in Onna Samuel Umoafia and Etiene Bob said: “This is a new dawn for Mobil in Akwa Ibom State. It is an unexpected development, a clear departure from what used to be. No community in the state is against them. We are civilised people and wish to engage under justice and fairness. We thank them for this and plead it becomes a yearly event”.
