Driving without motor insurance policy is an offence, the regulatory body of insurance, the Insurers Committee has said. The Committee, which comprises the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) and insurance operators, said it is a must for vehicle owners and others to have a motor insurance policy. Its Sub-Committee on Publicity and Communication Chairman Mr Oye Hassan-Odukale said the committee is educating the public on the need for insurance and its benefits. He pointed out that motor insurance protects road users from the unexpected. According to him, having motor insurance goes beyond being free from road safety officials. He explained that there are two  motor insurance, Third Party Motor Insurance and Comprehensive Motor Insurance. He called on every Nigerian, who  drives, to buy motor insurance policy, noting that the premium for a Third Party is N5000 He said: “It protects road users from unexpected occurrences on the highway. Insurance covers when someone bashes your car or breaks into your car, as well as cases of accidental damage to third party property while driving. “As the name implies, Third Party Motor Insurance covers for accidental damage, injury to third party property, which refers to other road users while driving. It does not cover accidental damage to the insured vehicle. Comprehensive motor insurance, on the other hand, covers for loss or damage to the vehicle caused by fire or theft, damage to third party as well as personal injury or fatality resulting from accident. It also comes with perks, such as covering the cost of towing your vehicle, as well as a car tracker. “It is worthy of note that insurance companies, under the umbrella of Insurers Committee and National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), have made insurance policies affordable to all Nigerians. With N5,000, you can get your third party motor insurance.
