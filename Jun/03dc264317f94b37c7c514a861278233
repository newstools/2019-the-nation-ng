THE Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has warned corps members against presenting fake documents during registration in camps. He said corps members caught presenting fake documents would be handed over to law enforcement agents for prosecution. Ibrahim gave the warning while monitoring the registration of prospective corps members deployed to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Nasarawa State for this year’s Batch “B” Stream I service year. A statement by NYSC’s Director of Press and Public Relations, Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, said the DG warned that the management of the scheme had measures in place to clamp down on perpetrators and prosecute them. Ibrahim advised corps members to be security conscious and embrace the skills acquisition programme of the scheme to become self-empowered and wealth creators. The NYSC chief admonished them to obey the scheme’s bye-laws and be of good conduct during and after their orientation course. He enjoined them to be patriotic to the ideals of NYSC scheme. “The DG, during the visits, monitored the distribution of kits to corps members and inspected corps members’ hostels, camp clinics, kitchen, sporting facilities, among others,” the statement said.
