The Chief Executive Officer, Women in Africa (WIA), Mrs. Hafsat Abiola-Costello, has said lack of access to credit is not the only hurdle hindering women empowerment, but  also their inability to know what to do and how to do it. Mrs Abiola-Castello, who spoke in Lagos ahead of the 54th Project of the WIA Summit holding this weekend in Marrakesh, Morocco,  emphasised that there was an urgent need to empower many African women to engage the world and create a new paradigm shift in entrepreneurial world. According to her, women represent half of the continent’s population and produce 62 per cent of its economic goods. While 27 per cent of women in Africa create a business, which is the highest rate globally, 34 per cent are high performers when they hold executive positions, adding that only 8.5 per cent  are salaried. “WIA is set to change the perception and ensure another African story is told, a story celebrating women’s will, talent, potential, actions and commitment to create new businesses and to forge economic, political and cultural alliances with the rest of the world. Our objective is to address these issues during the summit and demonstrate how Africa can benefit from a new and optimistic story-telling to, at last, take over the rightful leadership of its economic future,” she explained. The WIA boss said the summit would provide a year’s mentorship plan for entrepreneurs in Africa. She added that the event was introduced to help the 54 countries meet future challenges, which is connected to its growing population. According to her, the United Nations (UN) projected that countries’population would increase by 2021 and that most of these people were entrepreneurs. “If we train them and change the perception, it will affect the economy positively, especially when the population further increases,” Mrs Abiola-Castello said.
