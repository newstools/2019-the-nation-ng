A former Personal Assistant to the late Bashorun Moshood Abiola, Chief Olu Akerele, has hailed the renaming of the National Stadium after the winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election. Akerele, who said the renaming by President Muhammadu Buhari would make the late politician happy in his grave, added that no other head of state had honoured the late billionaire like the President. He said Abiola was a lover of sports, adding that the national stadium remained the best sporting monument to bear the late politician’s name. Akerele, in a statement in Abuja yesterday, urged the citizens to support Buhari in his second term, According to him, the President would not let the electorate down. He said it would be wrong for the late Pillar of Sports in Africa to die without a sporting centre named after him despite his contributions to the growth of sports in Nigeria and Africa. He said: “Naming the National Stadium after MKO Abiola is commendable. Apart from MKO’S legendary philanthropy, another area where he excelled was in the sporting arena, which earned him the title of Pillar of Sports in Africa. “President Buhari has truly proved himself as real ‘Daniel come to judgment’ by rewriting the historical roles played by MKO in almost all areas of national development, which some misguided former military officers tried to rubbish in the past 25 years! “I’m sure that Abiola is happy and will be smiling in his grave now. He has not laboured in vain and his death has also not been without notice. President Buhari remains a hero we should encourage so that he would do more. ”
