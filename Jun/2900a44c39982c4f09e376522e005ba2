Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has said that his administration will boost school enrolment and support good nutrition for the children. “We maintain that access to quality education and good nutrition are key to the future of our children,” the Chief Press Secretary to AbdulRazaq, Rafiu Ajakaye, quoted the governor as saying in a statement commemorating the Day of the African Child. The governor said: “It is for this reason that our administration is seriously considering joining the National School Feeding programme to boost good nutrition and school enrolment for our children. “Also, Kwara will henceforth pay better attention to the quality of education our children get.” About the rising number of school-age children roaming the street, the governor urged parents to avoid anything that could jeopardise the future of their children and the state. “The Child Rights Act is domesticated in Kwara and thus applies to every child. What this means, in part, is that it is unlawful for any parents not to enrol their children in school. On our part, we’ll do our utmost to boost economic activities to create wealth,” the statement stated.
