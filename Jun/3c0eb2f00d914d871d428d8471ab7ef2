A few days ago former APC National Chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, grabbed the headlines by savaging the leadership style of his successor, Adams Oshiomhole, as akin to that of an ‘agbero’ – street lingo for motor park tout. His intervention was in support of the mini-rebellion fronted by the party’s Deputy National Chairman, Lawal Shuaibu, calling for the ouster of Oshiomhole over the ruling party’s catastrophic losses in Zamfara State and elsewhere. I’m not too sure what the former chairman hoped to achieve with his verbal salvo and the manner in which he unleashed it. It certainly cannot be internal health and cohesion of the organisation he once headed. Oyegun believes the incumbent party chair lacks the capacity to lead the APC. His statement proudly declared that the ruling party’s most glorious days were under his stewardship. How generous! A lot of people would think otherwise. Under him the party snatched defeat from the jaws of victory when despite its majority in the National Assembly, a PDP-backed alliance seized power and relegated APC to a beggarly status. His leadership was so spineless that it could do nothing to those who had thumbed their noses at the party leadership. Under him, governors were bigger than the party and their word was law. He ruled at their pleasure and was ever willing to do their bidding. If his stewardship was so satisfactory, a consensus with the buy-in of Buhari and the same governors who had been propping him up, would not have forced him out. I understand that at that point he wasn’t quite ready to give up power, so his removal would have been a bitter pill to swallow. But he left office with grace and dignity. His bilious comments about Oshiomhole won’t return him to his former position; they only lower him in the estimation of many who used to hold him in higher regard.
