The Ogun State Deputy Governor , Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele,  has warned  residents of the state against indiscriminate dumping of refuse along river channels. Oyedele, who dropped the warning  shortly after she visited the flood affected areas, said the problems had prevailed over the  years as a result of failed structures and insufficient capacity to make needed repairs. The Deputy Governor added that future expansion of the canals  were not  put into consideration when most of the houses built around them years ago were constructed. She hinted that having identified the causes of these problem,  which are capital intensive, government would immediately  step into action by collaborating with the Federal Government for support to the state for implementation of  remedial works needed  for  construction to put an end to the ugly situation. Giving a background on Sokori River which passes through the whole of Abeokuta , the Permanent Secretary , Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Kayode Ademolake pointed out  that the river is a confluence  point to River Ogun that linked  many parts of the state and terminated at Itoku spanning 300km length with so many bridges crossing it. He added that all these adjourning bridges had constraint as they have under-size for the volume of water passing through them.
