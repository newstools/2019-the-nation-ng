It was tragic on Thursday in Abuja when a 17-year-old boy died in a flood around Lokogoma Estate. Findings revealed that the boy whose name is Tuesday Bala died as a result of the heavy downpour that lasted for over four hours. Few weeks ago, the Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Agency (FCT FEMA), rescued some residents of Emerald Flower estate, Lokogoma district and Maitama extension after flood-ravaged and submerged the communities. Deputy Director, Forecasting, Response and Mitigation of the FCT FEMA, Florence Wenegieme refuted claims that a 17- year- old boy got drowned and died in the flood. Wenegieme said nobody died in the flood, adding it was occasioned by obstruction caused by buildings erected on the waterways thereby hindering the free flow of water. She said the problem of flooding around the area started three years ago due to bad construction of bridges and roads by estate developers. Her word: “Officials of the FCT, FEMA were there and nobody died in the flood. What caused the flood was due to obstruction caused by buildings erected on the waterways and hindering the free flow of water. Bad construction of bridges and roads also caused the flood.” She advised developers to ensure that roads and bridges are well constructed, adding that residents should stop dumping refuse in flowing water so as to avert similar occurrence.
