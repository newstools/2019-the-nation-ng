A student of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State (FUTO), has drowned in a swimming pool. This comes barely three weeks after three students were found dead after taking tramadol. The victim, a Microbiology graduate, identified as Stephen Igwilo, who just graduated, went to swim in a hotel at Eziobodo. The schoolâ€™s spokesman, Mrs. Uche Bright-Nwaelue, said Igwilo was among the last students who graduated from the institution. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said he was yet to be officially briefed. He, however, promised to investigate.
