Usheoritse Itsekiri has qualified for IAAF World Athletics Championships holding in Doha, Qatar later in the year. Itsekiri ran a Personal Best (PB) time of 10.07s (+1.7) to win men’s 100m at the 55th International Whitsun Festival in Rehlingen, Germany. Itsekiri, who won the 100m gold medal at the 2018 National Sports Festival, is now Nigeria’s 3rd fastest in the 100m this year behind Divine Oduduru and Raymond Ekevwo. Itsekiri joins Tobilola Amusan, Blessing Okagbare, Oduduru and Ekevwo to represent Nigeria at the world championships. Also at the Whitsun meet, Seye Ogunlewe opened his season with a 100m PB of 10.11s to finish 3rd in the race behind Itsekiri and Brazil’s Pereira Rodrigo who came in 2nd, clocking an identical time as Ogunlewe while Alowonle Rilwan came 4th in the 400M hurdles event with 50.46s. Unfortunately Ogunlewe was just 0.01s short of the 10.10s World Championships qualifying mark.
