AFTER three years of planning, cross-over actress, Kehinde Bankole, has released her long term dream of owning a jewelry collection. The actress made it known that the photo shoot to promote the collection was done three year ago with her collaborator Gbenga Art Smith. “This was a shoot I did with my long-time collaborator @gbengaartsmith in 2016. Yes, you read right- a whole 3 years ago!!! Yet still looks as good as new. Now imagine the kind of magic we are creating now in 2019 with my jewelry collection,” she wrote. One of the collection named after popular singer Asa, had the actress say this: “Ayára bí Àsá! (“As swift as an eagle!”) Here is the “ASA” earring (named after acclaimed Nigerian-French singer @asaofficial). When I think of Asa and her meteoric rise to the zenith of music excellence like a swift eagle, I think of passion as fierce as red and a spirit as bold and beautiful as these tassel earrings…She is indeed the Queen of hearts. Our hearts.” Other collections are ‘MALALA’ named after Malala Yousafzai, the 21-year old Pakistani female activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. Another is ‘IBK’ which is named after the first female chairman of First Bank, Ibukun Awosika and ‘GENNY’ stud earrings, named after Nollywood diva, Genevieve Nnaji. According to Bankole, the stud earring describes Genevieve’s simplicity. “It is so her…simple and classy! I remember how she walked up to me after I won “Best actress” category at AMVCA 2015 and gave me a warm hug and congratulated me with few words coated in gold. A kind-hearted dynamo and a half is who you are, Queen Genny.”
