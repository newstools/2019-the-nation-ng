The Assistant Comptroller General of Customs (ACG) for Zone B, Bashir Abubakar, has taken over the mantle of leadership of the Zone ‘B’ as its Zonal Coordinator. The new Customs chief warned smugglers of contraband to steer clear of the zone. He said: “It is not going to be easy for smugglers and their accomplices under my watch.” Addressing the personnel of the zone when he assumed office Thursday, Abubakar told the officers and men that he would not tolerate any form of indiscipline from anyone. The ACG urged them to redouble their efforts at taking the service to an enviable height by allowing their training and experience to make the right impact. He advised them to desist from all forms of indiscipline and lukewarm attitude to work. The ACG appealed to the public to expose anybody found smuggling anything in the zone. “You must operate within the confines of the law to avoid bringing the service to disrepute. We must work together as a team to boost the revenue generation profile of commands in the zone,” he said. Abubakar promised to operate an open-door policy, saying he will not hesitate to discipline any erring officer. “I am a disciplinarian to the core, punctuality at work, on neatness. Strict adherence to laid-down rules must be your watch words. Any form of abscondment from duty without due approval will not be tolerated. “However, I have received good news about this zone and wish to urge you all to sustain the good works,” he said.
