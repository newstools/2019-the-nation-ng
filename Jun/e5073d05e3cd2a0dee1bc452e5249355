GROUP protecting the interest of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election, Deservation and Pukka Initiative, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to treat with honesty the controversy surrounding its server, if it wishes to retain the trust Nigerians have in it. The Convener of the pro-Atiku group, Dr. Sani Adamu, who addressed reporters in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, said INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, lied when he said INEC did not have a server. “As a public institution, the commission was well prepared, procured and installed a server in all the 36 states of the country and Abuja,” Sani said. According to him, the PDP and Atiku Abubakar are smart enough to have received the required information about INEC and its affairs to take care of “effort by the cabal, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari, and now INEC, to deny the real winner of the 2019 presidential election”. He said it was a national disaster waiting to happen for the leadership of INEC to deny having a server and IC upgrade. Sani said the INEC chairman, in one of his briefings in preparation for this year’s elections, publicly declared that “we are pioneering and deploying in the 2019 general election a new platform for electronic collation and transmission of results of the election”. The spokesman said activities on the deployment of servers by INEC received the required approval and were implemented between the first quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2018 towards the elections in the first quarter this year. Sani added: “This denial by INEC will spell an end to the otherwise brilliant service records and accomplishment of the chairman’s personality and a disgrace to an important public and trusted institution.”
