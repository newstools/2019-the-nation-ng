President  Muhammadu Buhari is determined to provide platforms that will encourage more women participation in maritime to boost economic growth,  First Lady Aisha Buhari said on Tuesday in Lagos. She spoke at an event to mark the 2019 Day of the Seafarer. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) chose the theme: Onboard with Gender Equality, which resonates with its theme for this year’s World Maritime Day. Dr. Buhari stressed the need to promote gender balancing in the seafaring career. She said the president is aware of the economic benefits that come with encouraging women in the sector. Represented by the wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, Dr Buhari commended NIMASA’s efforts to encourage women in the maritime sector. She noted that it was in line with the president’s aspirations for the sector. Dr Buhari said: “Under the current leadership of NIMASA, we have seen significant strides aimed at making women active players in the blue economy industry. Mr. President is desirous of seeing more women play active role in the maritime industry. This celebration focusing on women seafarers is, therefore, apt.” She urged all government agencies, especially those in the maritime sector, to ensure the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 5, which is aimed at attaining gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.
