The Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday restrained the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from removing Mr. Wale Tinubu as the Group Chief Executive Officer of Oando Plc. It also barred SEC from imposing a fine on Tinubu and carrying out its restriction on him and his deputy, Mr. Omamofe Boyo, from being directors of public companies for five years. Ruling on an ex-parte application filed by Tinubu and Boyo through their lawyers Mr Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), Yele Delano (SAN) and Motunrayo Akinyemi, Justice Mojisola Olatoregun ordered parties to maintain status quo. SEC had on Friday announced the conclusion of an investigation of Oando and ordered Tinubu and other affected board members to resign. The apex capital market regulator also said it barred Tinubu and Boyo from being directors of public companies for a period of five years. It went further to say on Sunday that it had set up an interim management team headed by Mr Mutiu Sunmonu to oversee the company’s affairs and to conduct an Extraordinary General Meeting on or before July 1 to appoint new directors to the board, who would subsequently select a management team. Tinubu and Boyo have filed a suit to challenge the SEC decision. In their ex-parte application, they sought, among others, an order of interim injunction: Tinubu and Boyo also prayed the court for an interim injunction restraining SEC or its agents from requesting any agency of government to act upon the decision contained in the May 31 letter pending the hearing and determination of their motion on notice. The application was supported by an affidavit deposed to by Boyo. After hearing the applicants’ counsel, Justice Olatoregun ruled that: The case was adjourned till June 14.
