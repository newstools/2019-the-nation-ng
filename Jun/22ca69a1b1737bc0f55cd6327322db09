Eat’N’Go Limited, the franchisee for food Domino’s Pizza, Cold Stone Creamery and Pinkberry Gourmet Frozen Yoghurt, has opened its 100th outlet in the country. This is coming after the renovation and re-opening of its Yaba, Lagos outlet. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer, Patrick McMichael, expressed gratitude to the employees, customers, partners and the public for their loyalty and support over the years. “We are excited to be celebrating the opening of our 100th store in Nigeria. This is a huge accomplishment for us, especially because we achieved this in seven years. We are also grateful to the operating environment for helping us excel in our business even in the midst of challenges. We have experienced goodwill from staffs, and particularly our customers who have been there for us, as we continue to grow as a quick service restaurant in Nigeria,” he said. The company started operations in 2012 with the opening of its Saka Tinubu store with the brands Domino’s Pizza and Cold Stone creamery. From its humble beginnings, the company has since further expanded to several regions across the country, including Port Harcourt, Abuja, Enugu, Ilorin, Akure and Ibadan.
