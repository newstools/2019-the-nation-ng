Former UEFA president Michel Platini has been arrested on Tuesday in relation to the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. The French football legend was arrested by French anti-corruption police investigating the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to the gas-rich Gulf state. Qatar was named to host the World Cup in a decision that triggered controversy over its suitability amid allegations of corruption. 63 -year-old Platini, led UEFA until 2015 when he was banned from football for four years for ethics violations including receiving a two-million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) payment from the disgraced former head of FIFA Sepp Blatter. Qatar has been accused of buying votes in its bid to stage the World Cup and a subsequent report by US independent investigator Michael Garcia unearthed an array of suspect financial dealings, many linked to Sandro Rosell, the ex-Barcelona president who served as a consultant for Qatar.
