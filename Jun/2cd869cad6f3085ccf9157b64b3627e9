The Department of State Services (DSS) on Wednesday denied arresting Edward Onoja, an aide of Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello. The DSS said a media report (not The Nation’s) claiming otherwise was false. It stated this in a statement ‘Edward Onoja not arrested by the DSS’ signed by its Public Relations Officer (PRO) PN. Afunaya. It reads: “The said news (relating to the arrest of Onoja) is fake and misleading and should be disregarded as the DSS never carried out such operation. “The Service recognises that the media is a strategic partner in nation-building and hopes that cordiality and mutual respectability are maintained in the relationship between them. “In this vein, it wishes to advise that stories are verified or authenticated before their publication. “It, however, warns that persons or organisations that falsely use the name of the Service will be liable to prosecution. “The DSS will, no doubt, continue to collaborate with all well meaning stakeholders to ensure that peace and order are maintained, not only in Kogi State but every part of the country.”
