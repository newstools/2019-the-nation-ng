Comedian Francis Agoda, aka I Go Dye, has congratulated the newly elected Deputy Senate President for the 9th National Assembly, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, urging him to use his position to see to the reopening of seaports as a way of boosting employment and curbing youth restiveness across Nigeria. According to the Warri-born humour merchant, “ It’s another step further into our democratic process with the inauguration of 9th Assembly. The emergence of the major house leaders have set the ball rolling. Obviously,  one interesting  outcome is the election of  one of Delta State’s representative in the person of  Hon Bar .Omo-Agege as the Deputy Senate President. I feel this will grant the Honourable Deputy Senate President an opportunity to reflect on my prior acknowledgment of the proceedings, when I wrote to you for God to grant you the honour of becoming the next Senate President, so that you could work in the path of nobility and accord a friendly disposition to the governor of Delta State. The level of development which is desired in Delta State, honestly requires the collective responsibility and support of every one. We cannot achieve the goal of development without  a cooperation of oneness and  above  partisan affiliations. “Today you have been elected as the Deputy Senate President, I want you to understand that  the unforeseen  revelations of yesterday have manifested timely. This opportunity granted you as I stated before to use this opportunity to advance the reopening of the seaports across Nigeria ,which has been neglected and have suffered several setbacks in the past. We cannot have minister of transport and a Deputy Senate President  and our seaports are not working . There cannot be a better moment  to work out a framework that will  bring sustainable development through the seaports to curb youths restiveness and unemployment across Nigeria.”
