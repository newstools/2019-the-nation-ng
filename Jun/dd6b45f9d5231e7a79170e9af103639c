Leicester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho and Semi Ajayi of English club Rotherham United are the two players dropped by Coach Gernot Rohr from the Super Eagles’ 23-man squad to the Egypt 2019 African Cup of Nations (AFCON). Iheanacho has struggled for game time at his Premier League club, while defensive midfielder Semi Ajayi was up against more experienced players who play at bigger clubs. Rohr has earlier this week hinted that club form will be a major determinant on the final squad to Egypt 2019. Top officials have reportedly ordered that Iheanacho should be on the flight to Egypt, but Rohr insisted that there is fierce competition among the strikers on the squad and ‘gifts’ will not be handed to any player. He also said Iheanacho is lacking self-belief and has been unhappy. Rohr did not play the former Manchester City star in the warm-up against Zimbabwe to finally seal his decision to leave him out of the party to Egypt. The squad arrived Ismaila from Asaba aboard a chartered flight. The Eagles will set up training base in Ismailia, where they will play a final warm-up game against Senegal on Sunday, June 16.
