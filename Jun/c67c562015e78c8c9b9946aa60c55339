A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Behind Bars Rights Foundation (BBRF), on Monday staged a protest against the alleged rape of a two-year-old girl by a 52-year-old landlord, Emeka Okwuosa. The defilement reportedly occurred in Nsukwa community in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State. The Nation gathered that the victim’s father left his daughter under the care of his 12-year-old son, Sunday, while he went to work. The landlord allegedly sent Sunday on an errand in order to carry out his plan. On his return, Sunday met the suspect with the victim, who was crying and bleeding from the private part. BBRF’s Director General Harrison Gwamnishu, who led a protest on major streets of Asaba, the state capital, alleged that when the matter was reported at the divisional police station at Nsukwa, the 12-year-old boy was detained for five days. In a joint petition to the police commissioner, Gwamnishu and another official of the NGO, Ikechukwu Omenogor, alleged that the police tortured Sunday by hitting his leg with baton. They said the baby was taken back to the hospital, adding that the suspect was later arrested. According to the petitioners, the parents of the victim have spent money travelling to Asaba without any sign of justice, hence, the protest for the police authorities to take action. “Sir, we call on you to get fully involved in this case for proper investigation in the interest of justice, equity and good conscience,” the petition said. The NGO urged the state government to consider the payment of compensation to rape victims, saying getting justice was no longer enough in view of the stigmatisation such victims face in the society.
