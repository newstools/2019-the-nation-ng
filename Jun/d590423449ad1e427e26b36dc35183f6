Lithuania’s Defence Minister Raimundas Karoblis on Thursday welcomed U.S. plans to send more troops to Poland, saying the move would increase the security of the entire region. “Not only Poland will profit from the deployment, but all Baltic States,’’ Karoblis told BNS news agency. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda announced plans on Wednesday to increase the U.S. military presence in Poland by up to 2,000 additional troops. The forces may be drawn from those already stationed in Germany or another location somewhere in Europe. A final decision on troop numbers has not yet been announced. “We think the number of troops attending exercises in Lithuania will increase. “We think it will grow and that is a direct contribution to our security,’’ Karoblis said. NATO member Lithuania and its Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia have previously underlined their safety concerns in relation to the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Washington already stepped up its military presence in Poland in 2017 and has some 4,500 troops in the country on a rotational basis. (NAN)
