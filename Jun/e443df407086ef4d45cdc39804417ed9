OGUN State Governor Dapo Abiodun has constituted a committee to look into the operation of Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology, Abeokuta and Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia. Abiodun, in a  statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Kunle Somorin, stated that the committee has become necessary because the state-owned Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY) has been comatose since the Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology, Abeokuta and Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia were created. The governor added that as a result of the unresolved issues, the fate of candidates and students of MAPOLY and their lecturers now hang in a balance while academic activities have also been disrupted. He, therefore,  ordered that MAPOLY should revert to status quo ante with full academic activities restored as the committee determines the way forward for the new institutions. “As a responsible government, we cannot fold our arms and allow the situation to continue. “We cherish human capital development. This committee is, therefore, set up to holistically review the status, viability and sustainability of these newly established institutions,” said the governor. The review committee is expected to recommend operational modalities for these institutions after interfacing with stakeholders in the education sector. The committee headed by the former Vice-Chancellor of Tai Solarin University of Education, Prof. Segun Awonusi, has the following terms of reference: ascertain the current operational status of Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology, Abeokuta and Ogun State Polytechnic. Ipokia; identify issues and challenges related to the establishment and operations of the two institutions; determine the viability and sustainability of the institutions on a long term basis; and identify any other issue(s) related to the objectives of the assignment; and make recommendations for the consideration of the Government.
