Ohanaeze Ndigbo on Thursday reacted to the forceful acquisition of land by the Federal Government in Benue state for the RUGA settlement. In a terse statement by its president general, Chief Nnia Nwodo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization said: “The Federal government violation of provisions of our constitution on the administrative of land in Nigeria, its total violation of valid laws made by Benue State Government in accordance with her inherent powers under our constitution and its violations of extant court judgment on grazing and ranching is a clear pointer to anarchy. “When respect for the rule of law is jettisoned, and sheer power, religious bigotry and nepotism displayed, an inevitable resort to self help and anarchy is being courted. “Our country is sliding into avoidable anarchy and doom!”
