Olakunle Churchill, the estranged husband of Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has found love in the bosom of a white woman. Strangely, the white woman shares the same birthday date with his ex-wife, Tonto Dikeh. Churchill took to Instagram on Sunday to wish his new found love a happy birthday. He wrote: “All of your days in this lifetime should be spent with nothing less than ordinary. An extraordinary person like you deserves a birthday much better than the last one combined. Happy birthday my love #quietqueen.” Churchill was married to Tonto Dikeh in 2015 and divorced her in 2017. The marriage produced a child-Andre Omodayo Churchill. NAN
