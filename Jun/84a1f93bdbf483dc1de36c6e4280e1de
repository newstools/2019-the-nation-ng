Traditional rulers in Ondo State have decried the arbitrary use of royal regalia by non-monarchs. At their monthly meeting in Akure, the state capital, the royal fathers resolved to take the issue with all seriousness it deserved. The chairman of the Council of Obas, who is also the Olukare of Ikare, Oba Akadiri Momoh, observed with dismay that the paraphernalia of office meant for obashipâ€™s institution had been hijacked. According to him, they are now in possession of ordinary people on the streets, describing it as obnoxious and desecration of the institution of obaship. The council noted that the regalia were now been worn by various people, including some religious leaders, cult leaders as well as some self-styled traditional rulers. Such costumes include crowns, beaded staff, peculiar beads and others synonymous with royal fathers. The traditional rulers held that the development has become worrisome and a clear violation of the laws of the state, which borders on impersonation as entrenched in section 18(2) of the state chiefs law encapsulated in year 2006 laws of ondo State. Calling on those involved in such criminal act to desist henceforth, the council resolved to formally intimate the state government as well as relevant security agencies to bring recalcitrant culprits to book.
