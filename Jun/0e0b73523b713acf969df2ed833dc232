The joy of residents of Agric, Ojo Town, Mosafejo, Ilufe and Ilugbemi in Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos State knew no bound on Thursday as they received five 500 KVA transformers to boost power supply in their areas. The council Chairman, Mr Rasulu Olusola Idowu, gave them the transformers. The Nation learnt that some of the communities have been in darkness for months. Others are not enjoying regular power supply because of their obsolete transformers. Idowu said the essence of governance was to bring succor to the people, noting that the transformers were part of his electoral promises to the communities. He advised the beneficiaries to see the transformers as their personal property and protect the equipment. “Doing this will encourage us to extend the gesture to other communities. Though, our interventions were based on the need of each community,” he said. “Already, we have called the executives of the Community Development Associations (CDAs) and told them about the donation. We have equally inscribed the council’s name on the transformers to prevent extortion. Our officials will also go to the communities to monitor the transformers’ installation. We are not going to stop at this. We hope to extend the gesture to other communities in need.” he said. “This administration will continue to embark on cogent programmes and projects that will put smiles on the faces of our people. Already, we have recorded laudable achievements in the area of education, infrastructure, poverty alleviation, health, and sports among others,” he added. The Community Development Community (CDC) Chairman, Niyi Makinde appealed to the community leaders not to use the transformers to extort money from residents. The Baales of Ilufe Chief Hassan Yusuf, Mosafejo – Chief Lawal Okin and Ilugbemi Chief Habeeb Yusuf also thanked the council chief for the “unusual gesture.”
