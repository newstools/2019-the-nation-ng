The 37 teachers recently sacked at the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education {AOCOED}, Ijanikin, Lagos State, have implored Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to save them from salvation and untimely death. Their spokesman, Gabriel Oguntuase, told reporters in Ijanikin, Lagos, on Friday that they were initially employed as workers of the institution. He said they were later transferred to teach in the primary and secondary school sections of the institution, adding that the remaining workers were given harmonization letters as bonafide officials of the college. Oguntuase said their ordeal began in 2010 when their promotions in the two schools were stopped. “We wrote many letters to the management on the matter but got no response. “This continued until 2015 when our salaries were reduced by more than half and all the benefits due to us as statutory employees were taken away. “From then, we were deprived of all allowances, including annual increment. “Then on May 2, 2019 the council and management of the institution terminated our employment, giving redundancy as reason,” he said. Oguntuase appealed to Governor Sanwo-Olu and other Lagosians to intervene and save them from the inhuman treatment meted out to them. Said he: “We have worked diligently in the institution between 10 and 27 years, with letters of recommendation given to us by the management council of the school. “We have our appointment, confirmation and promotion letters duly signed by the college. AOCOED should not be allowed to take away what belongs to us.”
