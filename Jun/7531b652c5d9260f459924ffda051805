THE Director-General, National Environmental Standards and Regulation Enforcement Agency (NESREA), Prof Aliu Jauro has called on electronics manufacturers to be responsible for their entire manufacturing circle to protect lives. He said e-waste can pose a lot of danger to the environment and especially those who eke out a living from it if not properly handled. He spoke at a seminar jointly organised by NESREA, global environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) titled: Circular economy approaches for the electronics sector in Nigeria in Lagos. He said the agency is collaborating with donor agencies, Computer Village,Â  Ikeja, Alaba Market, importers and those who pick the disuused electronics products from dump sites for money. According to him, the idea is to create wealth from waste while preserving lives through adequate legislation and advocacy interventions.
