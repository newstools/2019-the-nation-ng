West Africa’s premier connectivity and data centre solutions provider, MainOne, said it has absorbed 36 graduates of the second batch of its Bright Minds Graduate Trainee Programme. The two-month intensive training  was designed to groom fresh graduates into highly skilled technical professionals by taking them through the fundamentals of the company’s various business functions as well as the personal effectiveness skills they need to survive in today’s work place before their recruitment into the company. The programme combined classroom style learning with practical sessions facilitated by seasoned external consultants and specialists within MainOne to help the trainees understand the company’s core functions, which include connectivity and managed cloud services. The programme culminated in a five-week certification training to provide the trainees with specialised technical skills required for their various roles. Over 2,600 men and women were  encouraged to apply with six women after successfully completing the programme to join MainOne’s Technical Department. Celebrating the success of the programme at a ceremony, the Head, Corporate Services, MainOne, Tinuola Ipadeola, congratulated the recruits on the completion of the programme and urged them not to relent on their oars as they strive for excellence in their new roles. “On behalf of MainOne, I would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to our new recruits following their successful completion of the Bright Minds Graduate Trainee Programme from a pool of over 2,600 applicants.
