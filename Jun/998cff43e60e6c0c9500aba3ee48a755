Truckrtech, an online marketplace for listing and booking of third-party trucks, has won N1 million equity-free funding as the top startup from  Pitch2Win, 2019 edition held in Lagos. Pitch2Win is a competition launched by TechCircle,  in partnership with Japan’s FreakOut Holdings, to find the most disruptive startups in Nigeria, and give them local and international investment opportunities. Founded last year by Caryl Joshua Akonor, Truckrtech gives real-time visibility, cargo-in-transit insurance and proper communication channels to shippers and drivers. Call for application made early in May got over 200 entries across Africa. This was followed by a rigorous screening session, then selection of 10 finalists, culminating in the grand finale where selected startups had to battle for N1 million equity-free funding. The winning startup, TruckrTech, fought its way through to beat other three impressive startups, all aiming for the grand prize. Judges were impressed with its scalability potential to multiply its trucks, and expand services beyond Ghana. “We did our pilot between January and April, and started full operations in May 2019. “Between May and June, we’ve done $12,000 in revenue. We can look to 15 per cent  month on month revenue increase with this funding from Pitch2Win, Caryl Joshua Akonor, Founder”, TruckrTech said.
