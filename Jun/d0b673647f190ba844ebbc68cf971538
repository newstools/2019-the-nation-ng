The Abuja branch of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) has called on the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) to intensify its Engineering Regulation Monitoring (ERM). The Chairman of NSE in Abuja, Mr Chinasaokwu Okoli, made the call in a statement by Mrs Ojonugwa Haruna, the COREN’s Head of Public Relations on Sunday in Abuja. He made the call during a courtesy visit to COREN President, Ali Rabiu. Okoli urged COREN president and his management team to exploit every opportunity available to the council to sharpen the operations of ERM.   According to him, ERM is currently operating without powers to prosecute offenders and will therefore, not be taken seriously. He called on the president to work with a vibrant team that would help to promote the activities of the council and address issues among its members and other professional bodies. Okoli pledged the readiness of the NSE Abuja branch to offer necessary support to COREN and urged the president to be part of the branch’s Annual General Meeting slated for August. He said the visit was to register solidarity and support of the Abuja branch of NSE for the administration of Rabiu as the president of COREN. Rabiu commended the delegation for the visit, adding that with the accent of President Muhammadu Buhari to the amended COREN Act, the council was currently in a better position to empower its ERM. He said that COREN had inaugurated a 16-member strategic implementation committee to come up with a road map for the implementation of the act.
