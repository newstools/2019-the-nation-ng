An Ikeja Special Offences Court Thursday granted bail to three former executives of the Ikeja Branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), alleged to have defrauded the association of N20.1 million. Justice Mojisola Dada, while ruling on their bail applications, granted former chairmen, Adesina Ogunlana and Yinka Farounbi and former treasurer Aderinola Kappo bail in the sum of N500, 000 each with two sureties in like sum. They are first, second and third defendants respectively in the suit filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged “conspiracy to steal”. The judge held that there was no reason to deny the defendants bail as the EFCC failed to provide proof that they would jump bail or tamper with evidences and witnesses. She said: “The allegation that the three defendants jumped administrative bail was not proven; although the first and third defendants said they were not around last Friday that they were supposed to appear before the EFCC. “They, however, presented themselves for arraignment the following Monday, despite not being served by the EFCC,” she noted. The judge also held that the EFCC investigated the claims of the third defendant that she was in a hospital in Badagry on that Friday. “The EFCC also failed to produce the second defendant in court for arraignment, despite being in EFCC custody up until then. “The defendants are granted bail in the sum of N500, 000 and two sureties in like sum, one of whom must own a landed property within the jurisdiction of the court. “The defendants shall remain on temporary bail, pending the perfection of their bail within two weeks, failure of which they will be remanded in prison.” Justice Dada adjourned the case until July 3, 9 and 10 for trial. Ogunlana is facing a 15-counts of stealing and a count of money laundering while Farounbi and Kappo are jointly charged with 13-counts of stealing. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
