A High Court sitting in Ilorin on Wednesday sentenced three internet fraudsters to a year each for fraud. The convicts Akeem Mustapha, Abolarin Sunday and Murtala Abdulrasheed were sentenced by Justice Mahmud Abdulgafar after plea bargain agreement with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). At the resumed hearing on Wednesday, the Prosecutor, Andrew Akoja told the court that the defendants had entered into a plea bargain agreement with the commission. Counsel to the defendants, S.O Babakebe, however, confirmed the plea bargain agreement. Abdulgafar, while sentencing the convicts, said: “In view of the plea bargain agreement dated June 25, the defendants are hereby sentenced to a year imprisonment. “The sentence is effective from February 12, when they were arrested, and all the items recovered from them are hereby forfeited to the Federal Government.”. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the convicts were arraigned on June 24. They were tried for fraud by posing as women on the internet with the intent to defraud unsuspecting internet users a representation the defendants knew was false. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Section 95 of the penal code law and punishable under section 324 of the same law. (NAN)
