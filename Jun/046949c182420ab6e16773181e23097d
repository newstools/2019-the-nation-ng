Prof Oloyede said this during the 4tth convocation lecture of Federal University, Dutse, Jigawa state at the weekend. The registrar, in the board’s Weekly Bulletin released by JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, said efforts should be geared towards developing existing ones in the country. According to him, universities should not be established just to boost the ego of rich individuals and politicians. He said: “A situation where universities are only established to massage the ego of rich individuals and politicians is not healthy for educational development of the country as tertiary education is too crucial to be reduced to a commercial outfit for an ego-tripping venture. “Since education is everybody’s business, all Nigerians should support the effort towards educational development. Oloyede who took a critical look at the recommendations of the 2017 Presidential Retreat on Education which recommended a declaration of a state of emergency in the education sector, advocated increased funding of education in the country by committing nothing less than 15% of the national budget to the sector.
