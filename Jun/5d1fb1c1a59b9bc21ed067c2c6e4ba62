The Police have killed Mafutau Timileyin Sulaimon alias Pencil, described as a notorious kidnapper, in a gun battle. He fell under the susperior fire power of the police on Sunday night in Ikorodu, Lagos. Pencil was said to be the leader of the gang that killed two Bureau De Change (BDC) operators and two others at Odogunyan in Ikorodu on March 14 after collecting N1.6m ransom from the money changers. The bodies were recovered from a septic tank following the arrest of three members of the gang. It was gathered that the police stormed his hideout around 9:10pm and he allegedly opened fire on the team. Sergeants Omola Adedeji and Oluwadare Gbenga of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) were hit. In a statement yesterday,  police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said Pencil’s gang was behind the mysterious disappearance of some people in Ikorodu over a period of time. Elkana said: “They are serial killers, rapists and cultists. Three members of his gang were earlier arrested by SARS operatives and they led detectives to their den at Ikorodu where corpses of the two BDC operators and two other victims were recovered. A sustained monitoring of the fugitive ring leader finally yielded positive results as the team eventually traced him to his hideout at Odogunyan, Ikorodu. “On sighting the team led by DSP Rotimi Ogunmuyiwa, Pencil engaged them in a gun battle. Two SARS operatives – Sergeants Adedeji and Gbenga – sustained various degrees of injuries, while Pencil sustained bullet wound on his legs. They were all taken to the hospital and the said Pencil was confirmed dead on arrival. “The two injured operatives were taken to Intensive Care Unit and are responding to treatment. One gun with live ammunition as well as an expended ammunition were recovered.”
