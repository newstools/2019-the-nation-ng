President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision not to speak during his inauguration for a second term at the Eagle Square in Abuja on Wednesday should not be a subject of controversy or public debate , a former deputy governor of Lagos State, Alhaja Sinatu Ojikutu has declared. Ojikutu in a statement issued in Lagos today, said “President Buhari’s decision to keep mum, and not to talk during the inauguration is a good departure from the usual tradition where his statements are twisted out of context. Buhari’s decision should not be a subject of needless debates.” “Most of those speaking against the President are not sincere. They are not genuine patriots. Most of them are hypocrites, while others are those who don’t see anything good in Buhari’s administration. Buhari should not be distracted. He should be allowed to do the work for which Nigerians have elected him for a second term in office. I urge the President to remain focused, and forge ahead with his transformation agenda,” she declared. Appealing to newly inaugurated public office holders to see their new appointments as avenues to serve, Ojikutu said “I humbly appeal to all newly inaugurated public office holders to be service-oriented. They should know that they were sworn-in to serve, and not to loot or steal. They should be diligent, and not self-serving. People’s welfare and interests should always be their focus.”
