Youcef Belaili scored the solitary goal against Senegal that has sealed Algeria’s place in the Round of sixteen of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations The Desert Foxes become the third African team to make it to the knockout rounds. They join Nigeria and Egypt, after securing their first back-to-back AFCON victory since 1990. Mane was unfortunate not to win a penalty when he was sandwiched by Adlene Guedioura and Ramy Bensebaini with 20 minutes to go. This raised questions about the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) that will not be in use until the quarter-final stage. The game did not live up to the hype, with Senegal not having a shot on target until the 78th minute when Youssouf Sabaly’s 20-yard shot was parried by Rais M’Bolhi and Mbaye Diagne put the rebound wide from close range. Stoke City midfielder Badou Ndiaye blazed a shot over for Senegal just after the hour-mark and Mahrez, in a rare moment of magic, lashed an effort just wide from long range. BBCSports
