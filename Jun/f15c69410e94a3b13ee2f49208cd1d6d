Some community leaders in Badagry have warned residents to beware of people parading themselves as agents of pre-paid meter providers. The leaders of Magbon in Olorunda Local Council Development Area (LCDA) advised Tologbo, Oke Morosun , Akanbisi, Obele, Poshe, Irete , Okekere, Oko Agbon Nla, and Oke Agbon Kekere residents to steer clear of the Landlords and Tenants Association of Nigeria, Magbon Branch. The association, they said, was out to extort money from the residents. Their spokesperson Bola Mujeeb, said it was the same group that used some landlords and tenants to stage a “No-prepaid meter, no payment protest” against the Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), Agbara/Badagry District last year, collecting N1500 from residents for “logistics and other irrelevances” without any dividend. He said: “After generating nearly a million naira, the so-called association, later connived with some EKEDC officials and frustrated the residents’ efforts. “That was when the community’s dream of prepaid meters would have been realised, but because they bowed to EKEDC officials and agreed to make 60 per cent of the then current charge plus Value Added Tax (VAT), the community missed out on that opportunity; in addition to one whole week blackout.” The association, he said, had started going round again to collect money from the residents for the same purpose. “It is in the light of this that we are appealing to the appropriate authorities such as Morogbo Station and Area K Police Command to wade in and truncate the group’s activities before the situation gets chaotic. We are also demanding that the group be made to refund the money collected so far,” he said. A leader, Comrade Peter Awoyemi, described the group as dubious, warning residents not to associate with it. The association’s Financial Secretary, Olu Ajimosun, told our reporter on phone that they did not collect money from anybody.
