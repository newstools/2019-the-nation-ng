Zimbabwe head coach Sunday Chidzambwa has spoken about Egypt ahead of their clash in the opening game of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (AFCON). The warriors are set to face hosts Egypt on Friday in Group A’s first match. This group also includes DR Congo and Uganda. Speaking ahead of their clash in a press conference, Chidzambwa said that Egypt are the favourites to win the 2019 AFCON having won the cup seven times in total and this experience will help them win this year’s tournament. The 67-year-old also acknowledges how the Pharaohs being the hosts of the 2019 AFCON gives them an advantage over other teams. “We know how strong Egypt are especially when they play at home and the fans on their side supporting them throughout the competition,” said Chidzambwa. Chidzambwa also went on to praise his side for their hard work to qualify for the 2019 AFCON, saying: “Zimbabwe  was among 24 other teams fighting for AFCON qualification.” “Now that we are in the AFCON group stages, we will work hard to get the best possible results in all our games,” he concluded.
