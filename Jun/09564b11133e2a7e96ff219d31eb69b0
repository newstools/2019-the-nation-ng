The governorship campaign outfit of the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri on Friday faulted the composition of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly leadership describing it as unequal and unfair. The Heineken Lokpobiri Campaign Organisation (HLCO) wondered why Ogbia Local Government Area was excluded from the leadership structure of the House. The outfit said its investigations revealed that the entire Bayelsa East Senatorial District where Ogbia is located, got one out of the six leadership positions. HLCO said the action of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was a testament of its hatred for Ogbia people. The Director-General, HLCO, Hon. Warman Ogoriba, in a statement in Yenagoa said it was inconceivable that the PDP dominated House treated Ogbia with disdain without recourse to the principles of balance and fairness. He accused the current PDP government in the state of deliberately marginalising Ogbia in its distribution of positions in the state House of Assembly. He said: “We are highly disappointed that Ogbia has become the weeping child of the PDP in the distribution of positions as the current action of the House has confirmed. “While we sympathize with Ogbia for its marginalization under a PDP government, we want to assure the people of Bayelsa that APC believes in justice and fairness and inclusive engagement of all our people. We are offering the people of Ogbia and Bayelsans in general fair treatment when APC takes over government in Bayelsa”.
