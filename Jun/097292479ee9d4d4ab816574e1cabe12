I was going through Instagram this morning, when I stumbled upon this post on a relationship platform . The story reads: ‘’Some of you might think I am mental, but I am very normal. Bom I love my husband beating me, I enjoy seeing him angry. Don’t call me crazy it is just my person . He use to beat the living day light out of me and sometimes I bleed but I still survive it . We have lived like that for 2 years and he has killed 3 of my unborn kids out of that but I don’t mind, God will give us more . But now he has repeated and found Christ according to him and he has become too calm. He does not shout or raise his hand on me again and the marriage is now full. So I met this tanker driver that use to beat me and give me money , I love the guy so much because he is too strong . Bom I am pregnant and I don’t know if should keep it because my husband has not touched me since he found Jesus.’’ What is your advice for this young lady?
