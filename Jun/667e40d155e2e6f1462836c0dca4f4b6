A public servant in Osun State, Mr. Adenipekun Ademiju, was shot dead on Thursday by unknown gunmen on Ife-Ibadan Expressway. The gunmen, suspected to be herdsmen, were said to have attempted to rob motorists at Ikire when the victim’s vehicle ran into them. Ademiju (aka Okere), a staff of Atakunmosa West Local Government Area, reportedly boarded a private vehicle at Osu to spend the public holiday with his family in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, when stray bullets of the bandits hit him in the head. An eyewitness, who pleaded not to be named, said: “The man was killed by herdsmen who normally rob on this road. Two of them were in the car. I think the bullets missed the gunmen’s target, the driver of the car, before killing the man. The robbers dropped the body on the highway and went away with the car.” Police spokesperson Folashade Odoro said the command had begun investigation into the matter.
