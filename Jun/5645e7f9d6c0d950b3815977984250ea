The Lagos State Government has entered into a major partnership with Gokada, a commercial motorbikes firm, on tree planting project. The agreement was signed by the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) General Manager, Mrs Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola and Mr Kayode Adegbola, GOKADA Director of Government and Regulatory Affairs, in Ikeja on Tuesday. Adebiyi-Abiola said the agreement represents the single largest commitment till date by a private sector player in Nigeria towards tree planting project. She said through the partnership, Gokada will be joining other cooperate institutions to plant 100,000 trees in Lagos over the next five years, starting with 10,000 trees before the end of 2019. “The intention is to bring together 25 forward-looking companies like GOKADA , who are each committed to planting at least 100,000 trees in support of the Agency’s effort on or before the year 2020,” she said. Adegbola said: “This partnership will foster the reduction of atmospheric carbon concentration and flooding. It will also improve the quality of life of Lagosians, for whom we work tirelessly to provide safer and faster intra-city transportation.” He said the company is also working internally to evolve a holistic programme that would significantly cut the carbon footprint across our operations.
