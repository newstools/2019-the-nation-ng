The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) said it has released additional 15,490 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) results it earlier withheld on suspicion of malpractices. The examination body said the results of candidates released included those who had sufficiently proved their innocence and those with inconclusive evidence of culpability in malpractice. According to the board, the decision to release the results followed an expert review of their cases after those affected were asked to upload certain credentials for scrutiny. JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, stated this in a statement yesterday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. He urged the candidates to send RESULT to 55019 to check their results. “In consonance with the promise made by JAMB during the release of the 2019 UTME on Saturday, May 11, that it would further probe the identity and involvement of some candidates who were suspected of being involved in one examination infraction or another, the board has further cleared and released the results of 15,490 candidates in this category. “The release followed the expert review of the cases of this category of candidates who were requested to upload certain credentials for scrutiny. At the conclusion of the review, this category of candidates was further classified into five groups: those who have sufficiently proved their innocence; those with inconclusive evidence of culpability and were given the benefit of the doubt because of the guiding principles of the board that it is better for many criminals to go free than to punish one innocent candidate. “They are to send RESULT to 55019 for their result,” the statement said.
