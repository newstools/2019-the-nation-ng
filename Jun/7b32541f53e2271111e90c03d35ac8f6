Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha on Wednesday inaugurated Interim Management Committees for the 27 local government areas. The appointment takes immediate effect, according to a statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Chibuike Onyeukwu. Ihedioha had earlier suspended all elected chairmen and councillors in line with the recommendations of the House of Assembly. Meanwhile three lawmakers elected on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The lawmakers – Chyna Iwuanyanwu (Nwangele), Chidi Ogbunikpa (Okigwe) and Onyemaechi Njoku (Ihitte Uboma) – said their defection was to enable them serve their constituents better. The speaker, Chiji Collins, read their letters of defections during the plenary. Following their defections, APGA now has just one seat in House of Assembly.
