The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that it will meet to do the needful on the judgment concerning the release of the certificate of returns for Rochas Okorocha. The Commission in a statement noted that as a law abiding institution will obey all court orders. The statement which was signed by Mr. Festus Okoye, National Commissioner & Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, stated that “the Commission will meet as soon as practicable to do the needful”. As a law-abiding institution, the Commission will continue to obey judgements of all courts of competent jurisdiction. “However, the Commission’s overriding consideration is the safety of its ad-hoc staff, Electoral Officers and Collation/Returning Officers and is worried that if electoral impunity is allowed to flourish, any individual can harass, intimidate and put the Commission’s officers under duress, procure a favourable declaration and be rewarded with a Certificate of Return,” he stressed. He also revealed that the commission “has been served with the Order of a High Court of Imo State, presided over by Hon. Justice Njemanze, directing the Commission not to issue a Certificate of Return to any of the candidates that contested the Imo West Senatorial District election. The Order from the High Court of Imo State was issued on 23rd May 2019 and the suit has been further adjourned to 26thJune 2019. “The Commission is aware that the judgement delivered by the Federal High Court, Abuja is the latest in time and determined the rights of the parties in relation to the subject matter of the Certificate of Return, in respect of the Imo West Senatorial Election. ” He however noted that “the Commission is currently undertaking State level reviews of the 2019 general elections and all the National Commissioners are either in or heading to their States of Supervision to coordinate activities relating to the said review. “
