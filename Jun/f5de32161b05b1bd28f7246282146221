Coach Alain Giresse has revealed that Tunisia will aim to reach the quarter-finals of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt later this month. Since their first AFCON triumph in 2004, the North Africans have exited the tournament at the quarter-final stage five times, including the last two editions in 2015 and 2017. For their campaign in Egypt, Tunisia has been placed in Group E against Angola, Mali and Mauritania. Giresse succeeded Nabil Maaloul at the helm last December and he plans to overcome that stumbling block before eyeing the AFCON title with Tunisia. “Now we cannot say that we are capable of winning the title, we should not rush, we need to be realistic and effective and raise our level to say that we are able to win the title,” Giresse told Goal. “Tunisia has been a longtime rival for titles and I am here to complete this road. I am trying to get to this stage as soon as possible. Our goal is to reach the quarter-finals of the tournament and try to overcome it. At that time, we can say that we have presented a good tournament and what remains to be left to the scenario of matches, ambition is to win the title certainly.” The French tactician is looking forward to a more competitive tournament with 24 countries set to battle for glory. While his team aims to overcome their quarter-finals hurdle, Giresse picked the other North African countries as favourites to lift the title. “There are many strong teams. This tournament will be stronger than any previous race but I will nominate Egypt and Morocco in the first place alongside teams such as Senegal, Cameroon, Algeria and Cote d’Ivoire,” he concluded. Ahead of their AFCON campaign, Tunisia have lined up friendly games again Iraq, Croatia and Burundi on June 7, 11 and 17 respectively.
