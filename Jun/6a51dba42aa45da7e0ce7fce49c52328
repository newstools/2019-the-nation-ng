OIL major, Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), said it invested N35billion on social development in the country over the last one decade. Its General Manager of Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Esimaje Brikinn, in a presentation titled: Strategic Social Investment: The Chevron Approach, at the Pan Atlantic University, Lagos, explained that about  N21.6 billion of the cash has impacted over 600,000 lives in more than 400 communities. He said the other N13.7 billion was spent to support educational infrastructural (N2.5billion), 28 Chest Clinics (N2.8billion) while N8.4billion was disbursed to the Agbami Scholarship Awardees. This, according to Brikinn, is designed to drive national development. He added that since the inception of the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) in 2005, relative peace has been enjoyed between the oil giant and its host communities. “Community-induced work disruption reduced significantly since inception of the GMoU. Potentials for conflict reduced in communion and peace building is enhanced,” Brikinn stated. The presentation stated that the five Regional Development Committees spanning Bayelsa, Delta and Ondo states (Dodo River, EGCDF, Ilaje, Itsekiri and KEFFES), were established to foster the social investment of the company on host communities.
