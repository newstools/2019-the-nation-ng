Kwara state Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has denied rumours of his alleged sacking of some workers in the state civil service. The governor added that some category of workers hurriedly employed by the immediate past administration were not paid May salary. In a statement, Deputy Chief Press Secretary to the governor Agboola Olanrewaju said “in view of some misinformation going viral regarding some workers hurriedly engaged by the previous administration, we state the that the Kwara state government has not sacked any worker — new or old. “That the category of workers not paid for the month of May were those who were employed only two or three weeks ago but had their employment letters dubiously backdated to November 2018. “That most of these workers have never been captured on the government’s payroll before — and so couldn’t have been paid May salary; that those appointments are called ‘sunset’ appointments (appointments made by a governor/administration on the eve of departure). “That instead of summary sack, what the government resolved to do is to look at their qualifications and ascertain that they are qualified to be employed. In Ogun, Bauchi and some other states, ‘sunset’ employees were sacked with immediate effect; that former Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed did not deem it fit to employ them until a few weeks to leaving office; that some were employed last week and backdated to November 2018 (last year); that in 2003, former Governor Bukola Saraki sacked all of the late Governor Mohammed Lawal’s sunset appointments and also demoted some civil servants.” The statement added “that a dubious interview process was conducted in which only cronies of the last administration were employed over and above those that excelled with flying colours. “We state again that these sunset workers have *not* been sacked; their employment status will be looked into and salaries reinstated for those above board.”
