The Nigerian Union of Pensioners has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to expedite action on the release and payment of the N22.6 billion meant for the payment of Pensioners of the Nigeria Airways by directing appropriate authorities charged with the responsibility of the payment to do the needful. In a statement signed by the National President, Dr. Abel Afolayan and General Secretary, Elder Actor Zal, the NUP expressed appreciation to the President for the approval of the money which was supposed to be paid in three tranches but is concerned about the delay in enforcing the payment. The statement reads: “The Nigeria Union of Pensioners, the umbrella body of all pensioners in Nigeria hereby congratulates President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) and the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (GCON) on their swearing-in for a well-deserved second term in office. “Equally, the Union wishes to express her profound gratitude to the President, for the approval and release of the sum of N22.6 billion to pay the balance of pension of the defunct Nigeria Airways Limited having paid the first tranche about three months ago. “It is fundamentally true that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. It is exciting that after passing through the dark years in the hands of past administrations, President Muhammadu Buhari has shown that he is a true leader and lover of Nigerian pensioners as evidenced by this exciting and magnanimous gesture. “In line with the above, we hereby urge Mr. President to expedite action on the release and payment of this money to the curious pensioners by directing appropriate authorities charged with the responsibility of the payment. “The NUP, therefore, wishes the President long life, good health and wisdom to continue to pilot the affairs of Nigeria into safety in his second term of office, taken into consideration the enormous challenges ahead.”
