 Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang may have failed in his bid to qualify The Panthers for the forthcoming Nations cup in Egypt, but the Arsenal striker is on the verge of a mouthwatering move to China. Reports emerged on Tuesday that Chinese clubs are keen to sign him and are willing to pay big money to do so. With a £300,000 per week deal on the table in a transfer potentially worth £80million, Arsenal may have a battle on their hands to keep hold of their star striker. The money bag on the table is already causing division among Arsenal fans while club management is yet to comment or take a decision on the matter Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter urging the club to take the deal, and invest the money elsewhere in the team. ’80 mill for a 30 year old? Why not?’ Asked on Arsenal fan, while another was much more blunt, saying: ‘Sell. Must raise funds. We have Laca.’ Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette proved to be quite a potent strike force for Arsenal last season, despite some woes elsewhere in the team. Aubameyang scored 22 league goals, sharing the Golden Boot along with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Lacazette added 13 to Arsenal’s total. ‘Bite their hand off I say,’ said another Twitter user, with others calling for Arsenal to up the price even more to £90million and ‘spend it all on defence.’ Aubameyang has been a long-term target for teams in China and the fact Arsenal missed out on the Champions League means they believe he could be tempted to leave the Emirates Stadium. Now Guangzhou Evergrande and Shanghai SIPG have gone back in for Aubameyang, who has been approached over transfers to China twice before. Guangzhou attempted to sign him in a £62million switch just weeks before he moved to Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund back in January 2018. Tianjin Quanjian had agreed a £71m move for the Gabonese striker six months prior, but the move fell to pieces after the transfer window closed.
