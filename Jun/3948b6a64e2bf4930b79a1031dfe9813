The Edo State Police Command has urged aggrieved parties in the leadership crisis rocking the Edo State House of Assembly to seek redress in a competent court of law. This came as the Joint Action for the Advancement of Democracy in Edo (JAADE) sought for police patrol for a peaceful march to register its disappointment over perceived skewed inauguration of the Edo State House of Assembly. A statement signed by Assistant Commissioner of Police in Edo State, Tunde Sunmonu, said the Police Commissioner disapproved any form of prosession for now. The statement said the Police Commissioner advised any aggrieved party to seek redress in court. Leader of JAADE, Comrade Aiyamenkhue Edokpolo, who briefed journalists after aborting the procession called for immediate and unconditional restoration of an ideal democratic order where proper inauguration for the 24 members-elect would be done. Edokpolo said the inauguration of only nine members was an assault on the psyche of Edo people. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the Edo State House of Assembly revert to the true dictates of the rule of law and nip in the bud any foreseen breakdown of law and order. Edokpolo stated that the installation of minority rule in the Edo Assembly was uncivilized, barbaric and threat to democracy and peace. According to him, “Political desperados should not be allowed to mar our Democratic trajectory else we all regret the repercussions of our pseudo complacency. “We condemn in strong terms all the varying tendencies behind this impasse.”
