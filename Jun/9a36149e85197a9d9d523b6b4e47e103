Speaking during his visit in the spirit of Ramadan, the Emir urged the inmates to consider their stay at the prison as a will of God and period to reflect on their conduct and learn lesson. He advised them to make good use of the remaining Ramadan period to seek Allah’s forgiveness and intervention. He also charged them to be of good behaviour to avoid any act that would drag them back to the prison.
