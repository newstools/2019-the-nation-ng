The National Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Yabagi Sani has said that by saying that soldiers fighting the Boko Haran insurgents were not disciplined, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Tukur Buratai has indicted himself and the President, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari. He said the position of the Army Chief underscores the position the Party which it has consistently maintained, pointing out that it has become incumbent on the Commander in Chief to as a matter of National importance, relieve all Service Chiefs of the positions as they have been kept beyond their terms of engagement. He said “How can there be discipline and commitment when the soldiers are not properly kitted, allowances not regularly paid and lack of confidence of the President in the established succession plan in the leadership of the service. “It is inexplicable that the security situation which was described as bad and unacceptable during the previous administration is now at it’s worst ebb under the leadership of a former military General and Head of State. “The Chief of Army Staff has by this damning statement agreed that he no longer enjoys the support and loyalty of his men and has lost complete control of the force. The President, at this juncture, should as a matter of National urgency, do the needful and appoint new Service Chiefs to boost morale and motivate the rank and file.
