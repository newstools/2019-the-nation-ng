With six points and two goals in the kitty in two matches Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr may be tempted to rest key players in the last group match against Barea of Madagascar on Sunday. One person who will be watching to see how the match pans out is Rohr’s wife who is from Madagascar. Rohr’s wife who is said to be in the hospitality industry follows the progress of the German sweat merchant in the course of his job but seldom follows him to tournaments. The Eagles got what some called a soft draw after the three time Nations cup winners after they were pitched against two debutants Burundi and Madagascar.  Eagles opening match against Burundi was however not a tea party as the Burundians shunned their underdog status to give Eagles a run for their strength and experience. It took a strike by late substitute Odion Ighalo to rescue the Eagles from what would have ended either in a barren draw of even a surprise defeat. Rohr led Eagles to a disappointing group stage ouster at the last world cup in Russia with some soccer fans in the country insisting that he has to aim at winning the Nations cup to make up for the poor run in Russia. The former Niger and Burkina Faso coach has however insisted that the Eagles are not the favorites to clinch the title tipping hosts Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal instead as hot favorites. Madagascar who held Guinea to a 2-2 draw in their opening match will Thursday face Burundi in what has been dubbed battle of debutants at the Alexandria Stadium.
