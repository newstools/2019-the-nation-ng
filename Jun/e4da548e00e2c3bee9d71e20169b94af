The Arabs hold that to flee your fate is to rush to find it. There are moments in the life of a country when the road not taken return to haunt with a savage insistence. A substantial part of the future is embedded in the past. In such circumstances, memory seems to play a grand trick. These are moments when what is happening cannot be distinguished from what has happened; when the past appears fully dressed as the present. This is the price a nation must pay for recurrent crises in which what has come to the fore is a mere variation of what has gone before. In such a situation, it is often important to step aside sometimes and look back in order to gain fresher insights into the present. While never overlooking the grave dangers to the society arising from new variations of ancient problems, one must also never succumb to the ethnic projects and projections of those seeking political profits from the miseries of a nation. Hysterical scare-mongering and neurotic hectoring by those who have found themselves outwitted in the power struggle can never be a substitute for a calm, rational evaluation of the dilemma of a nation. You cannot browbeat people who have been in this thing long before you. When the cloud of delusional grandstanding clears, the problem will still remain. It was in the process of deciding what to write about this week that yours sincerely stumbled on this piece which contains some unusual reflections about the state of the country which are still very relevant and crucial today sixteen years after. Titled Remapping the Nation: National Boundaries and Normative Bounds, this is the maiden Democracy Lecture of the Centre for Constitutionalism and Demilitarization delivered by yours sincerely on December 23, 2003 at the Airport Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos. We have decided to publish the lecture and its recommendations because of the relevance to the soul searching about the future of Nigeria.
