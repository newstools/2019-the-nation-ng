New officials have been elected and sworn in to run the affairs of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Adamawa State. The offices of chairman and secretary were keenly contested for in the NUJ election which took place at the Press Centre in Yola on Saturday, while the other offices were taken by aspirants who had no opposition. Ishaka Donald Dedan of the state-run radio house, Adamawa Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), was elected chairman. Dedan got 68 votes to defeat Kate Aliyuda of Adamawa Television (ATV) who got 47 votes, and Umar Dan Kano of the Correspondents’ Chapel who polled 33 votes. Fidelis Jockthan of Fombina FM was elected secretary of the NUJ with 85 votes, defeating his sole challenger, Emanuel Njiaprim of the Correspondents’ Chapel who got 61 votes. Abdullahi Ibrahim of the ATV became the vice chairman unopposed, while Isa Tukur of ABC was elected assistant secretary, similarly unopposed. Mary Adamu of NTA became the financial secretary while Felicia Amos Dauda of Adamawa Publishing Ltd was elected treasurer. Delivering his acceptance speech, the chairman, Ishaka Dedan, appealed to the two people who contested for the position with him not to take his election as a defeat for them but to support him for the progress of the NUJ. “Power comes from the mighty God and He gives whom he wishes. I know how the NUJ members yearn for development. I can assure you that the new exco shall hit the ground running,” Dedan said.
