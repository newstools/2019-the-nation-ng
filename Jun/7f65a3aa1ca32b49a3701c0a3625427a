President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the family, friends, and loved ones of Professor Richard Olayiwola Fagbenle, who passed on this week, aged 76. The Professor of Mechanical Engineering was also an energy expert, who made Nigeria proud in many countries of the world, and got hired by the United Nations in the 1990s as Director of Energy for Botswana, as well as serving on the Energy Board for Southern Africa for about four years. President Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the deceased exemplified some of the very best Nigeria can offer, and wished his soul eternal rest, noting that his footprints would remain indelible in the sands of time. The late academic and first-class scholar pioneered three higher institutions as Director, Provost, and Governing Council Chairman, respectively. The President urged academics to strive to approximate Prof Fagbenleâ€™s giant strides, and use their God-given intellect for the benefit of the country, and humanity at large. He prayed God to comfort all those who mourn the departed and take solace in the fact that he lived a worthy life, and left enduring legacies behind.
