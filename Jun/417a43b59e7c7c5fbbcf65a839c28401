Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s declaration at the USA Fair 2019 that Nigeria needs $140 billion external loans to tackle infrastructural decay over the next four years to improve the ease of doing business towards creating more jobs was jolting! This is because the debt tool has become a sensitive economic differentiator between various countries in its treatment as an economic vitamin or a toxin based on stages of development, world view, vision/mission, resource endowment, financial discipline/integrity and debt tactics within their macro-economic management. Nigeria’s case in debt need and use has remained controversial between borrowing for consumption and investment for long-term growth which always mirrored the capacity, competence and patriotism of those entrusted with the economy’s management. Thus the statistics and history of Nigeria’s external debts have been confounding, starting with $1 billion in 1977 and $1. 456 billion in 1978 that ballooned with economy-hemorrhaging debt-servicing ratios from less than 1% in 1977 to 8.9% in 1982 and 30.5% in 1983 that continually influenced the pendulous swings of the economy and socio-political stability. By 2004, external debt was $35.945 billion and domestic debt was $10.3 billion, totaling $46.2 billion or 64.3% of GDP excluding contractor and pension arrears. After obtaining the $18 billion debt relief by paying $12.4 billion to creditors, external debt was reduced to $3.544 billion while domestic debt increased to $13.8 billion, totaling $17.344 billion with a debt/GDP ratio of 11.8% in August 2006. In August 2011, external debt increased marginally to $5.67 billion while domestic debt soared to $42.23 billion, totaling $47.9 billion. But on June 30, 2015, external debt increased to $10.317 billion and domestic debt galloped to $53.489 billion (FG, $42.633, States, $10.856) totaling $63.806 billion i.e. total debt increased by $46.462 billion ($6.773 billion external, $39.689 billion domestic) or 268% between August 2006 and June 2015! This was significant because while Nigeria obtained debt relief when it became unserviceable at $46.2 billion after 29 years with crude oil sales of $48.1 billion annual average during 1999 to 2009, she increased her debt by $46.462 billion to $63.806 billion in only the following nine years! And domestic debt rose “sharpest” by $39.689 billion (85% of the increase!) between 2010 and 2014 when $76.2 billion annual average was earned from crude oil with enough resources to clear arrears and avoid new debts. Comparative data between June 2015 and December 2018 (latest DMO data) showed that total debts increased by only 24.5% from $63.806 billion to $79. 437 billion despite 47% decline in crude oil revenue to $40.24 billion annual average between 2015 and 2018. This comprised additional $14.957 billion that increased external debt by 14.5% to $25.274 billion from $10.317 billion while domestic debt increased by 1.3% with $672.72 million from $53.489 billion to $54.162 billion through strategy change: external loans for capital projects and shift to external than domestic loans to reduce interest charges and pressure on the private sector, albeit with exchange rate fluctuation risks along with the new fiscal strategy of more local production than importation for consumption needs and gradual reversal of the trade-over-investment conundrum. Hence, whereas total domestic debt increased by only 1.3% from $53.490 to $54.162 billion, federal government’s share reduced by 2.4% from $42.633 to $41.610 billion while the states/FCT share increased by 24.5% from $10.856 billion to $12.552 billion. But it is surprising that despite the rigorous template to check debt increase in the states/FCT in compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Act and $5.4 billion Paris Club refunds, their debts still increased by $1.695 billion or 24.5%. Overall, domestic borrowing could have been reduced if duplicated functions in MDAs were merged. Also the11,886 “constituency projects” on which N7.78 trillion was wasted is a lingering issue in public revenue mismanagement. Moreover, AMCON seems to have hit the rocks on recovering the N5 trillion debts. Thus, with these cumulonimbus clouds of debt hanging on the public and private sectors, by how much faster can Nigeria walk/work again with her debt-manacled feet or faster economic growth be achieved without pressing dangerous fiscal-measure buttons like reckless public asset sale or sporadic tax/tariff increases? This intervention is necessitated by the economic-gloom merchants who ignore the fact that, weakened with the highest debt level in history, Nigerians were living above their means with artificial growth rate by borrowing for consumption pre-June 2015 despite the relatively abundant resources. The recession-led reset to its realistic level, without consumption loan-props, has armed cynics with the Nigeria-is-the-poverty-capital-of-the-world stigma. Thus some quick-fix “experts” started dictating panic 2020 budget fiscal measures to escalate socio-economic tension perhaps unwittingly ahead of the 2020 budget preparation. It is crucial that the Budget Office thinks outside the box by not complicating the economic problems with fiscal measures without their holistic implications for the economy’s fragile status by simplistically exploiting the global statistics of tax revenue to GDP ratio of Nigeria’s 6.1% compared to Egypt’s 15.8%, Kenya’s 18.4%, Ghana’s 20.8% and South Africa’s 26.9% for sporadic tax/tariff increases. This will ignore the fact that the tax/tariff level in each country reflects its economic structure (formal/informal), level of infrastructural development and the need to match the measures with her economic status e.g. a post-recession convalescence. Although it is not yet clear if the estimated $140 billion external loans required in the next four years are included in the available global forecast up to 2024, the current estimate of “future gross government debt as % GDP” of 35.885% in 2024 for Nigeria is very handsome compared to Ghana’s 50.204%, South Africa’s 66.465% and Egypt’s 72.758%. But Nigeria’s economic incubus appears to be the inherited $63.806 billion debt which has been unsettling the economic system by increasing the debt/revenue service ratio above 65% along with its several whammies of depriving the nation financial resources for maintaining critical services in many sectors, compelling more domestic borrowing to maintain those services and increasing loans for infrastructural development as it is difficult to trace the assets acquired with the increased $46.462 billion debt and/or their contributions to the GDP since even the privatization proceeds were expended rather than re-invested for infrastructural upgrade/development. Hence, a reflexive increase of revenues through taxes and tariffs to reduce domestic borrowing for financing the budget deficit may nominally increase growth but will shrink the post-recession economic base further in real terms due to the inverse relationship between price increase and volume growth. This can undermine the critically needed expansion being marshaled with the diversification into the non-oil sector, scare more potential FDIs and prevent the early conversion of the existing $90 billion FDI MOUs into growth-engineering investments or even trigger their emigration. These are very serious risks! Also, the hyper-tight impact of the TSA and import/export duties collection at the ports and borders on liquidity and pricing along with other monetary measures indicate the risks of increasing taxes and tariffs triggered by the servicing costs on $63.806 billion debt incubus. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that if Nigeria did not secure the debt relief that reduced the $35.945 billion external debt to $3.544 billion, it could have ballooned to $100 billion by now with the cyclically re-emerged scenarios of bearish crude oil pricing forecasts regardless of the quantum of increases in taxes and tariffs that would also have triggered an economic collapse. Similarly, unless the pre-June 2015  $63.806 billion debt is addressed possibly through debt restructuring (since 84% of it is domestic) as a lower risk to increases in taxes and tariffs, the growing socio-economic groaning from the stress of this economic incubus will be worsened. This can be done in tandem with further tightening domestic borrowing by states/FCT, recovery of AMCON debts, merger of duplicated functions in MDAs and abolition of “constituency projects”. Therefore, it is necessary to give the inherited $63.806 billion debt in June 2015 or 80.32% of total debt in December 2018 the urgent holistic treatment it obliges to reduce the growing level of socio-economic tension. This is because more loans for infrastructural development are needed to support the diversification of the economy into the non-oil sector since Nigeria has no alternative, given the long-term global uncertainty in the oil sector.
