The Panel 2 Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Asaba has granted a motion by Mr. Harrison Akpojaro candidate of All Progressive Congress (APC) Okpe constituency in the 2019 General Election, Delta State House of Assembly. The petitioner contested against Mr. Sherriff Oborevwori, (PDP), (1st Respondent) current member and speaker in the Delta State House of Assembly. Charles Umweni, lead counsel to the petitioner had moved a motion urging the tribunal to allow the petitioner effect minor amendment to his petition. He urged the Tribunal to grant his motion to make a minor amendment to his petition which he claimed was a clerical error. He maintained that by provisions of 14(2)(a) and (b) of the 1st schedule of the ElectoralÂ  Act 2010 as amended, the provisions of the Electoral Act do not forbid amendment in so far such amendment are not substantial. He urged the tribunal to grant his motion to delete the word Warri North, and replace it with Okpe saying it is a clerical error that the Act does not forbid. The petitioner through his council submitted that minor amendments cannot in anyway charge the substance of the petition and urged the tribunal to grant the motion for minor amendment. Counsel to the speaker, Hon. Sherriff Oborevwori, (PDP), (1st Respondent), Ekeme Owhovioriole (SAN), urged the tribunal to refuse the motion for minor amendment to the petition as prayed by the petitioner, saying if such is granted it will amount to entire petition being amended. The tribunal chair, Hon. Justice C.O. Onyeabo agreed with the submissions of counsels to the petitioner, granted the motion for minor amendment to the petition.
