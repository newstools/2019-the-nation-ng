The National Executive Council of the Petroleum Tanker Drivers Union has suspended its Benin Unit Chairman, Comrade Osamuyi Osahon, for not following the unionâ€™s rules and regulations to resolve conflicts. It said the suspended chairman wrote a petition to the Directorate of State Security instead of using the internal machinery of the Union. A letter signed by Secretary of PTD, Comrade Sunday Ochibejivwe, said the suspended chairman refused to attend sittings of committee set up to look into his grievances. Comrade Ochibejivwe said the committee submitted its report after it realized that the suspended chairman has no regard for the union. He said the indefinite suspension was to commence immediately.
