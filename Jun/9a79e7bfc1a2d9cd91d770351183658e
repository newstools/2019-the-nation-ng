Brand Manager of Life Continental Lager Beer, Chidi Egwu, stated this weekend in Onitsha, Anambra State at the launch of the third edition of “Highlife Fest.” He said the brand had identified music as one of the avenues to promote culture, especially in the southeast part of the country. He said, “Our aim is to showcase highlife music talents to the wider public so that they can develop their talents and become highlife music icons like Osita Osadebe. “What we want is to continue to promote our culture; Life beer is a beer that takes pride in promoting and developing the culture of the South Easterners.” According to Egwu, the two highlife kings who emerged in 2017 and 2018 performed on the same stage with super stars like Phyno and Flavour, who are brand ambassadors of Life beer. He hinted that auditions for the 2019 edition would hold in Enugu, Asaba, Awka and Aba at a date to be announced later by the company. “Everybody in the zone who has highlife talent can partake in the one month audition,” he added. Also speaking, highlife music legend, Bright Chimezie, who is the chief judge for the award, said the festival was an avenue to fish out young talents and nurture them to limelight.
