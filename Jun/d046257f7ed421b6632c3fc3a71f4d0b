Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State Wednesday swore in the re-appointed Secretary to the State Government, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa and seven Permanent Secretaries in the State’s Civil Service, with a warning to Civil Servants to shun partisanship in the discharge of their service to the people. He said the reappointment of the SSG and 6 out of the 7 permanent secretaries was a demonstration of the confidence the government has on their past performances alluding further that it is wrong to change a winning team during a competition He maintained that the second term of his administration is focused on delivering quality dividends of democracy to the people without any form of discrimination, hence he won’t tolerate people being discriminated against or denied service simply because they were from a different party leaning or do not belong to the ruling APC He said, “the People of Katsina state comes first and no any form of discrimination because of party affiliation. My Government will certainly frown at civil servants who promotes partisanship by saying we are the party that brought you hers or that the Governor is from our party and we installed him, so you must do our biddings’’ He also chided politicians who often flaunt party membership or prominence before civil servants believing that through that way they can win contracts saying the government is now operating at the next level and will not hesitate to dismiss civil servants that encourage politicians especially in the award of contracts and during service delivery. Masari further described Katsina people as hardworking and full of integrity and who when given the right opportunity and enabling environment can prove their worth and can take the state to the highest level. He said ’’today we have produced two elected Presidents and a military head of state, showing a people of integrity with capacity to lead others’’ The seven Permanent Secretaries who were sworn in include: Hafiz Iliyasu Wali, Sani Isiaku Masari, Haji Halima Othman, Muktari Lawal, Muktari Danladi, Suleinman Safana
