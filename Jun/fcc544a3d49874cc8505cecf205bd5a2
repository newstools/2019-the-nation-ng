The Iresi of Osi in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Oba David Olajide, on Tuesday escaped abduction by suspected herdsmen on Akure-Owo highway, near Akure Airport, en route his community. Osi community is less than two kilometres to Akure Airport and the same tactics used to abduct a mother and her stepson on Sunday evening by suspected kidnappers were used. Also, the police command Tuesday arrested a herdsman for allegedly membership of a team of abductors that attempted to kidnap the monarch of Osi town. It was learnt that the kidnap attempt failed as Oba Olajide confronted the hoodlums. The monarch said Mrs Olawumi Adeleye, 25 and Destiny Paul, 14, were released yesterday and he took them to the police headquarters in Akure. He said on his return to Osi community, the herdsmen attacked to kidnap him but he escaped. Oba Olajide said: “After the release of the woman, I took her and her stepson to the police headquarters to hand them over to the police. On my way back home, the herdsmen blocked the road with their cows, the same way they did when they kidnapped the woman and her stepson on Sunday when they were returning from church. “As I got to the place, I slowed down my car and I saw them coming to attack me, but I managed to escape. They hit and damaged my car, but through the grace of God, I escaped.” Oba Olajide said one of the herdsmen was arrested and handed over to the police. Police spokesman Femi Joseph said the suspect was in the police custody for investigation. He added: “We have the suspect with us. We are already making efforts to arrest the fleeing members of the gang, and investigation has also commenced.”
