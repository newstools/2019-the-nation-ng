The new Olu of Moloko Ashipa in Obafemi Owode Local Government of Ogun State, Oba Nureni  Adesina and the chiefs have condemned the alleged attempt by Alabi Oguntoyinbo to cause disaffection in the peaceful and agrarian town in connivance with some disgruntled elements. Oba Adesina, until his elevation by the past administration in Ogun State on the strength of  the recommendation by the Alake and Paramount ruler  of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, was the Baale of Moloko Ashipa for 10 years. He disclosed that since being made a coronet Oba, Alabi (allegedly) has been creating confusion in the community, claiming to be member and head (Olori – Ebi) of the ruling family. Alabi Oguntoyinbo and 15 others reportedly  petitioned Governor Dapo Abiodun, claiming membership of the Adesina Likoyi family of Moloko Ashipa and that Oba Nureni Nosiru Adesina wasn’t their choice. But speaking with the The Nation on the development,  Adesina denied Alabi Oguntoyinbo, saying Pa (Chief) Osho Oguntola Adesina is the head (Olori – ebi) of his family and urged whoever that is in doubt, should go verify from Pa Osho who, he added, is still alive in the town. “We condemn this attempt to create confusion by some disgruntled elements. I have been Baale since 2010 and later made Baale – General. I have been functioning in that capacity and nobody contested the office with me. “Alabi Oguntoyinbo is not the head (Olori – ebi) of my family. Our Olori – ebi is Pa Osho Oguntola Adesina and he is alive. ”Alabi Oguntoyinbo has been out of the town for about 25 years and has lost touch with reality in the town. I advise people to discountenance and disregard the posturing of Alabi Oguntoyinbo,” he said. Checks by The Nation revealed that Adesina enjoys the support of the Alake, the Balogun of Igbore Chief Tajudeen Lemboye; the Oluwo of Igbore Chief Anthony Oliyide; the women leader (Mama Isedo) Madam Fauisat Adesina and elders of Moloko Ashipa.
