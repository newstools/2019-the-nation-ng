The All Progress Congress (APC ) in Zamfara state will play credible opposition to the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. This was revealed by the immediate past governor of the state Dr. Abdul Aziz Abubakar Yari in his Sallah Message to the people of the state at his residence in Mafara on Thursday The APC now as opposition political party will offer constructive criticism that’ll will assist the present PDP government in delivering dividends of democracy to the people of the state. “Ours is not going to be the type that only criticised against even the best of decision by government, Zamfara politics is one family even though we have our resolves and unresolved differences.” The APC remains the party to beat at all times in Zamfara state explaining that that journey to APC started from the inception of the All People’s Party, APP to All Nigerian People’s Party ANPP and now the All Progressive People’s Party APC. On if he’ll decamp to another political party aside from the APC, Yari said that he’ll never leave the party even if its name is to be changed. Yari who urged all citizens to support the new administration in the state in order to enjoy positive development further said ” the reason for your support to the governor based on my experience as governor is, if you trouble the governor, it’ll be difficult for him to deliver meaningful development, if he is not happy then you’ll not be happy.” Yari said he is fulfilled because he has paved way for the new government for easy continuance with positive development of the state. Yari stressed that he achieved so much in physical infrastructural development in the state revealing that he has never awarded any project throughout his tenure until he has deposited at least 60% of the total cost of the contract.
