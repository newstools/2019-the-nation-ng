There was jubilation on Monday at the Lagos State Secretariat in Alausa, Ikeja,  following the unveiling of 35 new air-conditioned  buses provided for workers by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Sanwo-Olu, on resumption of duty last Thursday, promised to provide workers the buses as part of incentives to  improve their welfare. Handing over the buses to the workers at the CSB Park, Alausa Secretariat, the Head of Service (HoS), Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola,  said the gesture portrayed Sanwo-Olu as ‘’a merciful leader who takes delight in workers’ welfare’’. Muri-Okunola urged the workers to show their appreciation through hard work and dedication to duty. He said: ‘’To whom much is given, much is expected. The only way we can reciprocate this kind gesture is to intensify our efforts by being more hard working and ensure due diligence to our duty.” According to the HoS, one of the requirements brought before the governor during electioneering was the need to re-fleet the moribund staff buses in order to ensure workers’ commitment to duty. The governor’s response   then, he recalled, was that he would consider the request, if elected. Muri-Okunola said to his surprise, the governor entered one of the staff buses to address workers on his first day at work but could not due to the state of the vehicle. “Let us thank His Excellency for fulfilling his promise by re-fleeting our buses even with all the state-of-the-art facilities including air-condition. What I would advise is that you should take ownership of the buses and improve on your performance and be more dedicated to your duty,” he said. Responding, Chief Driver Abiodun Olusesi thanked the governor for  his gesture, adding that the workers would take ownership of the buses.
