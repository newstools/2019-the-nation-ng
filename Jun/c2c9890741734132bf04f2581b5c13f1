Liverpool has won the 2018/2019 Champions League after Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi earned the Reds a 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspurs in Saturday night’s Madrid final. Having been beaten 3-1 by Real Madrid in last season’s final in Kiev, Liverpool were out to exorcise those demons with Jurgen Klopp also seeking his first trophy since becoming the club’s head coach back in 2015. Given the dramatic nature of this season’s Champions League campaign, it was no surprise to see the final kick off in chaotic fashion as Liverpool were awarded a penalty inside the first 30 seconds of the match. Referee Damir Skomina pointed to the spot after Moussa Sissoko was adjudged to have handled Sadio Mane’s cross, and Salah stepped up to fire the penalty over Hugo Lloris and into the net after just 118 seconds. It was fitting that Salah struck, given that he limped out of last year’s final in tears after being injured following a clash with Sergio Ramos – an injury which also Spurs pressed for a route back into a game which was typified by slack possession and mistakes from both sides, but Liverpool made it two late on as Divock Origi – the Reds’ hero of the semi-final second leg with two goals against Barcelona – struck a clinical finish in the 87th minute. The win ensured Liverpool lifted their sixth European Cup, adding to previous successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, and 2005.  standard.co.uk
