The Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC) superintends the National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP). It has, over the years, been intervening in the power sector value chain. EMEKA UGWUANYI examines its scorecard in power generation, transmission and distribution. The three tiers of government, in an effort to overcome challenges in the energy sector, and ensure socio-economic development, set up the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC). Formed in 2005, as the vehicle to implement the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP), the NDPHC was designed for the 10 gas-fired power stations in the gas-producing states of the Niger Delta. Also, the NDPHC embarked on  gas infrastructural projects to  provide adequate gas to fire the power plants. The NDPHC and the National Integrated Power Projects have become success stories even more than envisaged by stakeholders. The NIPP has become a pillar to Nigeria’s power sector stability. Intervention in gas supply and transmission The ND PHC has successfully intervened in the shortage of gas supply to the NIPP power stations in the Western Delta – Ogorode, Benin (Ihovbor), Omotosho and Olorunsogo. This has led to improved gas supply to these power stations. On the inadequate transmission capacity to evacuate power from the Eastern Delta plants, there was the quick completion of the 12 circuit 330KV Ikot-Ekpene-switching station and the dual circuit 330kV transmission lines from the Alaoji and Calabar power stations. There was also the completion of the first circuit (line 2) of the Ikot-Ekpene to Ugwuaji four circuits 330KV. On the inadequate gas pipeline infrastructure in the Eastern Delta (Alaoji and Calabar), there was the completion of the Northern Option Pipeline project (NOPL) by Total for gas supply to Alaoji Power Station and the completion of the Seven Energy dedicated pipeline from Uquo field to Calabar Power Station. Magboro and its environs in Ogun State, after 17 years of non-supply, was in 2017 delivered electric power through the intervention of the NDPHC. Having completed the Magboro connection project, electricity was supplied to Ugwuaji, Egbema, Okija, Omotosho and Olorunsogo communities. Such has been the magnitude and the trend of the positive activities, including hundreds of distribution projects in various zones, working to optimise the about 3,000 megawatts (Mw) in the NIPP Plants to get to end users. Renewed commitment NDPHC Managing Director Mr. Chiedu Ugbo, said: “We are staying close to the projects and the contractors to know what their problems are. We don’t just sit back in our offices because we are not engaged to do that. “The NDPHC has embarked on the construction of additional 120 transmission stations and sub-stations and 10 critical power generation projects that will be transferred to the national grid. This will, ultimately, support power generation and supply in the country. It has been involved in the construction of distribution lines to increase distribution of electricity to even rural communities. “The NDPHC, when it sees the need, intervenes in critical areas to ensure stable electric supply. For instance, it recently completed a distribution line for Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (DisCo) to consolidate the supply of electricity to communities in its franchise area. It provided a 33kv line and every community along that line will tap into it. It is doing unique intervention jobs like this because it believes Nigerians must have public power supply.” Completed distribution substations Some recently completed distribution substations and lines include 1x15MVA, 33/11kV Injection Substation in Tambuwal, Sokoto State; 1x15MVA, 33/11kV, 1X7.5MVA injection substation in Fegge, Anambra State; 1X7.5MVA, 33/11kV injection substationin Potiskum, Yobe State; 1X15MVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Gagi, Sokoto State; 1×7.5MVA, 33/11kV injection substation in Otta, Ogun State; 1X15MVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Angwan Dosa, Kaduna State; 2×7.5 MVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Lamingo, Plateau State; 2X15MVA, 33/11KV injection substation, Zaria Road, Jos; construction of 33kV line from Oke Aro Transmission Station to Mowe SubStation; 2x15MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Asaba, Delta State; 1×7.5 MVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Saminaka, Kaduna State; 1X7.5kVMVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Iloko, Osun State; 1X15MVA, 33/11kV injection substation, Aminkanle, Lagos State;  1x15MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Abule Taylor, Lagos State; 1x15MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Elemoro, Lagos State; 1×7.5MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Bauchi, Bauchi State; 1x15MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Farfaru, Sokoto State; 1×7.5MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Water Works Gusua, Zamfara State; 1×7.5MVA, 33/11kv injection substation, Otowhodo, Delta State and 1×7.5MVA, and 33/11kv injection substations in Ibusa, Delta State. Also recent intervention projects in distribution include 78 projects, over 544Km of 33kV Lines, over 130km of 11kV Lines, 199 distribution transformers including 100KVA, 200KVA, 300KVA, 500 KVA; 148MVA Injection Substation Capacity and 108MVA Distribution Transformers Capacity. The Ikot Abasi 330/132kv, 3x150MVA substation has been completed. The transmission substation, the largest of the NDPHC projects, is being designed as a power evacuation facility for power generated by the Ibom Power station, Alscon Power station as well as the Qua Iboe power plant of ExxonMobil in Eket. In 2016, NDPHC constructed a 330/132kv switching station in Ikot Epkene, Akwa Ibom State. It also constructed six injection distribution substations of various capacities in Akwa Ibom State along with completely Self-Protected transformers (CSP). Completed power stations, others The NDPHC has also completed a couple of projects in the generation. These include the 750 megawatts (Mw) Olorunsogo 11; 450Mw Sapele; 434Mw Geregu 11; 450Mw Omotosho 11; 450Mw Ihovbor; 450MW Alaoji;  563Mw Calabar and 225Mw Gbarain power stations. According to the data on its website, NDPHC has completed 2,194km of 330KV transmission lines and 809km of 132KV transmission lines; an increase of 46 per cent and 13 per cent over the pre-NIPP status of grid infrastructure. It has further constructed a total of 2,600km of 11kv and 1,700km of 33kv distribution lines for improving access to electricity. It is trite that there is heavy dependence on the NIPP plants in bringing electricity supply to Nigerians. In grid instability, NIPP plants provide about 265Mw of spinning reserves to facilitate grid responsiveness during disturbances on the transmission network. Spinning reserve is practised all over the world. The NDPHC assets are the backbone of Nigeria’s power infrastructure. Therefore, a transparent privatisation for credible international firms will push the NIPP across the finishing line. Nigeria’s installed capacity (nationwide) in generation projects pre-NIPP was 5, 329Mw, but by 2006, it had risen 8,440Mw and post-NIPP it is 13,140Mw, an increase of 56 per cent. In transmission projects, Nigeria’s 330kV lines pre-NIPP was 4,495km but by 2006, it increased to 4,738km, and post-NIPP is 6,932km, an increase of 46 per cent. Nigeria’s 132kV lines pre-NIPP was 5,430km but by 2006, it went up to 6,227km, and post-NIPP it is 7,036km, an increase of 13 per cent. Nigeria’s 132/33kV transformer capacity pre-NIPP was 5,700MVA and by 2006, it was 7,805MVA, and post-NIPP is 11,118MVA, an increase of             42 per cent. Nigeria’s 330/132kV transformer capacity pre-NIPP was 5,300MVA, which went up to 6,008MVA by 2006, and post-NIPP, it is 11,590MVA, an increase of 93 per cent. In national distribution projects, 33kV transmission lines at 2006 was 45,252km, post-NIPP is 47,538km, an increase of five per cent; 11kV transmission lines as at 2006 was 31,973km but post-NIPP, it is 36,648km, an increase of 15 per cent. 0.415kV transmission lines as at 2006 was 232,862km, post-NIPP it is 245,905km, an increase of six per cent and 33/11kV substations at 2006 was 8,148MVA, post-NIPP it is 11,649MVA, an increase of 43 per cent. 33kV & 11/0.415kV substations as at 2006, was 11,810MVA, and post NIPP it is 14,878MVA reflecting an increase of 26 per cent; 33kV & 11/0.415kV substations as at 2006 was 32,000, post-NIPP is 84,170, an increase of 163 per cent. Also, 33kV/11kV substations as at 2006 were 1,048, but post-NIPP it is 1,311, an increase of 25 per cent. Need to commence second phase of NIPP In the second phase of NIPP, the NDPHC will build hydro power plants in the North and complete transmission projects carried over from first phase. It will also launch into power generation from alternative renewable sources. According to the company, millions of Nigerians daily enjoy power supply, but are not aware of the tremendous efforts put in by various governmental bodies. Though the national energy demand is huge and 100 per cent supply is yet to be met, there are federal agencies working for Nigerians. Some of the improvement in public power supply can be attributed to the NDPHC executing its mandate to add new capacity to public power supply. “It is with all earnestness, that this charge has been religiously carried out. The records are in the public domain. Nigerians have also come to appreciate the challenges the NDPHC faced through the years in its inability to deliver its mandate. Some of those challenges still exist. The vision of the NDPHC was clear, but it needed men to drive its corporate mission, to surmount challenges. In taking over management of the NDPHC, the Ugbo-led team hit the ground running. “To avoid pitfalls, it introduced international best practices, set clear its bearings and tried to avoid needless controversies and distractions. Like a ship sailing in dangerous waters, it took precautions; it avoided tainted men with baggage; avoided the unseen shoals and rocky reefs of quacks and racketeers. The object of any public service corporation management should be the satisfaction of the people.  The NDPHC was charged to give much attention to more concentrated power infrastructural development to delivering Nigerians stable electric power. Armed with this directive, it has worked to be above board and to ensure its focus is not abridged. The success of the NDPHC will inevitably raise the living standard of all Nigerians,” the company said. Ugbo said the success story of the NDPHC has been from the support of the government of Nigeria and its workers who have always been result-oriented and driven with a passion to help the populace. Their job is not a luxury. It comes with a back-breaking schedule of field activities. Nigerians need stable electric supply. This will bring joy to their homes and their choice of economic activities will be boosted as electric supply turns the wheels of most of our lives. This has been the major pre-occupation of the NDPHC, continuing in its march to attain stable electric supply for Nigerians. It is using every available means to aid the generation, transmission and distribution of power supply on the principle of best services. The character of the developments, demonstrate that its policy is dominated by public interest rather than private interest.
