Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has advised an All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, Prof. Seidu Ogah to banish the hope of ever clinching the party’s ticket from his thought. Mohammed has advocated direct primaries to pick the party’s standard bearer for the November 16 election. He boasted to defeat incumbent Governor Bello in a free and fair contest. But a statement by Bello’s spokesman, Onogwu Mohammed, dismissed Oga’s claims as “day-dream by a political neophyte” who will be trounced and humiliated during the party’s primary election billed for August. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to a day-dreamer whose new past time is to make fantastic claims to having some bogus political clout within our great party. But we dare say that there is no issue about who will fly the flag of the APC for the governorship election. Stakeholders within the party are unanimous that Governor Yahaya Bello is the only credible and popular candidate who can give the party victory at the November 16 governorship election. “Prof. Seidu Mohammed and his imaginary supporters should know that members of the APC are politically sophisticated and would ignore the empty grandstanding of a political lightweight who has no record of winning any election in his life, not even a councillorship election.” Mohammed advised Oga to quietly withdraw from the race and proceed to enjoy his life in retirement after his tenure as Director-General of the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA).
