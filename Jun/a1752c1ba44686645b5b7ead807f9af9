The Chairman of Agreement Renegotiation Committee of Nigerian Universities, Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN), at the weekend called for free education to make learning accessible and affordable across the country. He said government should not sacrifice quality for quantity. The former chairman of Association of Pro-Chancellors in Nigeria urged the government to restructure its university and secondary education system. This, according to him, will ensure production of employable graduates, making the country to regain its respect in the comity of nations. Babalakin said this had become imperative because of the current ranking of Nigeriaâ€™s best university as 800th in the world. The eminent lawyer stated this while delivering the seventh convocation lecture of the Kwara State University (KWASU) at Malete in Moro Local Government Area. He said the nation must start its education system all over again. Babalakin, who emphasized the need for state and Federal governments to channel adequate funding into secondary and university education system, said quality products from the secondary school system would ensure good and quality university graduates.
