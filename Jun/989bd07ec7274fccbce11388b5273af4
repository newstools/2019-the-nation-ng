The eight edition of the annual Gtbank Masters Cup hit final stage after the semi finals were played at the Campus Mini Stadium, Lagos. King’s College secured their glory by earning a 4-0 amazing victory over Whitesands School at the competition. Despite the early day’s downpour, King’s College boys didn’t look to take their opponent easy as they thrashed Whitesand boys four goals to book a final match against Anwar Ul Islam Model College, Agege which outshined CMS Grammar School in an amazing 1-0 win, after penalty was awarded to both teams. For the females match, Leadforte College took down Ansar-UD-Deen Girls High School, Itire, in a 2-1 to book a final place with Queen’s College who defeated Atlantic Hall Epe with a walkover. Ansar-ud-Deen Girls were sharper after the break which led to their one goal but Leadforte College got down smartly earning a victory lead. Gtbank, as usual, reiterated the need to give sports especially football the best support they can stating that this will tackle indiscipline and reduce social vices amongst the youths in the society. This includes promoting the development of sports, as the bank retains their sponsorship of the football programme. The tournament was first conceived when GTBank realized that grass-root football development was incomplete without participation of all schools in Lagos state (Private and Public) especially those that dominated the Principals Cup over 3 decades ago, since its inception in 1954.
