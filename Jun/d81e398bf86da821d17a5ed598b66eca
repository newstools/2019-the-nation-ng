THE Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) says it is aiming to double the income of 20 million small farmers in Africa. This, the agricultural body said, would be done by supporting local farmers in boosting rice production and other mandate crops during the 2019 farming season. AGRA’s Country Manager, Dr Kehinde Makinde, stated this during a meeting between his team and the Niger State Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Minna. AGRA, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the Rockefeller Foundation, deals with improving agricultural products and supporting local farm owners and labour in Africa. Makinde, who was represented by the State Associate Programme Officer, Mr Godswill Aguiyi, said AGRA would also work at reducing food insecurity by 50 per cent in 20 countries and ensure that at least 15 countries are on a path toward sustainable and climate-friendly green agriculture. The country manager further said the body would strengthen the capacity of the ministry of agriculture and rural development in order to be able to increase income and improve food security of small holder farmers to enhanced programme delivery. He said the support is through the Partnership Inclusive Agricultural Transformation in Africa (PIATA) component under AGRA. In his address, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Ibrahim Garba Musa, pledged the state government’s commitment to the implementation of the programme.
