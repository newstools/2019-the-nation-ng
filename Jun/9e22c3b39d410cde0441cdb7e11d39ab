An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded two men at Kirikiri Prisons for allegedly defiling a 13-year-old orphan. The prosecutor, Ezekiel Ayorinde, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), told the court that the men – Olabisi Olaniawo, 35, and Busayo Adeshope, 27 – were foster father and step-brother to the victim when they committed the offence at their homes between 2015 and 2019. They are facing a lone count of child defilement before Magistrate Bola Osunsanmi. Ayorinde said Olaniawo took custody of the girl at his Igando home when she was nine years old, following the death of her parents, and started having sex with her. The prosecutor alleged that when the girl relocated to Adeshope’s house at Ikeja, the second defendant, her step-brother, also started having carnal knowledge of her. He said the girl later told a trusted person what the defendants had been doing to her. This led to the reporting of the incident at a police station and the arrest of the suspect. When the charge was read, Magistrate Osunsanmi did not take the plea of the accused. She ordered that they be remanded in prison pending advice from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). The matter was adjourned till July 15 for mention.
