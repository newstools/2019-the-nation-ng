The funeral service in his honour held at St. Andrew’s Anglican Church, Ada, was attended by dignitaries across the country. Among those in attendance were the chairman of Boripe North Local Council Development Area, Ismaila Idowu, the chairman of the MicCom Wire and Cable, Engr.

In his sermon, the Rt. Revd. James Popoola, described the deceased monarch as God-fearing and a man that had passion for the development of his domain, which he ruled for about twenty-four years. He praised the late Oba Abioye for his humility and for providing an exemplary leadership for his people, noting that his reign had brought “rapid development” to Ada. The cleric, who advised Nigerians to emulate the deceased monarch’s style of leadership, also noted that Ada witnessed peace and unity during his reign, adding that his domain cultivated friendship with neighbouring communities and therefore fast tracked development in the area.
