National carrier, Globacom, has urged female students across the country to embrace science subjects in order to fit into careers that are related to Information Communications Technology (ICT) in future. Its Account Manager, Public Sector, Lagos Zone, Mrs. Justina Abdulateef, who spoke at the 2019 International Girls in ICT Day organised by eBusinessLife Magazine, said the ICT space requires a broad range of skills which operators are continually looking for to hire. Abdulateef encouraged female students from 15 prominent schools in Lagos to diligently prepare themselves for studies in mathematics, engineering, computing and other such fields. Though she noted that stereotypes and discrimination had discouraged many girls from pursuing interests in ICT, she stresed the  need to break the stereotypes early in life to propel females towards developing interest in the ICT sector. “Increasingly, more women across the world were proving their mettle in the male-dominated, technical professions. Examples abound  of women who have distinguished themselves in engineering, medicine and other related professions. As girl students, you must therefore, never let anyone limit your possibilities. If you set your mind to it, there is nothing you cannot achieve as a girl.” She said research  had shown that there was a nexus between ICT and economic growth of a country, culminating in enhanced emphasis  on ICT by policy-makers  with a view to ensuring that the sector flourishes in future.
