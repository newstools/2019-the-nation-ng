Did the Police raid the Abuja residence of Taraba State Governor Darius Dickson on June 11 as alleged by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum. Was the raid alleged to have been conducted with a warrant from the Presidency’s Special Investigation Panel legal? These are questions on the minds of Nigerians following a statement by Bayelsa State Governor and Chairman of the forum Seriake Dickson on Thursday night. The statement which was signed on behalf of Dickson by his media aide Fidelis Soriwei alleged that a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) led the raid to the Governor’s residence to conduct a search. But police spokesman Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner (DCP) told our reporter he was not aware of the incident. Mba said: “I do not have any information on that. I am not aware of such operation.  I will however check and get back to you.” According to the statement by Dickson, the alleged invasion was illegal and should be investigated by the Inspector General of Police (IG) Mohammed Adamu in order to identify the culprits for necessary action. The Governor appealed to the national security establishment to adopt appropriate measures to protect Governor Ishaku, members of his family and officials. “We hereby condemn the invasion and forcible entry into the Abuja residence of Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku by people who claim to be police operatives. “We condemn the illegal action and call on the police authorities to investigate this disturbing incident with a view to bringing the suspect to book. “We also call on the national security establishment to take the requisite step to protect Gov Ishaku, members of his family and officials,” Dickson said.
