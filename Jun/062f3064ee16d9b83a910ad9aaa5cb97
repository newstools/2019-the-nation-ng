Media practitioners in Niger State have called on the state government to re-introduce and enforce the monthly environmental sanitation programme across the state. The Niger State government has stopped the monthly environmental programme for more than five years. The re-introduction of the sanitation programme, according to the journalists, would increase effective sanitation and hygiene practices in the state. This was part of the resolutions taken by the journalists at the end of a three-day media roundtable meeting on enhancing participation of media organisations in urban WASH issues organised by the Niger State Water Board and USAID Effective Water Sanitation and Hygiene Services (E-WASH) in Minna. The state government was urged to mandate private business owners, especially restaurants, shopping malls, filling stations to build places of convenience as part of their corporate social responsibility. The need for the state government to build conveniences in strategic public places as part of the bid in discouraging open defecation was also emphasised. The media was charged to expand coverage of WASH activities and partner with the state water board in the introduction of Water Sanitation And Hygiene (WASH) clubs in schools to encourage hand-washing, building places of convenience.
