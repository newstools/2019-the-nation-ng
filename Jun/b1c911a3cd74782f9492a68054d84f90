Edo State chapter of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has berated Governor Godwin Obaseki over the delay in sending the official proclamation letter for inauguration of the 7th House of Assembly. A statement by the State chairman of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, outlined that the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria made a very clear position on the three arms of government with subject to their roles and responsibilities. He condemned the assault on the state’s democracy by calling on all lovers of Democracy to call the governor to order. He said: “What is playing out today in Edo State is that the executive arm led by Governor Godwin Obaseki has clearly and illegally stopped the legislature from performing it’s constitutional role by refusing to send the official proclamation letter to Clerk of the House for the inauguration of the 7th Assembly”. “By his unconstitutional act, he has assumed the character of a sole administrator. Edo PDP is uncomfortable with this unfortunate development. “We knew the inherent dangers of the APC magical claim of 24 over 24. As a party we want it on record that this unpleasant development has nothing to do with Edo PDP but a product of greed and inordinate ambition of a non performing government who is afraid of its shadows”. The chairman further urged the Governor to do the needful and transmit the letter of proclamation to the clerk without further delay. He said the 7th Assembly ought to have been inaugurated on Monday, June 10. Procedurally, the state governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, ought to have made a proclamation for the dissolution of the 6th Assembly, to pave the way for the inauguration of the 7th Assembly. But the governor had yet to transmit the proclamation to the Assembly Clerk. However, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said Obaseki will proclaim the Assembly as soon as he is back from Abuja.
