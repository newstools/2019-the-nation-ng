ONE hundred youths from the five area councils of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have received special training on film and video production. Facilitated by the Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC), the five-day training programme had youth empowerment and the creation of employment as its focus. The participants received training in Scripting and Acting, Digital Cinematography, Directing, Production Management, Digital Editing for Film & Television, and Digital Still Photography. In his remarks, Senator Philip Aduda Tanimu, initiator of the training of the youths and Senator representing the Federal Capital Territory, charged participants to utilise the knowledge acquired to facilitate economic activities capable of reducing unemployment in the country. Tanimu assured the participants that government was desirous of reducing unemployment in Nigeria to the barest minimum. Also speaking at the closing ceremony, the NFC’s Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dr. Chidia Maduekwe, who was represented by NFC’s Director of Finance & Accounts, Alhaji Sanusi Sambo, said the training programme was aimed at assisting government in engaging youths of the country through empowerment programmes. He said  the prevalence of societal vices can be addressed frontally if, among others, the teaming youths of the country are positively engaged in economic activities. He further said that NFC has developed a robust partnership and collaboration template for training and capacity building of youths by public and private agencies. The 100 youths were issued certificates in recognition of their participation last Saturday.
