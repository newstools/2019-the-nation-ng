THE Federal Government has urged stakeholders in solid mineral exports to improve on their technical skills and production efficiency so as to compete favourably with their peers in the international markets. It also said its economic diversification policy will be meaningless if its solid minerals performed poorly in the international markets The Executive Director/Chief Executive, Nigerian Exports Promotion Council (NEPC), Mr. Olusegun Awolowo who spoke on Wednesday at a one-day capacity building workshop for stakeholders in the solid mineral exports in Jos, Plateau State, said the soild mineral sector is pivotal to the government’s agenda. Represented by  a Deputy Director, National Export Office, Mr. Saave Nanakaan, said: “The Council is aware of the low acceptance of some of Nigerians solid minerals in the international market and other associated problems largely attributable to inefficiency in the production, which is predominantly undertaken by unorganised, unlicensed and unskilled individuals who operates far away from global best practices in the sector.”
