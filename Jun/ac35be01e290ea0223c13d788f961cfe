In a birthday message by its convener, Seyi Bamigbade, the group said the elder statesman made unquantifiable proven leadership contributions to Lagos’s political development. “Words will fail us if we continue to speak of Ex Gov Akinwunmi Ambode`s achievements, integrity and amazing intentions for Lagosians and the black race. “He is worthy of emulation as a political leader and administrator. “I pray that God in His infinite mercy will continue to grant the iconic leader long life in good health”.
