The police on Friday arraigned a 30-year-old woman, Ndigwe Adaorah, in a Life Camp Magistrates’ Court Abuja for allegedly assaulting her neighbour, during an argument over loud music. Adaorah, who resides at House 4 Plot 6, Goodness Avenue Pollo Estate Kubwa, Abuja, is charged with two counts of criminal trespass voluntarily causing grievous hurt with provocation and destruction of documents to prevent production of evidence. The Prosecution Counsel, Mr Fedelis Ogbodo, told the court that Ms Madge Jime, of Plot 6 Goodness Avenue Pollo Estate Abuja reported the matter at the FCT Command on Feb. 27. Ogbodo alleged that the defendant, who claimed that the complainant was playing her car stereo too loud, trespassed into her car and switched off the engine. He alleged that when the complainant tried to collect the car key from the defendant, she deliberately refused. ”The defendant then, got into her own car and sped off, in the process she inflicted grievous injuries on the complainant. ”The complainant fractured her leg and also had a tooth removed,” Ogbodo alleged. Ogbode said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 247, 348 and 166 of the Penal Code. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. Ubong Udosen, counsel to the defendant, made an oral application for bail, citing sections 35 (4) and 36 (5) of the 1999 constitution. Udosen also cited sections 58, 162 and 165 (2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act. The Judge, Celestine Odo, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of  N300,000 with one surety who must be a civil servant. Odo ordered that the surety reside within the jurisdiction of the court. The judge adjourned the case until July 22 for trial.
