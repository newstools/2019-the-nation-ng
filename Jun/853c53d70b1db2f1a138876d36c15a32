The Federal Government will, on Monday, inaugurate the board of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to be chaired by Mr. Olufemi Lijadu. The board’s constitution is coming four years after President Muhammadu Buhari sacked the former SEC board headed by Mr. Peter Obi. The inauguration, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) will take place at the Ministry of Finance Headquarters, Abuja. Other  members of the  board  include Mr. Lamido Yuguda from Gombe State (Non-executive Commissioner); Mrs. Rekiya Ladi (Kaduna), Non-executive Commissioner; and Mr. Okokon Ekanem, representing the Ministry of Finance. The rest are: Dr Alvan Ikoku, representing the Central Bank of Nigeria; Ms Mary Uduk, SEC’s Acting Director-General; and Mr. Henry Rowlands, SEC’s Acting Executive Commissioner, Corporate Services; Mr Isyaku Tilde, Acting Executive Commissioner (Operations); and Mr. Reginald Karawusa, SEC’s Acting Executive Commissioner (Legal and Enforcement). The board will have a four-year tenure, according to the source. Buhari dissolved the previous board on July 16, 2015, and set up an eight-man panel headed by a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Babachir Lawal, two months later, to reconstitute it. Market operators had been calling for the  reconstitution of the board to strengthen SEC’s operations.
