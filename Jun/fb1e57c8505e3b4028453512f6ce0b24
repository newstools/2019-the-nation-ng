Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde now has an opportunity to live up to his campaign promises with the release of N7.9 billion bailout by the Federal Government, the state All Progressives Congress (APC) said on Tuesday. Its publicity secretary, Dr. Olatunde Azeez, gave this indication at the party’s secretariat while speaking on the successful inauguration of the National Assembly. Azeez said the governor had made certain promises during his electioneering campaign, including paying more than the approved N30,000 minimum wage. “Governor Makinde had said the workers of Oyo State deserve more than the money approved by the Federal Government. Now is the time to live up to that promise. He does not have any excuse not to pay with the money recently released to the state. I am sure the labour unions are aware too. The workers should have cause to smile, going by the governor’s promise. “I recall that the Ajimobi administration spent the bailout to clear arrears of workers’ salary in the state, about seven months’ arrears. Governor Makinde should equally take a cue from this,” Azeez said. According to Azeez, the bailout fund was enough to take care of the need of the state. “The issue of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology should also be tackled by the governor, especially with the promises made before the election. As governor-elect, Makinde had met the management of LAUTECH, where he again reiterated his promise to rescue the institution from the ‘claws of death’,” he said. The party spokesman also advised the state government to complete the purchase of the remaining vehicles for judges in the state. “The former governor had approved 12 vehicles for judges in the state, but due to paucity of funds could only buy six. The governor should, therefore, make it a point of duty to complete the purchase. It is a deserving gesture; the judiciary is an arm of government that is in no way subservient to the Executive arm,” Azeez said.
