The Non-Executive Chairman, Commonwealth International Telecoms Union (ITU) Group (CIG),  Dr Bashir Gwandu, has urged the government of Ethiopia to learn from the experience of Nigeria’s telecoms sector so as not to make mistakes. Gwandu who was a former commissioner and acting Executive Vice Chairman/CEO, Nigerian Communications Coomission (NCC), gave the advice  in his keynote speech at the Innovation Africa Digital Summit (IAD) 2019 held in Addis Ababa last week. He stressed the need for strong and good regulatory framework, encompassing sensible set of rules that encourage investment and protect the consumer, and requiring, effective, professionally competent and sufficiently empowered as well as sufficiently financed regulatory institution. He said good laws is not just sufficient but government support must be total and not half-hearted coupled with adequate funding that will attract good manpower to the regulator. Gwandu said governmet role should be restricted to policy formulation whilst a strong, independent regulatory authority should provide stable, transparent, fair, and non-discriminatory access to telecoms resources in a timely manner. The legal framework apart from guaranteeing independence of the regulator, must enable flexibility of the regulator whilst remaining predictable, efficient, effective and accountable. It should be the role of the regulator to ensure the existence of competition in all segments of the market devoid of market abuse or the exercise of significant market power by the participants, he said.
