Wife of Ogun State Governor, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun, has expressed her commitment to creating a database for widow’s registration in the state. This database, which will serve as a pool, will assist in financial literacy and skills and will be managed by the Ministry of Women Affairs. Mrs. Abiodun spoke during the 2019 International Widow’s Day in Cultural Centre Kuto, Abeokuta. She assured the current administration will also empower widows by providing them with tools, skills and support necessary to ameliorate hardship and lessen the burden of caring for their children after the demise of their husbands. She stated to drive home the objective, wives of chairmen of the various LGAs would ensure a communal quarterly meeting with all the widows in their LGAs with a view of monitoring them and tracking their development. The forum, she submitted, would also foster a sense of communal and sisterhood amongst all the widows. She was concerned that the effect of emotional and mental issues caused by grief from the loss of a husband had traditionally taken the back seat, saying this would be addressed by the present administration. According to her: “We understand the limitations caused by a poor emotional mental state and as such will be setting up monitoring and counseling schemes across the various widowed communities in the different LGAs. “We are committed to partnering with corporate organizations and private individuals to sponsor widows in Ogun state.” No fewer than 1,000 widows went home with gifts, cash and foodstuff during the occasion. Mrs. Adetola Quadri, a retired nursing sister and trader, who lost her husband some sixteen years ago, advised widows to make friends with their in-laws and not see them as enemies as their friendship with them would earn them support. Mrs. Mosunmola Oyefesobi urged widows to build courage and hold on steadfastly to God adding that nothing could be done without the help of God.
