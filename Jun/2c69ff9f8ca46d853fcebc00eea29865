HAT’S hotter this season than a little white dress? This is not my first trend alert for the little white dress. But it really is a trend for this season, and if you are in any doubt, please take a look at the fashionistas who have successfully worn a little white dress (LWD) in the past months, starting with my favourite, Betty Irabor, in her well-structured look. The beauty of this staple is that it goes with anything, you can dress it up or down and it’s far less common than the LBD. The fresh LWD works for pretty much any occasion, from a classic fit-and-flare to bodycon dress to lacy bohemian option, there’s a perfect LWD out there for every sense of style.
