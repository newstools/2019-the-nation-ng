Five children have been shortlisted at a kid’s auditioning organised by SPAR Nigeria, in partnership with Real Time Films (RTF) Festival. The children will feature with some Nollywood actors in a movie. Its Group Managing Director, Mr John Goldsmith, said it was part of Spar’s contribution to children’s development. “The future of the Nigerian society is in the way in which the children are developed. At SPAR, we are always looking for ways to creatively engage children and hone their skills. The partnership with Real Time Film Festival will help us to bring to fruition the aspiration of various children that are interested in the movie industry.” RTF Artistic Director Stanlee Ohikhuare thanked SPAR for partnering his organisation on the development of children for the creative industry. He said the auditioning helped to discover exceptional acting, monologue, dancing and singing skills in children. He said: “Plans are already underway to feature the shortlisted children in a film alongside Nollywood a-list actors and other celebrities. The movie will be premiered at the cinemas and also during the upcoming film festival.” SPAR translates the shopping experience of Nigerians and every shopper based on their choice, quality, service and value.
