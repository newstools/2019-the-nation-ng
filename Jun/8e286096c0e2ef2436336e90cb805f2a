Kwara state Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has appointed the popular historian and community leader Alhaji L’Aziz Kolawole (LAK) Jimoh as the leader of the state’s delegation to Hajj for 2019. Alhaji Jimoh was the proponent of the Otoge (enough is enough) movement that consumed the Saraki Dynasty in the 2019 general elections in the state “I have the honour to announce Alhaji LAK Jimoh, elder statesman and a Muslim figure, as the Ameerul-Hajj for Kwara State for the 1440 AH (2019) Hajj,” AbdulRazaq said in a statement by his spokesman Rafiu Ajakaye. “We believe that Alhaji LAK Jimoh will deploy his rich backgrounds as a Muslim leader, community elder and a custodian of the history of our people in the discharge of this important state duty.” The governor said the government would offer necessary support for the state’s contingent to the Holy Land. He called on all the intending pilgrims to be good ambassadors of the state and Nigeria as a whole.
