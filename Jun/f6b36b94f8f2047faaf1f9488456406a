Daughter of Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Kiki, has penned a touching note to celebrate her father, vice president of Nigeria, on social media. The 26-year-old shared lovely photos as she explained in a lengthy post how much her father means to her and her siblings as she described him as the best dad anyone can ask for. Kiki explained that her father was always available when it comes to showing up for his family on important days even if it was just with a phone call. She wrote: “This new place brought our family even closer than ever before. We are so proud of the work you are doing and we are ready to follow you on this next level journey. For the next four years daddy, let’s make history.”
