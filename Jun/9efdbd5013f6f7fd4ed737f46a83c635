Candidates, who participated in the recruitment test of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), have applauded the Group Managing Director of the Corporation, Dr. Maikanti Baru, for organising a transparent and fair exercise across the country. The aptitude test launched into the third stage on June 1 with a successful Computer Based Testing (CBT) for at least 60,000 candidates across 22 states. Some of the candidates who spoke to our reporter applauded the NNPC for the smooth process. A candidate, Iheoma Okeke, who participated in the Graduate Trainee test at Lead British International School centre in Gwarinpa, Abuja said: “ I am hopeful because the process was  smooth and organised. “What tripped me the most was that the officials were friendly and fair to everyone which is far from what I usually hear. “I commend the NNPC for this ongoing recruitment, I felt so relaxed during the accreditation because it was fast and okay,” Bunmi Adeleye said as she expressed joy. Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Services of NNPC, Isaiah Inuwa, said the test would have not been possible if the corporation had not collaborated  with some institutions to ensure the success of the programme.
