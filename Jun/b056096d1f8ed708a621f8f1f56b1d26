An Igando Customary Court in Lagos on Tuesday dissolved the four-year-old marriage of a businesswoman, Mrs Lydia Nwaru and Daniel, her husband. The petitioner told the court that Daniel, with whom she had a daughter, wanted to be “househusband”. The court’s President, Mr Adeniyi Koledoye, held that the husband’s repeated refusal to appear in court would not stop the proceedings. “Throughout the duration of this case, the respondent refused to honour court processes, in spite of being served with all court processes. Therefore, the court has no other choice than to dissolve the marriage. “The court pronounced the marriage between Lydia and Mr Daniel Nwaru dissolved. Both parties, henceforth, cease to be husband and wife. “Each of you should go on his or her separate way. The court wishes both of you well in your future endeavour,” he said. Koledoye said the only child of the marriage should be in the petitioner’s custody. He ordered Daniel to be responsible for the child’s upkeep and education, whenever the need arises, and when he is gainfully employed. Earlier, the petitioner said: “my husband is not ready to work. He prefers to stay at home. Whenever I complain about his idleness, he turns it to fight. “I have been responsible for the upkeep of the family, including school fees and rent.” She said she raised N120,000 for him to start a business but two weeks after she gave him the money, he did not do or say anything concerning the money. “I gave him another N86,000 to register for a job; the money went into nothing. “Thereafter, he started complaining that Nigeria was not suitable for progress; that he wanted to travel abroad to hustle,” she added.
