Residents of Agge community in Bayelsa State have given Sterling Oil Exploration and Production Company (SEEPCO) Nigeria two weeks to stop operations in the area. The community leaders and youths threatened to shut SEEPCO’s operation after months of bickering with the management of the indigenous oil firm over Global Memorandum of Understanding, development projects, employment slots, levies and royalties. A letter by the Chairman and Secretary of Agge Federated Communities, Messrs. Germain Irou and Erastus Orukemezuogha, reads: “We are constrained to give you the ultimatum which shall terminate on the June 20. We may be constrained to shut down your operations unless all the issues contained in our four separate letters are resolved. “For the avoidance of doubt, the issues for which we want urgent resolution are – your refusal to renew the expired GMoUs six months into a new year of their expiration; your two months dredging of the Agge River Ramos without any statutory approval and agreement with the Agge community; the operations of Yade Barge in the Agge Area and your refusal to pay land rents.” Other issues raised were the construction of land reclamation, shore protection wall/sand-filling, three full time employment slots and month royalties amounting to N360,000. SEEPCO’s Community Liaison Officer Konyefa Erebi could not be reached for comments. Irou, however, said the firm could avoid the planned confrontation if SEEPCO “creates a proper forum where the issues and many others in the River Ramos Area are resolved. But if they remain obstinate as they have done since the beginning of the year, we have no choice than to close their operations.”
