The Chief Executive/Managing Partner, Brandzone Consulting, LLC, Mrs. Chizor Malize has impressed on the three tiers of government, the need to extend information and communication technology innovation beyond financial services. Malize who was the guest lecturer at the 10th Annual Lecture/ Exhibition organised by the College of Management Sciences (COLMANS), Bells University of Technology, Ota, Ogun State, while noting that technological advancement is one of the indices for measuring a nation’s growth, however regretted that Nigeria has invested very little in science and technology over the past three decades, while the country’s gross expenditure for research and development as a percentage of GDP is 0.2% and that is half the world average of 0.4%. According to Malize, smaller countries such as Mozambique, Uganda, Mauritius and Rwanda are ahead of Nigeria with regards to investment in research. She added that the remarkable transformation recorded by Rwandans was driven by research, technology and innovation. “This lack of sufficient investment in Research by Nigeria is impending growth and development across several key sectors,” she said. The lecture, according to the Vice Chancellor, Bells University of Technology, Prof. Jeremiah Ojediran is timely because presently, attention is being called to technology, innovation, enterprise and how it affects our national growth. On his part, the Acting Dean, COLMANS, Dr. Femi Enilolobo, added that for Nigerian to take her place in the world, there is need for proper positioning through appropriate innovations, technology and enterprise.
