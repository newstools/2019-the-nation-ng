The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) yesterday warned pilots and airline operators to exercise caution during flight operations as the rainy season sets in because of thunderstorms. Spokesman of NCAA, Sam Adurogboye, in a statement, warned that the rainy season, prevalent in the Southern and Northern parts of the country was usually accompanied by thunderstorms which could impact the safety of flight operations. He said there were many other hazardous weather occurrences such as turbulence, micro-burst or low-level wind-shear and occasional hail events, which are bound to affect air navigation. He said the NCAA has directed all pilots to exercise restraint whenever adverse weather is observed or forecast by Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). Adurogboye said it has become mandatory for pilots and flight crew to obtain adequate, en route and destination weather information and briefing from NiMET Aerodrome Meteorological offices before flight operations.
