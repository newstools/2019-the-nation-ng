Residents of Halidu Avenue in Ekunpa Area of Otto Awori LCDA in Lagos State have cried out over the nefarious activities of drug dealers, smokers and open robbery by hoodlums in the community. One of the residents, Samusideen Akano, who spoke to The Nation, lamented the situation, which he said  has reached an alarming level. “The situation has become so bad that marijuana is peddled and smoked openly, even as the hoodlums engage in open-day robbery, snatching bags, phones and other valuables from passers-by.” Akano said what makes it more annoying is the fact that the criminal activities are taking place, not too far from the palace of the traditional ruler of the community, Kabiesi Elekunpa, Oba Rafiu Kosoko, raising tacit suspicion of complicity. Investigations by our reporter revealed that the leader of the hemp dealers, who lives in nearby Etegbin Road, uses his dark spot at the entrance of Halidu Avenue to attract hoodlums and drug addicts, thereby constituting nuisance and threat to safety in the area. Another resident who craved anonymity said, “We now live in constant fear of attack, even when going for our day-to-day business. “More worrisome is the fact that law enforcement agencies, that come around only patronize them for settlement and drive off. We are using this opportunity to appeal to the appropriate authorities, including the state government, local government, Shibiri Police Post, Area ‘K’ Command and other security outfits to wade in and rid the area of the hoodlums.” However, when the kabiyesi was contacted, he said he is not aware of any such activity. He advised anyone who has such allegation “to petition the police,” stressing that as a monarch, he hardly ventures out, except on important occasions.
