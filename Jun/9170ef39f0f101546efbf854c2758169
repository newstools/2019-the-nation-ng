An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court yesterday sentenced a 30-year-old man, Yusuf Mojeed, to one-year imprisonment for stealing a N40,000 phone in a mosque. Magistrate O.O. Adeshina convicted Mojeed after he pleaded guilty to a one-count charge of stealing. The sentence took effect from June 14 when the convict was arraigned. Earlier, prosecuting Inspector Rosemary Ehimegbe said Mojeed committed the offence at about 3:30pm on June 9, at a mosque on 2, Kofo Abayomi Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. Mojeed stole one Infinity Hot 7 phone, belonging to Aliu Mohammed. “The complainant was charging his phone in a mosque but slept off halfway. The defendant sneaked into the mosque, took the phone and fled. “He was arrested on June 13, but he had already sold the phone for N18,000. The police could not trace the buyer, so, the phone could no longer be recovered,” Ehimegbe added.
