The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has set up a 9-member committee to review the contentious House Rules of the 8th House. The House Rules Review Committee, which is headed by Hon. Prof. Julius Ihonvbere and is a mix of old and new members, has been given three weeks to wrap up its assignment. The term of reference for the committee is a wholesome review of the House Rules, with emphasis on contentious aspects which had set members against each other in the past. The committee is to align the House Rules to conform with global legislative best practices. Recall that the 8th House had been embroiled in contention over some aspects of the House Rules, which empowered the then Speaker, Yakubu Dogara to suspend indefinitely any member whom he “thinks” is walking towards the Mace with malevolent intent. Hon. Aliyu Madaki (APC Kano) with 10 ten others had headed for the court, urging it to declare the House Rules null and void and of no effect. According to them, the new House rules were draconian. The existence of the committee was said to have been shrouded to allow its members work without pressure and other impediments.
