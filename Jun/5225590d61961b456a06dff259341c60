The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti, Prof Kayode Olabanji, has promised to ensure that the hospital enjoys a pride of place among the comity of teaching hospitals in the country through quality service delivery. Olabanji, who addressed reporters in his office, said his administration will canvass and promote rebranding of the hospital by changing the negative attitudes of the service providers. According to him, the slogan “Your Hospital, My Hospital” was one of the ways to rebrand the hospital which is to improve the attitude and disposition of healthcare providers towards their work and clients by developing a stronger sense of belonging and attachment to the institution. The CMD, who said government alone cannot meet all the hospital’s need, appealed to well to do Ekiti indigenes at home and in Diaspora to contribute their quota to the development of the health institution. Prof. Olabanji promised that experience will be brought to bear in the hospital administration. He promised to prioritise worker’s welfare to motivate them to perform optimally, and assured the people that the hospital is up to the task of providing quality services. Prof. Olabanji was appointed the Chief Medical Director of EKSUTH by Governor Kayode Fayemi on May 14. He worked in many hospitals before settling down at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Osun State, where he rose through the ranks before his present appointment. He specialises in Plastic and Reconstructive surgery.
