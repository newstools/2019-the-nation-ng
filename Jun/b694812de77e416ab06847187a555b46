The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Financial Inclusion Secretariat has dissociated itself from several supposed financial inclusion trainings organized by some individuals who alleged to be linked and working together with the CBN. It says that it has not endorsed any individual to conduct financial inclusion trainings on its behalf or through partnership. “The Financial Inclusion Secretariat, Abuja directed FISSCO to inform the general public that it has come to its notice that several supposed financial inclusion trainings are being organized by individuals who are alleging to be linked and working together with CBN. “We, therefore, use this opportunity to disassociate the Financial Inclusion Secretariat and by extension the CBN from these trainings. ” This was contained in a press statement issued in Minna yesterday at the end of the two-day stakeholders’ engagement and 2019 second quarter Financial Inclusion State Steering Committee (FISSCO)  meeting in Niger state signed by Minna Branch Controller of CBN and Niger State FISSCO Chairman, Malam Mas’ud Ibrahim Tulu. The statement insists that “for the avoidance of doubt, the Financial Inclusion Secretariat has not endorsed any outfit to conduct financial inclusion training either on its behalf or in a supposed partnership.” FISSCO has said that such individuals are out to take advantage of the populace adding that they are using the name of CBN in order to be seen as credible. “These individuals take advantage of the vulnerable and gullible populace and defraud them of their money in the form of training fees and are using the name of FIS and CBN to garner credibility. “The general public should, therefore, be aware of the nefarious activities of these individuals and outfits.” The statement added that Niger state FISSCO is targeting to open 94,610 new accounts in 2019 adding that that 862 bank agents points and over 2,000 banking mobile agents have been approved operations in Niger state.
