The Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday warned members of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) and others, especially Chief Derin Adebiyi, not to politicise the death of real estate player and politician, Prince Jide Awosedo. In a statement by its State Publicity Secretary, Tunde Oladunjoye, the ruling party denied Adebiyi, who issued a statement as purportedly coming from Ogun APC on the death of Awosedo. The party emphasised that Adebiyi is not a member of the APC in the state and warned unsuspecting members of the public to discountenance the alleged dubious statement and his claim to being the state chairman of the party. APC said: “Our attention has been drawn to a statement dubiously issued in the name of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and signed by Chief Derin Adebiyi, posing as the Chairman of APC in Ogun State. “Firstly, we wish to alert the public that the statement did not emanate from our party; neither is the signatory a member of our party. In fact, they are well known members of an opposition party, who not only disrupted the presidential rally and wreaked physical assault on members of the APC, but also stoned President Muhammadu Buhari and his entourage at the M.K.O. Abiola Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, on February 11, 2019. “Secondly, we consider it as the height of wickedness, heartlessness and irresponsibility for the signatory, his cohorts and sponsor(s) to choose to play politics with the death of one of our foremost leaders in Ogun State at a time we are still in shock, and the family of the deceased was yet to come to terms with the sad loss of their bread winner.
