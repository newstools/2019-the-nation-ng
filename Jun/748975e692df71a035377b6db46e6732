It was a great outing as the 2019 The Ibejii Live Xperience (TILX) held at The Backyard, Lagos on June 12. The event hosted lovers of alternative music to the sounds of DopeL, the angelic Celeste and the guitar maestro, Godwyn Guitar, heralding the entry of the star attraction, Ibejii. Celebrities in the audience included Omawunmi, Brymo, Ozone and Aduke. Ibejii opened his performance with his haunting Midnight Strings from his awaited Scattered Elements project. This was followed by crowd favourites from his GreenWhite Dope and Tribal Marks albums. From Koyemi to Eda, Aye to Eko Blues, Ibejii’s rendition of 14 of his most loved songs had the crowd spellbound. His closing set featured Ba Mi Lo, Epiphany and other songs. The night proceeded with an afterparty where Ibejii’s new experimental music project, MSML, was formally launched. The next edition of The Ibejii Live Xperience is slate for June 12, 2020.
