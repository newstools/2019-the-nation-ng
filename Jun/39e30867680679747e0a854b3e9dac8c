The 52 matches of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, which holds in Egypt between 21st June and 19th July, will be broadcast live on DStv and GOtv via the SuperSport channels. This festival of African football will be live and in HD on DStv and the full offering of games will be available on GOtv. The SuperSport broadcast will feature expert opinion and insight from top commentators and veterans of the continental game. “We are thrilled to continue to cater to our customers’ football appetites with one of the most anticipated football tournaments of the year, and what makes it even more exciting this time around is that most of the countries we operate in are represented in AFCON 2019”, says MultiChoice Nigeria’s Chief Customer Officer, Martin Mabutho. The 2019 AFCON will be the 32nd edition of the continental tournament and takes places across six venues: Cairo International Stadium; 30 June Stadium, Cairo; Al Salaam Stadium, Cairo; Alexandria Stadium; Suez Stadium; and Ismailia Stadium. It is the first edition of the tournament to feature a new 24-team format. There are six groups of four teams each for the round-robin phase of the competition. The top two teams from each group, along with the four best third-placed teams, will advance into the last 16 and the tournament proceeds on a knockout basis from then on. Cameroon are the defending champions, having triumphed at the last edition in Gabon in early 2017.
