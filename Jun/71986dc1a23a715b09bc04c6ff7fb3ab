For the newly signed connectivity programme between Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and its Republic of Benin counterpart to work effectively and be beneficial to all stakeholders, there is a need for all stakeholders in the import-export trade to make sincere declarations on their consignment. This was the submission of the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) at the launch of the joint customs connectivity program between Nigeria and Benin Republic in Seme border. He said the new system will prevent abuse and other forms of unlawful acts associated with border businesses. He said: “This will not only facilitate trade but will also curb transborder crimes. We had a challenge with language but today we have scaled that hurdle. “Benin Republic and Nigeria are almost like one state divided by imaginary border line.This is a unique development for both countries. This system will weed out all false declarations. If you want your imports and exports to be treated fast, you must make honest declarations. This will bring an end to illicit trafficking.”
