The presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP), in the 2019 election, Dr. Kingsley  Moghalu, has called on  the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) to reposition the institute by rebranding the profession to make it attractive to  the younger ones. Moghalu made the appeal recently while delivering a keynote address at the 53rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the NIS inAwka, the Anambra State capital. He said the institution needed to rebrand the profession from surveying to geo-spatial technologies to appeal to the younger generation who are digitally driven. “The surveyor has not much meaning to younger ones. Whenever it is rebranded to reflect the digital world, many youths will be attracted to the profession. Rebranding from surveying to geo spatial technologies will make more sense to them,” he said. He said the world is digital and surveying must move with the trend to attract younger brains. Moghalu described surveyors as a critical institution in the development of any country, because they provide necessary data for national planning and development. According to him, Nigeria cannot plan without data and data for monitoring of natural disasters are provided by surveyors. Earlier, the NIS President, Mr. Alabo Charles, advocated for surveyors to have offices at local government councils.
