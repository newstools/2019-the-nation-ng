THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has withdrawn the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) results of four candidates. The candidates include: Adah Eche with   Registration Number 97512230IB, Taiwo Abisola Omowumi with  Registration Number 97049254GG, Vincent Onyinyechi Prisca with  Registration Number 96531098BC and Sofodun Afolasade Zainab    with  Registration Number  96634599GA. JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin made this known in a statement yesterday in Abuja. He said the candidates were involved in attempted fake JAMB result. “The Board therefore withdraws and invalidates the results of the four candidates found to have been involved in the illicit attempt to fake JAMB result. “No effort would be spared in identifying and sanctioning any candidate who attempts to falsify results of JAMB-organised examinations (UTME and others) and whoever collaborates or patronises such candidates would also face similar consequence,” the statement said. Eche was apprehended on Monday by the board for being in possession of a fake UTME result. He had attempted to upgrade his original UTME score of 153 to 290 with the help of a professional examination fraudster. According to JAMB, apart from being in possession of a fake UTME result, he was also working with the above- named candidates to have their scores inflated as well. Meanwhile, the board said it had released the results of 3, 736 who have been cleared of any infraction.
