A 50-year-old medical scientist, Michael Adeh, on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court for alleged N4.5 million fraud. Adeh, who resides in Ketu, Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of stealing, obtaining money under false pretences and issuing a dud cheque before Magistrate Mrs O. O. Fagbohun. Prosecuting Inspector Emmanuel Ajayi had told the court that the defendant committed the offences in 2014 at Ikeja, Lagos. Ajayi said the defendant allegedly fraudulently obtained N4.5 million from Mr Chamberlain Okezie for the execution of a contract, which he knew was false. He added that after five years of receiving the money, the defendant did not pay back. Ajayi also said when the complainant mounted pressure on the defendant, he issued a cheque of N4.5 million, which was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds. When the charges were read, the defendant pleaded not guilty to them. Magistrate Fadare granted him bail for N250,000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the matter till June 19.
