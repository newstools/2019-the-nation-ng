The rift between National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress(APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki appeared to have deepened as lawmakers-elect of Edo State House of Assembly rejected nomination for leadership of the House by the State Executive Committee of the APC. Three lawmakers-elect from Edo Central senatorial district are in the race for the position of the Speaker of Edo State. They are Frank Okiye (Esan North East 1); Emmanuel Okoduwa (Esan North East 11) and Victor Edoror (Esan Central). A meeting between the state leadership of the APC and the lawmakers-elect ended in deadlock as the lawmakers-elect insisted on not abiding by the decision of the party. Sources said the Edo APC stuck to Hon Frank Okiye as the Speaker but the lawmakers-elect rejected the proposal on ground that they should be given the independence to choose their leaders during plenary. The source said the lawmakers-elect argued that they would not allow Governor Obaseki pick their leaders for them. Another source said what the lawmakers-elect demanded was just proclamation letter from the Governor. It was gathered that the lawmakers-elect see Okiye as having the backing of Governor Obaseki while the two others have the backing of Oshiomhole. A chieftain of the party who pleaded anonymity said the lawmakers-elect were asked to go and choose their leaders based on zoning arrangement of the party. According to the source, the Speakership seat was zoned to Edo Central, Deputy Speakerâ€™s and Deputy Whip seat were zoned to Owan Federal Constituency while the Chief Whip seat was zoned to Edo South.
