NEWLY unveiled by Sparrow Records, singer Onyekachi Vincent, who goes by the stage name, Smart Khiddy, has said that he is all about content. Smart Khiddy who started music in 2012, sings Afro highlife and said he plans on reminding music lovers that there is still good music to be heard. “The sound might sound the same, but if you listen to the lyrics of my song, you will get a message,” said the artiste who was born in Ebonyi State but spent most of his childhood in Kano State. “I have songs already recorded and ready to be pushed out, but they have different sounds and meanings too. I am about positive thinking and that is what I want my music to be known for.” His first official single, titled ‘Na God,’ was produced by 2flexir, while the video was directed by Unlimited LA. Speaking at the event, the General Manager of Sparrow Records, Ibrahim Kabiru, expressed his belief that Smart Khiddy was going to take over the Nigerian music industry “in a few months’ time.” And speaking on the process that unearthed Smart Khiddy, he said: “We had over 100 upcoming artistes come for audition, but after going to his home to listen to some of his work that he had already recorded, I knew that we had made the best decision. And I won’t want to see such act wasted.”
