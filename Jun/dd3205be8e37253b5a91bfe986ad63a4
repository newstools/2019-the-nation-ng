Government of Anambra state state has commenced clearing and relocation of beggars from the streets of Nnewi, the industrial hub of the state. The raid being carried out by joint task forces from the Ministries of Social Welfare, Children and Women Affairs and Transport is targeted at sanitizing the state. The action is also aimed at paving way for easy flow of traffic as well as enhance the aesthetic beauty of the city. No fewer than seven women and twenty-five children from Ezzah, Ebonyi State were apprehended by the task force led by Commissioners from both ministries, Lady Ndidi Mezue and Mr. Uchenna Okafor. Speaking shortly after the raid, Lady Ndidi lamented the ugly behavior of some women who use their wards for alms thereby exposing them to
harsh conditions. She restated the commitment of the present administration in sanitizing the state of street beggars and miscreants. Some of the arrested beggars
said they resorted to begging due to financial difficulties and urgent need to make a living. One of them, Mrs. Cecilia Nwankwo confessed she made about N1,500 daily. “I don’t really like what I’m doing. But I just don’t have any other option than to beg in order to feed my children,” she lamented. The arrested beggars were brought to Awka, the state capital where the adults among them would be rehabilitated, while the children enrolled into schools.
