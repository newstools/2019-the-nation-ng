A 45-year-old teacher, Temitope Ogunlolu, on Monday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly forging her uncle’s house documents. The police also charged Ogunlolu with conducting herself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by forcefully and unlawfully displaying “Not for Sale” on her uncle’s apartments. She pleaded not guilty to the five-count charge. According to the prosecutor, Akeem Raji, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), the defendant had in her possession fake documents of Flat 7, Block 8, Millennium Housing Estate, belonging to Mr Oluwole Ogunlolu. Raji alleged that the defendant committed the offence sometimes in April on Alaagba Estate, Orile Agege. The prosecutor submitted that the uncle bought the apartment in the defendant’s name with an understanding that the defendant would return the property to him in due time. “The defendant advised the complainant to buy the flat in her name in order to reduce the cost, and the complainant obliged. “The defendant subsequently transferred the property back to the complainant through a deed of transfer with all the necessary documents. “The complainant was surprised when the defendant came up with funny stories that the property belonged to her,” he said. Chief Magistrate O.A. Layinka granted the defendant N100,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. Layinka ruled that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The sureties, she added, must be related to the defendant by blood and reside within the court’s jurisdiction. The magistrate adjourned till June 26.
