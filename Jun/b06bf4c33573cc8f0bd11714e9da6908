MOST Nigerians were aware of the recent judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying the victories of all the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State in the recently conducted elections. They knew that all the party’s candidates from the governorship to the National Assembly and House of Assembly elections had their mandates revoked by the apex court because it declared the party primaries from which they emerged as candidates null and void. Among those who lost their mandates was the immediate past governor of the state who had won the senatorial election for Zamfara West. But not known to many is the fact that the former governor’s losses from the landmark judgment were more than the nullification of his senatorial mandate. Not only his hope of becoming a senator was dashed; also dashed was his hope of installing his successor as governor. Added to the foregoing is the former governor’s dashed hope of becoming the Deputy Senate President. While his plot to become the Deputy Senate President was not known to many, many of the senators-elect in both the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party were aware of his scheming. Although he endorsed Senator Ahmed Lawan’s candidacy for Senate President, he believed that he was more qualified than any other person to be Deputy Senate President, based on his years as a member of the House of Representatives and eight years as governor. While many of his colleagues in APC were unhappy that he was disregarding the party’s zoning of the office to the South-south, none could call his bluff because of his perceived deep pocket. But as fate would have it, the Supreme Court halted the aspiration.
