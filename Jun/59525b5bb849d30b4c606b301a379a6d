 After a very unimpressive outing against Norway in the opening match losing 3-0, Super Falcons Coach Thomas Dernneby and his girls will today embark on a salvage mission against Korea Republic in their second match. The interesting thing about today’s encounter is that both teams lost their opening matches with no point in the kitty which makes it a fight to the finish encounter. Hosts France lead the group after beating Korea 4-0 with three points followed by Norway with 3 points but with an inferior goal difference. While France and Norway will be seeking consolidation in their next matches, Korea and Nigeria will be hoping to get back into reckoning as losing another match will signal exit or near exit situation for them. Most fans who reacted following the 3-0 loss to Norway on June 8 insist Falcons must be more purposeful if they are to avoid early exit in France. The team has been to the world Cup a record seven times crashing out in the group stage six times with the Quarterfinals of 1999 edition as the highest achievement that has been achieved. Some had prior to the start of the championship predicted that the team will do better citing their preparation and participation to pre-tournament championships including the Cyprus invitational as the reason for such expectations. Falcons’ last group match will be against France on June 17, and there are fears that the hosts may be thinking and planning to re-enact the feat they achieved on April 6th 2018 when they hammered Falcons 8-0 in a friendly match played at the Stade Le Mans. Twenty seven goals has already been scored in the ongoing championship with the opening match between France and Korea Republic producing the highest number of goals 4-0, followed by 3-1 defeat of South Africa by Spain, 3-0 defeat of Nigeria by Norway and 3-0 defeat of Jamaica by Brazil.
