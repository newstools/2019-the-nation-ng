A midnight Â fire has razed over 30 shops at the PZ market in Evboriaria, Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. The fire was said to have been caused by an electric surge. Many of the victims said they left money in their shops. Blessing Justina, who owns a beauty shop, said she was informed about the fire by a relative but could not remove anything from her shop. Chairman of Ikpoba-Okha council Eric Osayande, who visited the scene, directed the Councillor of Ward 6, Obosa Jolly Ogbeide, to embark on a needs assessment exercise of the burnt market. Dr. Osayande also directed the Head of Local Government Administration (HOLGA), Kingsley Iyamu, and Director, Administrative and General Services (DAGS) Frank Osa-Idahosa to prepare a white paper draft for approval to rebuild the market.
