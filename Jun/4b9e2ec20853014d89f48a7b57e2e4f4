Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has assured that the Federal Government working closely with the State Governments will rid the country of kidnappings. According to him, the current wave of the menace will result in a more secure nation. He made the remark during a town hall meeting the Nigerian community in New York. In an exchange with reporters in the United States of America on Wednesday, the Vice President’s spokesman, Laolu Akande said he had seen some of the reports and the subsequent reactions of some group including a faction of Afenifere. According to him, “a closer reading of what the VP said would have avoided some of the wrong interpretations we have heard.” He said that the four critical points the VP made included “The VP made clear that indeed the kidnappings going on where they do, are a concern to the government. “Besides that he added that the FG is using technology and tracking to curtail the situation. “Prof Osinbajo explained that the kidnappers are engaged in criminal conduct and with consequences enforced for such economic crimes, the kidnappers would stop. “Finally, the VP assured Nigerians both home and abroad that the FG is on top of the situation and that the problem of kidnapping is not unsurmountable. He said the problem is not as massive that it cannot be solved and the FG working with the States would solve it soon and make life more secure and comfortable for Nigeria.” According to Akande, these are the things the VP said and the record is there. Any other interpretation, he said, is not only inaccurate but ought to be ignored. “Trying to latch on an inaccurate headline to attack the Vice President is not very useful, it only distorts and distracts from the work and our country needs all hands on deck to sort out our issues” Akande concluded.
