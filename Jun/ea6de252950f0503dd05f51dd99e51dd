Despite going a goal down, Ukraine defeated South Korea 3-1 in the 2019 Fifa U-20 World Cup final at the Lodz Stadium, Lodz on Saturday evening. Both teams were playing in their first-ever U-20 World Cup with the Ukrainians never going beyond the last 16. The South Koreans’ best showing was fourth in 1983. The game started on a frenzy note with Kang-In Lee racing to put Korea in the lead when he put the ball into Ukraine’s net from the penalty spot in the fifth minute. Four minutes after the half hour, the Eastern European side levelled up matters after the Koreans failed to deal with a dead ball. Vladyslav Supriaha sent a low shot beyond goalkeeper Kim Lee. The first half ended 1-1 with all to play for in the second stanza. Supriaha grabbed his brace seven minutes into the second half before Giorgi Tsitaishvili extinguished the fire in the Koreans with a killer punch one minute from the end of playtime.
