Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has advised residents to desist from the habit of dumping refuse on the drainages and other water channels to prevent flooding and the attendant dangers in the state. Abiodun said the state government would devise a comprehensive plan to address the challenges of waste disposal and flooding, adding that the drains that serve as carriage would be re-designed to accommodate flow of large volume of flood water. The governor made this known on Monday while on an inspection tour of some parts of Ijebu- Ode  town, including Igbeba, Paramount, Moborode, Italapo, Degun and Imowo- Ibadan roads that were affected by flood few days ago. He said he decided to visit the affected areas and see first-hand what flood has done to the town, urging the residents to be patient with the state government in its determination to find lasting solution to the menace. Abiodun noted that he was only fulfilling the promise he made during his campaign not to forget the people if voted into office. He sympathised with those whose homes were overtaken by the flood, reiterating the need for the people to always clean the drainages close to them to allow for easy flow of water and save the roads constructed with public fund from being washed away. He said: “From what we have seen here, the biggest problem we have in Ijebu Ode is that the drains that crisscross the town are small concrete drains that are covered, so they don’t allow for maintenance, they are very tiny. Ijebu-Ode will require very big open drains that can easily be serviced and maintained, so we are going to have a comprehensive plan aimed at resolving these problems once and for all.”
