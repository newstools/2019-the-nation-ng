To enable market vendors penetrate more markets online at an attractive  fee, Great Jonliz- Betty   Nigeria Limited has unveiled its online market place, Jonliz Market.com in Lagos. According to its Chief Executive Officer, Prince Olaniyi Karounwi, the  online market brand does  not charge  commission on sold products. “Our platform is designed in a multi-vendor setting.  We have four categories of subscription packages; N5,000, N15,000, N39,000 and N69,000. If you sign up on the packages, it allows your store to run on the platform for 90 days. “We don’t  run on commission. For example, if you sign up for a N5,000 package, if you sell up to any amount of money, Jonliz market.com pays you the entire amount of money, we don’t take commission and that is the stark difference between Jonliz and other platform,” he said. Having established the market at Benin Republic   nine years ago,  Karounwi explained that there was the need for the country to have an indigenous market platform. The online market started off four months ago. He added that their goods are of  quality and the prices competitive.
