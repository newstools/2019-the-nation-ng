The statement noted that Akedesuo was busy working to finish strong with his boss and would not be distracted by such report It said: “We wish to state categorically that Joseph Akedesuo has never declared such intention to join the Bayelsa governorship race because he is too busy working to bequeath an enduring legacy for the Restoration government and cannot even campaign as others are doing presently. “The said publication is false and should be disregard by the general public as it is maliciously intended to malign the good image of this hardworking, loyal and committed aide of Governor Seriake Dickson. “The said report, which appears to be conjectures from the writer’s imagination is incomprehensible, inconsistent and gross misrepresentation of the realities on ground. “We, hereby, reject and disassociate ourselves from any report purporting that the Director of Protocol has declared to contest the governorship election. “However, we also wish to note that the Director of Protocol, Mr. Joseph Akedesuo as a Nigerian and ardent believer in the programmes and policies of Governor Dickson, is qualified and have all it takes to contest for any elective position in the land under our constitution. “Based on his experience, impeccable character and passion for service, some interest and youth groups had called on Akedesuo to contest and pledged their support and loyalty to him. But he is yet to declare his intention to contest”.
