New and returning lawmakers in the Niger State House of Assembly will today elect a Speaker ahead of inauguration of the ninth Assembly. The immediate past Speaker Ahmed Marafa Guni and a member of the eighth Assembly, Madaki Malik Bosso, are in the race for the seat. Although there is a third contender, said to be the government’s candidate, the lawmaker has not come out to declare his intention. In two different interviews, Guni affirmed that he joined the race to lead the Assembly for the second time and was confident of winning. Marafa said the recent amendment to the Assembly’s Standing Rules, which only allow ranking members to contest leadership positions, was not meant to deny newcomers the opportunity to contest. “Tell me where this is not obtainable. All over the world, parliaments respect this tradition where members who served more than once are privileged to become leaders over those who are new. It’s a natural phenomenon,” he said. Bosso expressed the confidence that old and new members would vote for him to become Speaker. He said as a returning member from Zone B and from the majority party, he has all the qualifications to vie for the position.
