The Nigeria Wrestling Federation has fixed 23rd of June as the deadline date for States and wrestling clubs that wished to participate at the forthcoming 3rd Governor Dickson Wresling Classics. The Technical Director of the NWF, Damien Ohaike, informed NationSport that the there is no intention by the federation to shift the date of the competition that will be staged from 23rd to 30th June, 2019 at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Samson Siasia Sports Stadium in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. No fewer than 500 athletes and officials from different states and wrestling clubs around the country are expected in Yenagoa for the competition which will also serve as qualifiers for this year’s Africa Games in Morocco and the World Wrestling Championships in Kazakhstan in September. Ohaike said Bayelsa State have assured the federation of hosting a memorable competition. “The registration will close on the 23rd the arrival day. All the states and clubs are now aware of this. “Not withstanding the funding, the competition will still go ahead. The state government has assured us of making necessary funds available. It is usually the normal thing and when they see the athletes coming in, they will do something urgently. As at now, we don’t have any intension of shifting it. Any shift in the date will encroach in the national program for the African Games. “So we are also expecting money for the camping of the African Games. In this competition, we are going to use it as trials for the selection of athletes for the African Games. If we don’t do it now, convening the athletes again is another money. So we use that opportunity as our trial,” Ohaike told NationSport.
