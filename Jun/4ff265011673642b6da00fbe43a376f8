Prospective private candidates of the 2019 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) – Second Series (Aug/Sept WAEC GCE) across the country can now conveniently purchase their registration Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) through any of the multiple channels available on Remita, the leading electronic payment platform. This agreement was made recently as the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) announced the kick off of the sale of WAEC GCE registration PINs to start on May 27 and end on July 19. To enjoy this service, intending candidates are to visit the Remita website or mobile app and choose a preferred payment channel of the many options available which include Debit/Credit Card, Internet Banking, Mobile Wallet (Pocket Moni, Paga, etc), branches of banks,  and at designated agent locations across the country. Once payment is completed, the exam registration PIN is delivered to the candidate’s email and also displayed on the Remita payment receipt sent to the same email. The candidate is then expected to proceed to WAEC’s website to complete registration with the obtained PIN.
