The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has warned stakeholders in the downstream oil sector not to do anything that could undermine the seamless supply and distribution of petroleum products that currently prevails across the country. The Group Managing Director, NNPC, Dr. Maikanti Baru, who made this plea at the launching of Petroleum Products Pipeline Marketing Company (PPPMC) Business Automation with SAP Modules and Web-Based Customer Express in Abuja yesterday said Nigerians must not be subjected to any form of stress in  products supply and distribution. PPMC is a downstream subsidiary of the NNPC. Referring to the recent incident that occurred in Calabar Depot which led to the disruption of products loading and the consequent hiccup in products supply in Cross River State for three days before normalcy was restored, Baru appealed to stakeholders, especially the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), and the Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) to resolve their differences in the interest of the citizens of this country. The NNPC, in a statement, quoted Baru as saying:  “We have stability in fuel supply, the citizens should not be punished by unions who are supposed to make life better and comfortable for their members.”
