When he’s in the mood, President Buhari speaking off the cuff can be a nightmare for his handlers. And so he proved yet again over the Sallah holidays while receiving Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and a delegation from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Referring to the shellacking handed him at the polls in February by his neighbours in the nation’s capital, the president promised not to pay back in kind. “I am not threatening FCT because to make FCT secure is to make myself secure and the Vice President. I think they are a necessary evil that was why they decided to vote for PDP,” he said. Predictably, Buhari’s comment has attracted a fair amount of criticism from those who cannot understand what he was playing at calling a section of the electorate – even if they voted against him – a ‘necessary evil.’ The typical dictionary defines the expression as “something undesirable that nevertheless must be tolerated in order to attain a desired end.” For context, perhaps he was moaning about having to cohabit with people who are not on the same wavelength with him politically. As is sometimes the case with him, the remark was made half-jokingly. But as bad jokes go, this one was appalling. It reminds me of when former US Democratic Party presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, declared in September 2016 that half of Donald Trump’s supporters could be put in a “basket of deplorables.” It was a gaffe that she would live to regret. Her opponent,  kept hammering away at her slip of tongue. As for those offended, they wore the insult like a badge of honour waiting to punish the former First Lady at the polls in November that year. Luckily for Buhari, he won’t be running for office again. Otherwise, his foes would be waiting to beat him over the head with his momentary indiscretion.
