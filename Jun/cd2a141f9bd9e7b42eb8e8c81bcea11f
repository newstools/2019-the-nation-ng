Thousands of thugs on Saturday evening invaded the venue of a national convention to elect new leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and disrupted the process. It was gathered the election was concluded and counting and sorting of votes was in progress when the thugs invaded the venue. The number of the thugs reportedly overwhelmed security agents, who tried in vain to stop the hoodlums. It was learnt the hoodlums claimed they were excluded from the process of the convention and alleged thatÂ the list of delegates for the election contained under aged delegates. The rowdy scenario halted the process and compelled the convention committee to shift the election by a day following advice from security personnel. But some claimed that the hoodlums carted away the ballot boxes containing votes for president and vice-president of the union. It was, however, gathered that Chief Broadrick Bozimo, who was a presidential candidate, Chief Francis Doukpola, Vice President Central and Inatimi Spiff,( National Secretary) were in clear lead when the youths interrupted the process and forcefully dispersed everybody. The youths invaded the generator house, vandalized the generator before the attacked the electoral officials.
