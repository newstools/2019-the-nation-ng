BURSASPOR of Turkey defender, Shehu Abdullahi expects to make a swift return to the Super Eagles’ squad after banishing any concerns over his ankle worry. Abdullahi was injured during Nigeria’s’1-0 win over Burundi in the Group B Africa Cup of Nations clash on Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt. The defender came off the pitch in the first half and was replaced by Chidozie Awaziem, after 42 minutes of action. He suffered a hamstring and the setback made him a doubt for the rest of the competition, but there might be cheerful news as the player posted an injury update. Abdullahi believes he will soon be back in action. He wrote on Twitter: “Thanks for the love Nigerians; I appreciate your amazing messages. I will be back soon! The most important thing, keep supporting us, we shall make you proud at the end and conquer Africa. I love you all.” Abdullahi struggled with injury blight last season with Bursaspor and was restricted to 13 league matches for the club, and was a questionable inclusion in the final 23-man list for the competition. Unfortunately for the 26-year-old, he suffered a recurrence of a condition that plagued his game all-season when he pulled out just before half-time against Burundi. Although the injury looked serious and was initially feared it could keep him out for the rest of the competition, Abdullahi tweeted an update and it was positive.
