The Niger state Police Command has discovered some buildings that serve as hideouts for kidnappers in Minna, Niger state. The Nation confirmed that three of such buildings in Bosso area in Minna, discovered following tip off by some members of the community, have been sealed up by the Police as security operatives have been drafted to the area. The Nation learnt that when the police raided the houses, seven people were arrested while some AK47 rifles were recovered. Efforts made to get information from the Police have proved abortive. When The Nation called the state Police Public Relations Officer, Abubakar Muhammad, he said he was out of the town for a course but was able to confirm knowledge of the buildings. He, however, said any information given out now may jeopardize their investigation saying that investigation is ongoing. However, the police spokesman said once investigation is concluded, journalists would be called and adequately briefed. “We are already investigating the matter when we finish our investigation we will let you know the details”, he said. Efforts made to get to the houses were not possible as security men did not allow anyone to go close to the houses. The police commissioner, Adamu Usman, told some newsmen that they were tampering with their investigations warning them not to get close to the houses. However, residents around the vicinity where the houses were discovered confirmed the raid by police saying a number of persons were arrested but could not ascertain the number.
