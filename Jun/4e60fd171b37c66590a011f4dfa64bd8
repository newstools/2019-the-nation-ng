 All work and no play it is said makes Jack a dull boy! Perhaps that explains why Super Eagles, who have been shaping up for the forthcoming Nations cup, took time Friday to tour the Suez Canal in Egypt. The Eagles who are expected to take on Taranga Lions of Senegal on Sunday in a friendly match before the main competition appeared to have thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour of ever popular Suez Canal, as players and technical crew alike were beaming with smiles and reliving their experience. The Gernot Rohr led team revealed the excursion in their official twit, revealing “We took time off our tough #TotalAFCON2019 training routine this morning to go on a tour of the Suez Canal in Ismailia. Very pleasant experience” An equally excited Rohr posed for photograph with the captain of the cruise ship. The Suez Canal is a sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869, it was officially opened on 17 November 1869. The canal in recent time has become a major tourist attraction and a must visit for most visitors to the land of the Pharaohs. One thing most visitors to the Suez Canal look forward to is an enjoyable taste of fresh seafood.  Here you can pick out your choice of the freshest catch of the day, then relax while the fish is cooked to perfection or pay for your goods by weight ready to take home.
