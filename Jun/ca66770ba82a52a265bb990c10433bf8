The Delta state police command says it has arrested two persons, including a prominent Abraka chief, in connection with the reported murder of an 18-year old girl, Favour Ogheneyenrowho. It would be recalled that the corpse of Ogheneyenrowho had been found tied up in a ‘Ghana-must-go’ bag and dropped at a refuse dump site behind Ozoro Park in Abraka on the June 18. The police had been on the trail of a suspect, believed to be Ogheneyenrowho’s boyfriend, with whom he was last seen by her older sister, who identified herself as Maureen Sunday. The name of the suspect was still unknown as at the time the corpse of the victim was found. However, the police, in a statement issued and circulated by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Delta State police command, DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya, said two suspects, including one Henry Ikechukwu, a 32-year old, believed to be the boyfriend the deceased was last seen with, and an unnamed ‘prominent’ chief in Abraka. “Subsequently, in the course of Police investigation, the deceased male friend one, Henry Ikechukwu, aged 32 years old, who was last seen with the deceased on 17th of June, 2019 and had been on the run since the incident, was tracked down and arrested on 28th of June, 2019. “On interrogation, he confessed to have invited the deceased for an outing on 17th of June, 2019, from where he lured her and handed her over to a prominent chief in the same Abraka community, who gave him the assignment to get the deceased for him. “The said chief has also been arrested and the two suspects are presently in Police custody pending investigation. They will soon appear in court immediately after the completion of the ongoing Police investigation”, the statement said. Efforts to confirm the identity of the “prominent chief” from the police spokesperson, Onowakpoyeya, was unsuccessful as she neither picked calls put across to her nor returned missed calls.
