State-owned tertiary institutions in Osun State have rejected the government’s plan to start the deduction of 1.5 per cent as premium from their basic salary for the health insurance scheme. A letter dated June 20, 2019, and signed by the Academy Staff Union of Polytechnics, ASUP, Osun State Polytechnic, Iree; Osun State College of Technology, Esa-Oke; College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) Colleges of Education, Ila-Orangun and Ilesa, urged the government to exclude the institutions from the deduction in the interest of industrial peace. The letter addressed to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola was in response to the government’s letter titled: “Commencement of 1.5 per cent Deduction as Premium from the Basic Salary of all Public Servants in the state and Alignment of all state-owned Tertiary Academic Institutions with the Osun Health Insurance Scheme Tertiary Institution Social Health Insurance Programme”. The letter reads in part: “We acknowledge the effects of the government to improve the general welfare of workers and residents in our dear state. The circular under reference dictates that as from May 2019, 1.5 per cent of salary would be deducted while government wills 3 per cent as counterpart fund to provide health insurance scheme for workers in the state. “We are constrained to use this medium to request for exemption from Osun State Health Insurance Scheme.”
