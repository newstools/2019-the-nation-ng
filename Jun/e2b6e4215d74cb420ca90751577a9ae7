Jeremy Hunt, one of the leading candidates vying to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May, said he would leave the European Union without a deal, but with a heavy heart. He added that he hoped the bloc would engage with a new British leader. “Our failure to deliver Brexit has put our country and our party in grave peril. “The leadership I offer is based on one simple truth: without Brexit, there will be no Conservative government and maybe no Conservative Party. “If we want a deal, we are going to have to engage seriously with Brussels. “From my conversations with European leaders, it is clear to me there is a deal to be done, they want us to come up with proposals,” Hunt said. Hunt, who is foreign secretary, said that with a “more aggressive Russia” and a “more autocratic China”, he would boost defence spending if he became prime minister. “Peace comes through strength. “With a more aggressive Russia and a more autocratic China, I pledge to increase the proportion of our GDP we spend on defense,” Hunt said.
