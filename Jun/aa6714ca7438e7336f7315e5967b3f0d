Unknown gunmen, suspected to be hired assassins, Friday night, raided the country home of the immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha in Ogboko, Ideato South Council Area of Imo State. The assailants according to a family source, arrived the governor’s residence at about 2 am and overpowered the security before gaining entrance into the main building. According to the source who pleaded anonymity, no valuable was removed but the former governor’s bedroom and other places were thoroughly ransacked, raising suspicion that the invaders maybe hired assassins. Meanwhile, another set of armed men suspected to be Government officials, stormed a radio station, the Reach FM, believed to be owned by the governor and ordered them to pull down the structure housing the station. According to one of the security men attached to the station, the armed men who refused to disclose their identity gave the management three days to pull down the structure or be ejected by force. This was coming two days after the Akachi tower, one of the monuments built by the former governor was demolished on the alleged orders of the State Government. However, when contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, a Superintendent of Police, said that he was yet to be officially briefed about the invasion of the governor’s home.
