House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Lasun Yussuff has threatened to take legal action against the Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, Moustapha Cisse Lo, over allegation of collecting payment without attending ECOWAS plenary. Lasun, who also threatened to sue the ECOWAS secretariat alongside the Speaker, should they fail to retract the statement, said at no time did he demand to be paid nor did he receive any payment. Cisse Lo, in his closing remark at the ECOWAS session in Abuja last Friday, reportedly said Nigeria’s Deputy Speaker and other members of the nation’s delegation to the plenary received full payment without attending plenary. But Lasun has since denied the allegation. Lasun described the statement as worrisome and embarrassing. Speaking through his Press Secretary, Mr. Wole Oladimeji, the Deputy Speaker, who also doubles as first Deputy Speaker of ECOWAS Parliament, stressed that if by Thursday the Speaker and secretariat fail to retract his claim, he would proceed to the court. “By Thursday, the Speaker and the secretariat should be expecting legal action, should they fail to retract the claim,” Yussuff said. He said: “I have been out of the country since two weeks ago. I was worried and embarrassed that the speaker could go dirty at plenary to make unparliamentarily remark about my person.”
