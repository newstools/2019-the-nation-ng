Roger Federer accepted his straight-set loss to Rafael Nadal in the French Open semifinals in a very fair way. Speaking to the Swiss reporters, as quoted by Telebasel, the world No. 3 said: “I am 37 years old. I can handle those situations. I will not cry tonight. It was like being in a sand hole. Rafa and I should wash our eyes to see what we eat (laughter). It’s never fun to lose in straight sets”, said Federer, who confirmed he will head into Halle at the end of next week. On Federer, Nadal’s coach Carlos Moya said: “He is a better clay-courter than what people may think. If Rafa was not there, Federer would have held four or five Roland Garros.” Analyzing Federer’s loss to Nadal, Heinz Gunthardt said: “I think it was an unbelievable match in those conditions. The wind was not only strong but it kept turning around. Federer really played unbelievably well. But if Nadal is fit, he is just too good.” Marco Chiudinelli concluded: “For two sets I saw two same players. Unfortunately, Federer could not win the key points. The wind was not definitely pleasant. You’d better play when it’s not windy. But it happens.”
