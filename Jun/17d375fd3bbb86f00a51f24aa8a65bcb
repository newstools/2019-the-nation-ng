American stand-up comedian and actor, Bill Cosby 81, is dishing out parenting, drug use and life advice to his fellow inmates. Cosby was convicted in 2018 to three to 10 years in a state prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, as well as aggravated indecent assault. His rep, Andrew Wyatt, says the famous inmate’s a busy man behind bars with as many as four lectures per week, says TMZ. “He’s been doing this for around 3 months with crowds that often swell to more than 100 fellow prisoners.’’ Cosby’s pitch that the inmate’s lead by example for their kids and stay outta prison in the future, further encouraging them to re-bond with their kids immediately upon getting out. The actor works most with a group called “Man Up” inmates set for parole talking life lessons, keeping out of trouble and not getting locked up again. “We’re told Cosby’s also lecturing on finding work post-prison, giving them tips on interviewing techniques. He also lectures on substance abuse tips on how to stay clean. He got skewered on social media for his Father’s Day tweet for calling himself “America’s Dad” but the comedian truly embraces the title in prison. (NAN)
