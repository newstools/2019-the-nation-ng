Australia came from two goals down to beat Brazil 3-2 in the FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup on Thursday at Montpellier in France. An own goal from Monica capped a superb fightback and overshadowed a milestone goal for the 33-year-old Marta. She became the first player to score at five different FIFA World Cups as she put Brazil ahead from the penalty kick spot with a record-extending 16th World Cup goal. Cristiane then doubled the lead. But Caitlin Foord reduced the arrears on the stroke of halftime before Chloe Logarzo equalised and Monica beat her own goalkeeper to hand Australia all three points. Brazil and Australia both have three points in Group C as do Italy, who take on Jamaica on Friday after beating the Matildas in their opening match. NAN
