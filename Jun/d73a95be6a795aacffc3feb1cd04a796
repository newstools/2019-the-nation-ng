Enyimba midfielder Austin Oladapo has set his sights on the top prize of the Nigeria Professional Football League playoffs which begins at the Agege Stadium on Tuesday. The six-team tournament will offer The People’s Elephant, alongside five others, the opportunity to claim the NPFL title, as well as entry into Africa’s Club Competitions next season. Oladapo, was an integral part of Enyimba’s qualification for the playoffs with consistent performance in the regular season, and the CHAN 2018 silver medallist is bidding to replicate such displays and win laurels for his team. “I am hungry for glory,” the 23-year-old began. “This is an opportunity for me because I’ve not been able to win any major trophy. I know what the premiership will mean to me, to my career, to my family as a whole. So I’m desperately waiting for the super six to kick off on Tuesday and I’m hoping I’ll be able to give out my best that will give me this major League at the end of the day.” Aware of the quality of the opposition at the tournament, Oladapo knows exactly what Enyimba must do to win silverware. “We know the teams – Rangers, Lobi, Kano Pillars, and Akwa. They are all big teams and we are here to fight. We are here to fight too because we know what we want and it’s not going to be easy. We are here to fight to make sure at the end of the day we are able to get what we want” Enyimba will be involved in the opening game of the tournament, with a crunch clash with Rangers International set for 3pm.
