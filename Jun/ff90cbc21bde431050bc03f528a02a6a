Centre for Peace and Environmental Justice with the active participation of Out of School Empowerment Foundation held a sensitization programe and a community walk for residents of Akodo community of Ibeju Lekki Local Government area of Lagos. The theme of the event Beat Air Pollution was coined in order to create awareness on the various forms of air pollution and ways to tackle them. A representative of the Lagos state Ministry of Environment, Mrs Bolanle Odubelu reiterated governmentâ€™s unflinching support for communities and needy areas through the environmental services department. She lamented the deplorable state of the environment especially the illegal refuse dump which poses numerous health hazards. According to her, the environment has been vandalised and urgent measures need to be taken to get the environment salvaged. Mrs Odubelu said a major part of the advocacy is to make sanitary materials available to the local people and also the regular servicing of the waste disposal trucks in order to minimise emissions from their exhaust. Baale of Akodo community, Chief Adebayo Ogunlaja expressed his appreciation to the CEPEJ and pledged that the community will ensure that the materials and information given to them are adequately used, adding that activities that endanger the environment such as smoking of fish and crayfish, use of kerosene stoves, use of generators, smoking of cigarettes and others are brought to the barest minimum. He made a request for more face masks and other sanitation materials.
