The General manager Public Relations, NAMA, Mr Khalid Emele, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos. Emele said Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) has been issued to airlines concerning the reopening of the runway which was closed after an Air Peace Flight P47291 overshot the runway on Saturday. Also, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), confirmed that the B737-500 aircraft had been towed from the site.
