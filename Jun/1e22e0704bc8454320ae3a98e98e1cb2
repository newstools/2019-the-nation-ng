The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) has slammed Kano Pillars captain Rabiu Ali with a 12-match ban. It also fined Kano Pillars N8m and condemned the club to playing three home games behind closed-doors. Ali is being punished for his role in the violence after the NPFL Super Six match day 4 fixture between Pillars and Enugu Rangers on Monday at the Agege Stadium. After the final whistle in the game, Ali rushed to the referee and despite being held back by teammates, he was seen barking at the official, who had to run away before the enraged fans attack him. According to an official statement issued by the LMC on Wednesday, Ali was charged for accosting the referee and in so doing incited others to commit acts of violence and misconduct in breach of Rule C1.3 The notice to Ali reads: “Consequently, and taking into consideration your role as the captain of the team, by which your conduct is deemed to be an aggravated breach with a view to imposing more severe sanctions pursuant to Rule C19, the LMC intends to exercise its summary jurisdiction and to impose on you the following sanction: a ban from all NPFL matches and activities for a period of twelve (12) matches, commencing immediately”. The Kano Pillars captain, who scored in the 1-1 draw against the Flying Antelopes, has been given 48 hours to accept or appeal the charges and sanctions against him in writing.
