Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Chairman Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado on Monday declared that the commission was not under the influence of any person to investigate the financial dealings of the state emirate council. Rimingado, who spoke to reporters in his office, said the commission was not joining issues with anybody in its investigation of the emirate over alleged misappropriation. He added that the commission is acting independently in line with section 8,9 and 15 of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law 2008 (as amended). According to him, the commission is acting on petitions and complaints by concerned citizens over alleged financial misappropriation by Kano Emirate Council under Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II. “This investigation was not commenced at the instance of the  Kano State government, but as a result of a series of complaint by citizens of the state,” he said. He said: “By virtue of Section 8 of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Law 2008 (as amended), which provides that “in exercising its powers under this law,  the commission shall not be subjected to the direction and control of any authority, as such, the commission is not under the control and discretion of any authority or person.”
