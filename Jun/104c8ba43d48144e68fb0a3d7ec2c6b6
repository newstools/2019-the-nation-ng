The conference, which had Strengthening a multi-stakeholder partnership and creating cooperation in curbing illegal migration and human trafficking as its theme was organised by Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF). Mr. Young urged the Federal Government to be tough on the crime and causes of trafficking in the country.
