The Rivers State Police Spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), has stated that the command is not overwhelmed by insecurity in the Niger Delta state. He spoke yesterday through the telephone while assuring residents of the safety of their lives and property. The immediate past Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, who is a former Rivers Governor, while speaking in Port Harcourt, accused his successor, Nyesom Wike, of lack of capacity to govern the volatile state. Amaechi, a chieftain of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), insisted that there was insecurity across the 23 local government areas of Rivers state, especially with penultimate week’s killing of forty innocent persons in a community in the Ogoni axis of the state. Wike, who is one of the leaders of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), however, urged Rivers people and other Nigerians to ignore the “lies” of Amaechi, whom he described as frustrated, stressing that he remained focused, with investors trooping into the state on a daily basis, with the acclaimed improvement on security. Rivers police spokesman said: “The police in Rivers State are doing their best to contain criminal activities. We indeed have pockets of criminal activities in the state, but we are on top of the situation. We are not overwhelmed. “It must be pointed out that insecurity is not peculiar to Rivers State, but we are doing our best to provide adequate security, for more investors to be moving into the state.” Omoni also urged members of the public to continually give useful and timely information to the Rivers command, thereby ensuring the safety of lives and property in the state.
