WORKERS of Kwara State-owned College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies (CAILS) yesterday complained over nonpayment of their salaries from January till date. They blamed the past administrations for their ordeal, saying the former government did not place high premium on education. Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of the college, Musa Mahmud, during a tree planting programme organised by Media Advocacy and Technologies Centre (MATEC) in collaboration with Hajia Mero Mustapha in Ilorin, urged Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq to consider their plight. The event was to commemorate this year’s World Environment Day. Mahmud noted that the state of education in Kwara State from 2003 till date was discouraging. “The presence of government has not been felt in this school since 2003 till date,” he added. He said: “The new All Progressives Congress (APC) government is our own. The current administration is our collective decision. Many of us are not happy. As I am talking to you, I am holding back tears because the last administration turned us into destitute. “We have been living at the mercy of others to survive and keep our children in their schools. We had to go cap in hand to make sure that our children are not sent out of schools as we could not pay school fees. We lived on the mercy of our relatives during the just concluded Ramadan fast. From the beginning of this year we have not earned a kobo as staff of this college.”
