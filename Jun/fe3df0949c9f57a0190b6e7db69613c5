SOME weeks ago, members- elect of the incoming 9th session of the National Assembly held an induction course in Abuja. The purpose was to acquaint them with legislative procedures and ethics. There is no gainsaying the fact that it was a well-attended event. But the high point of the gathering was the dollar rain that greeted it. A senator- elect, who was still a governor at the time, “blessed his fellow senators-elect” with two million dollars! Was it to offset their campaign expenses? Was it to position himself for headship of a juicy committee, post-inauguration? Tough questions. SENTRY, however, learnt that the senators-elect went home satisfied.
