Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Alex Asogwa, popularly known as Alex Unusual, has partnered with The English Manner Nigeria to host a Children’s Etiquette Training event in Lekki, Lagos. The etiquette training held in two batches on May 27 and May 29 respectively for children between the ages of five and 13 years. The English Manner Nigeria, operates under the franchise of The English Manner UK, and the umbrella of The Etiquette Connection, is an international training company offering tutoring in interpersonal, social and business skills, international business diplomacy, cross cultural integration and protocol, household management and cultural tours in Europe, UK, and Asia for a diverse clientele. Children who attended the event were taught about leadership, deportment, problem solving skills, dining etiquette, public speaking and more. Alex revealed that in the course of her etiquette class with the English Manner Nigeria some time back, she saw some children the organization had trained and it dawned on her that so many kids needed the class. “I know it’ll be nice to contribute positively to the proper upbringing of these kids and give them an opportunity to learn what I learnt especially at their young age,” she said. The one-day training at the English Manner Nigeria originally cost N15, 000 but was subsidized to N2,500 to give more children the opportunity to attend the event. Alex further said that there are plans to take the event to the mainland soon so more kids can benefit from it
