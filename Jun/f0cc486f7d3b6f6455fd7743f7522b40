Kidnappers and herdsmen abducting people in some parts of the Southwest have been warned to stop their nefarious activities or risk incurring the wrath of the Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC. Giving the warning in a statement issued in Lagos on Saturday the President, Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, Aare Prince Osibote warned  kidnappers and  herdsmen abducting innocent Nigerians to stop their criminal activities in the Southwest or relocate elsewhere. According to Osibote who succeeded late Dr. Fredrick Faseun as OPC national leader: ”Enough is enough. Yoruba are peace loving and hospitable. We welcome everybody with   open arms , but OPC  will not allow any individual or group to make the Southwest unsafe or  turn Yorubaland into a den of criminals. Time is up for these criminals abducting people. This is the final warning to them, they should stop now, or relocate   elsewhere outside the Southwest. If they fail to do so , they will soon  meet their waterloo”, he declared. Assuring South-West residents not to panic, Osibote said OPC was ready to confront and flush out the kinappers, and herdsmen abducting innocent Nigerians from their hide-outs. ”We are watching the unfolding ugly developments with keen interests. Yoruba and other residents in the Southwest should not panic. We are however calling on the Federal government to quickly address this insecurity problem before it further degenerates. OPC leaders will not watch helplessly or fold their hands  while some criminals are making life difficult  for people, and are behaving as if they are above the law”, he declared. He expressed OPC’s readiness to join hands with government to tackle the insecurity problem.
