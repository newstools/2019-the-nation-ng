Following proscription of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Oyo state, the National President of the union, Alhaji Najeem Yasin on Monday said the National Executive Council of the group will meet with Governor Seyi Makinde, over the development. In a statement from Saudi Arabia where he is performing lesser hajj, Yasin warned members of the union against acting contrary to the proscription order by the governor, saying they should be law-abiding. Makinde had last Friday proscribed activities of NURTW in the state following pockets of violent attacks recorded over leadership tussle rocking the union, which led to the arrest of 29 members of the union by security agencies in the state. The NURTW boss, however, enjoined all the members of the union in the state to remain calm and continue with their lawful business activities despite the embargo placed on the union activities. Yasin noted that the national executive of the union would meet Makinde immediately he (Yasin) returns from Saudi Arabia, adding that the proscription order of the governor on NURTW remains sacrosanct. He enjoined members of the union to allow peace to reign, adding that the union “is known for supporting any government in power and that of Oyo State will not be an exception.” He congratulated Makinde and promised the loyalty of all members of the union to his administration in.
