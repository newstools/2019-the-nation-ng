Some passengers, including the driver of a commercial eighteen- seater bus, were reportedly abducted along Akure/ Ikere Ekiti road by unknown gunmen. It was gathered that the incident happened on Tuesday around 5pm within Iju/Itaogbolu axis. The occupants of the commercial bus were said to be travelling from Akure to Ado-Ekiti before they were waylaid. This incident occurred barely three days after the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigerian Army (NA) Owena Barracks, Akure, launched a high technology drone, a Phantom 5DGI, to fight the scourge of kidnapping and banditry within the Ondo and Ekiti States axis. According to an anonymous source, the kidnappers pointed guns at the bus and ordered the passengers to come out before they were whisked away to an unknown destination. He disclosed the driver would have escaped but the deplorable state of the road hindered him. The leadership of NURTW Ekiti state Chapter confirmed the incident, saying the vehicle involved belongs to a driver popularly known as Ikere. Ekiti State Police Command Spokesman, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu could not be reached as his phone was switched off.
