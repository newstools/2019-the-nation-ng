Idia Aisien, these days, is considered one of the best dressed celebrities in showbiz! She is a super trendsetter who has a great sense of style. Do you want to copy her look! Here is your chance to try her style and get inspired from her look at an event last week.  If you are not making it all the way to the red carpet, that doesn’t mean that you can’t look as good as the dashing leading women. Idia add a bit of flouncy flair wearing a velvety baby pink camisole with lace trimmings and pants suit. She wore her hair in back-swept Nollywood style, complemented her lips with neutral lipstick and shimmering eye shadow. Her rock neutral stilettos sandals, stud earrings and spiral arm bracelet made her really stand out; and she slayed it all with aYves Saint Laurent bag. She’s a real fashionnista!
