The Lagos State Government yesterday reminded the public of the closure of Akanni Doherty Street, Ikeja, between Friday and on Sunday. The closure, is to allow contractors to relocate and interconnect the 700mm diameter public water main in the Ashade vicinity, preparatory to the on-going Nigerian Railway Modernisation Project. “The closure will also be used for excavation across the said road, the laying of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, and backfilling and compaction of the road,” a statement said. It urged motorists to take alternative routes during the period.
