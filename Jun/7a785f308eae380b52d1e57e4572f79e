Operatives of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested a man, Sodiq Rasaq, for allegedly dispossessing a snacks seller of N20,000. In a statement yesterday, RRS said Rasaq was arrested around 5am on Thursday at Ijede Junction in Ikorodu shortly after the incident. He was said to have been aided by Quadri Yusuph to fleece their victim, Ogbodo Chibuike, who they stabbed twice for challenging them. Rasaq was arrested when the victim raised an alarm, which attracted the patrolling RRS men. His alleged accomplice fled. Chibuike told the RRS that  the men stopped him that they wanted to buy puff-puff. He said he did not suspect them since they were about his age. The RRS quoted him as saying: “They bought puff puff of N200. They were to pay me and they refused. I challenged them, they alighted and stabbed me, took my wallet containing N20,000. “I had to call for help when they stabbed me with knife . It was my noise that attracted people. Because they were on Okada, those who came to my aid could not chase them but some RRS officers on patrol chased then. “They caught up with them at Ijede Junction and arrested one of them. The other escaped.” The operatives also arrested Peter Abah, 32, on Mobolaji Johnson Road, Ikeja, who was found with cables concealed inside a wheelbarrow. Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect was released from Badagry Prison last December where he served time for theft of solar panels. He allegedly told detectives that he and two others, at large, cut the cables off from a newly installed transformer. “We were three. We cut the cable from a transformer. We climbed the electric pole before removing the cables from It. I was just unlucky. My colleagues’ names are Godwin and Zuma. “We all connived to cut the upright cables and we knew we could make something out of it to augment our salaries,” he was quoted as telling RRS.
