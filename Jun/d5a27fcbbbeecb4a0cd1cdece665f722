Brands from the Nigerian Breweries portfolio – Gulder, Goldberg and Star Lager – were awarded Gold prizes by Monde Selection Awards. The awards were conferred on the three brands on June 3, at the 58th Annual Awards Ceremony of Monde Selection in Rome, Italy. This year, more than 1,000 companies from 90 countries presented no less than 3,000 products to Monde Selection juries. Each product was evaluated individually to establish its global quality profile and grant the product the quality award it deserves. Gulder, which introduced a new label and packaging last year, Goldberg, the premium quality lager beer brewed to golden standards and Star Lager, the first locally-brewed Nigerian beer, all won Gold Quality Awards at the 2019 Annual Awards Ceremony. It is not the first time NB brands are receiving accolades from respected international organisations. In 2014, Amstel Malta was recognized as an international high quality and prestigious brand with its quality awards from the International Taste and Quality Institute (iTQi) and the Monde Selection Quality Award; while Maltina, Star, and Fayrouz have all been recipients of Advertising Association of Nigeria (ADVAN) Awards for Marketing Excellence respectively at different times.
