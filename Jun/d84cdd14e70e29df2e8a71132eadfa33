Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP),  has reaffirmed the need for improved air quality and soot elimination in Rivers. This is coming as the world commemorates   The global Environment Day. MOSOP President, Mr Legbosi Pyagbara,  told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Port Harcourt  that the theme for the 2019 World Environment Day Celebration “Air Pollution” was timely as it tended to address atmospheric pollution and its inherent danger to mankind. “Rivers government should key into this year’s theme and rise to the challenge of the three-year old soot that has ravaged the entire state with the concentration of impure air particles threatening the health of residents. “It is also needful for the Federal Government,   and the multinational oil companies operating in the Niger Delta to stop gas flaring and save the lives of residents of the region. “The local government and communities should resist illegal artisanal refining of crude oil in our localities,” he said. Pyagbara complained of the continued air pollution in man’s daily life, adding that if not checked it would pose greater danger to humanity. “Air pollution has been reported to be responsible for the death of millions of people every year, among whom are children. “It is estimated that 90 per cent of the world population breath polluted air every five second,” he said.(NAN)
