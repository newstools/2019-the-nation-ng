The 30-minute magazine programme, African Voices, sponsored by the digital transformation leader, Globacom, on the Cable News Network (CNN), this week beams its searchlights on the efforts and achievements of two pilots and a paraglider whose fascinating stories viewers will find inspiring. The latest edition of the programme showing from Friday will profile the trio of David Eris Nguruga, a hot air balloon pilot from Kenya; Tumi Carter Katisi, a commercial pilot from Pimville, Soweto in South Africa and Hans Joachim, a paraglider from Mauritius. Nguruga, who as a child, had the dream of flying airplanes, has lived the dream in the last 12 years romancing with hot air balloons. In the course of the show, the Kenyan nostalgically takes viewers through his trajectory. He said:  “I had developed a liking for flying airplanes when I was a kid. I remember, we were having lunch and this fighter jet came out. I stepped on my food just to see this plane. I was like, ‘whoa’. I said I want to be in one.  So, I think I developed that from my childhood but never thought that I could do it”.  The most interesting part of his story is his growth from being a member of the crew to a pilot.
