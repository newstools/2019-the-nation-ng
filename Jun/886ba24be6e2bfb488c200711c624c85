Properties worth hundreds of millions of naira have been lost in a tanker fire incident in Rivers State at the weekend. The tanker, laden with substance suspected to be diesel, reportedly fell and spilled its contents which gutted fire that spread into people’s properties including businesses and residences, razing them to ashes. The incident reportedly occurred about 11pm Friday night at Rukpokwu Community, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. An eye witness account had it that the tanker lost its balance while the driver was trying to make a U-turn, causing it to fail and spill it’s contents which subsequently burst  into flames and spread as the inflammable substance surged on. Although no life was lost in the incident, it was learnt that help did not come in time to put out the fire, causing everything in the area to go in the flames, said the the source. However the Petroleum Taskforce, has blamed the incident on bad nature of the road and the rickety nature of the vehicle. The Head of Operations, Rivers State Petroleum Tanker Taskforce, Zone E, Kingsley Wahu, who confirmed that the product was AGO, urged tanker drivers to ensure their vehicles are in good condition. He said: “The bad road also contributed to this accident here. Properties worth millions have been damaged here as you can see. “I think there is also need for the tanker drivers to put their truck in good condition. How can this old truck carry over 30 to 50, 000 liters of petroleum?”
