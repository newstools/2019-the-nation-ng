Ahead of the inauguration of the Ninth National Assembly, many governors are backing Femi Gbajabiamila, for the House of Representatives Speaker. Besides, some legislators eying the post have also step down for the legislator from Surulere I Constituency of Lagos State, according to North Central Coordinator, Gbajabiamila for Speaker, Tunji Olawuyi has said. Olawuyi, who is representing Ekiti/Oke-Ero/Isin/Irepodun Federal Constituency of Kwara state, Hon Tunji Olawuyi added that the chances of Hon Femi Gbajabiamila of becoming the speaker of the House of Representatives are brighter. Olawuyi spoke with reporters at the weekend in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, adding that All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party would not make a mistake of what happened in 2015. Said he: “In 2015 our party APC left a lot of things unattended to towards the election of the principal officers of the National Assembly. All of that of that has been put behind us. This time around we are not taking chances. We are in serious business this time around. Most members in 2015 were left untamed. There was no clear-cut instruction from the party. It was like they were left loose, but today our party has spoken. The party has taken a position. I think there is coordination now.” On Gbajabiamila’s chances, the legislator continued: “His chances are bright. The good thing is that we have left no stone unturned. We are so determined for success to come our way. If there is any one in the 8th assembly going to the 9th assembly, no one can be compared to Gbajabiamila. It is like preparing for an examination, if you are going to pass you will know from your preparations.
