Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has been described as a competent and commendable choice to lead the lower chamber. According to the chairman, Surulere Local Government Area, Tajudeen Ajide, Gbajabiamila has made Surulere proud. Gbajabiamila, representing Surulere I federal constituency in Lagos,  emerged the 9th Speaker of the Federal House of Rep by flooring his main challenger who represents Chanchaga Federal Constituency, Umar Mohammed Bago. The chairman, in a statement made available to The Nation, said: “Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, is a competent and commendable choice given his robust legislative experience and constructive contributions at plenary and on national discourses. “Also, I felicitate with our toiling party members and voters in Surulere Federal Constituency I on this shared glory.” Ajide also hailed Senator Oluremi Tinubu, saying her return as the representative of Lagos Central Senatorial district was reward for quality representation of her constituents. He further said: “No doubt, Nigerians eagerly await more democracy dividends from the federal government based on their hope of a greater accord between the executive and the newly inaugurated 9th national assembly. “Apparently, President Muhammadu Buhari’s “Next Level” agenda is achievable with the present arrangement. I equally congratulate the president and our leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, for their efforts at this critical juncture of Nigeria’s democracy.”
