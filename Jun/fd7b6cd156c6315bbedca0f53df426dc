Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) has said that he is innocent of the rape allegations leveled against him by Busola Dakolo saying that has never been involved in rape. Busola, wife of a popular Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, had in an interview, accused the pastor of abusing her at age 16. However, Fatoyinbo via a public statement debunked the allegation stating that even as an unbeliever, he never raped a woman. He said, “I have NEVER RAPED before, not even as an unbeliever!”
