Former Head of State General Yakubu Gowon has said the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has stood the test of time, 46 years after it was created. The Gowon administration created the NYSC to heal the wounds the nation suffered at the end of Nigeria’s civil war which lasted for three months. Gowon said the scheme had instilled the spirit of selfless service in successive batches of corps members who participated in the service across the country. The former Head of State spoke when the Director-General of NYSC, Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, visited him in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Gowon hailed the Federal Government for granting automatic employment and scholarship to 168 recipients of the NYSC President’s Honours Award recipients. He lauded the involvement of the scheme in this year’s general elections and urged NYSC workers to sustain the scheme. Gowon appealed to state governments to provide and maintain facilities at the NYSC Orientation Camps. The ex-Head of State also praised the management of the NYSC for mentoring graduates towards becoming responsible leaders in the society. He congratulated the corps members for their selfless services to the country through the scheme, saying it had exposed them to the diverse cultures across Nigeria.
