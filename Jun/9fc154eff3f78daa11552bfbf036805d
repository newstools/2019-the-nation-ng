THE senator representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice, has hailed the ruling of the Federal High Court sitting in Akure which affirmed the mandate of the federal lawmaker representing Akoko South East/South West Federal Constituency, Hon. Ade Adeogun. In a press statement issued yesterday by his media adviser, Kayode Fakuyi, the senator said the ruling is in consonant with the wishes of the people, while felicitating with Adeogun. He said: “The ruling derived inspirations from provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution (As Amended), the Electoral Act and previous rulings of Supreme Court that are plain and unambiguous. “Thus, there is no need to test the ruling in higher courts because no court will depart from such constitutional framework.” Boroffice urged the promoters of the case to sheathe their swords and embrace peace in the interest of the party and the people. The senator also congratulated the people of Akoko South East/South West federal constituency while urging them to keep faith with the All Progressives Congress (APC) for unprecedented delivery of good governance and humane leadership
