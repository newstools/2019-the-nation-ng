Her masked attackers reportedly entered her house at 10B Olorunsogo Street, Odojomu, Ondo State, around 7 p.m last Wednesday. They assailants were said to have demanded to see her husband, who was not at home. Mrs Adeyemi said she was beaten up and tied with a rope in her bedroom and the apartment set ablaze. The hoodlums ran away when she started shouting for help. “I was rescued by our neighbours before the arrival of fire fighters,” she said. Mrs Adeyemi recalled that the family was attacked by robbers last December 25. She urged the Ondo State Police Command to tackle insecurity in Odojomu.
