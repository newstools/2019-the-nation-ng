Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has called on leaders at all levels of governance to redouble their efforts in ensuring that the people get the real value of democracy. Ikpeazu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, to mark Democracy Day, praised Nigerians for showing “unprecedented commitment and faith in the country’s democratic process in the last 20 years”. The governor restated his administration’s commitment to ensuring that Abians felt the presence of governance in their locality. Ikpeazu, who praised the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji, and his deputy Ifeanyi Uchendu for their victory, reminded them that Abians have high expectations from political leaders. The governor promised that in the coming weeks and months, the people will witness renewed vigour and single mindedness in the running of the state through the strengthening of democratic institutions, in addition to the deliberate pursuit of those policies that will make the state safer, economy stronger and people happier. The statement reads: “This year’s celebration is special, being the first to be held on June 12, in commemoration of the day Nigerians expressed their democratic choice, devoid of tribal and ethno-religious sentiments in 1993. “That election and the subsequent chain of events that followed it set the tone for the birth of the current democracy we have enjoyed uninterruptedly as a nation since 1999. “Governor Ikpeazu salutes President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, and all Nigerians, on this auspicious occasion coming soon after the start of this current democratic dispensation. “Nigerians have shown unprecedented commitment and faith in our democracy, and have demonstrated in the clearest of terms that a government of the people, by the people and for the people remains the best form of government.”
