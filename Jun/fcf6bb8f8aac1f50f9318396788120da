The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has joined the Secure Identity Alliance (SIA), as advisory observer. SIA is the global identity and secure digital services advisory body, which promotes legal, trusted identity for all. Making the announcement today (Monday), the organisation named the Director-General/CEO of NIMC, Aliyu Aziz as the Chair of the Advisory Committee of the Open Standards Identity API (OSIA) initiative, in his capacity as an advisory observer and the representative of NIMC. The meeting is SIA’s ground-breaking global programme that set the standards guarding against vendor lock-in for technologies and solutions used by government agencies worldwide in the implementation of their identity programmes. The organisation explained that by allowing governments to exert  control over their national identity programmes, the OSIA initiative provides the standardised data formats and open interfaces that eliminate the interoperability challenges, which all too frequently hamper the evolution of national Identity systems.
