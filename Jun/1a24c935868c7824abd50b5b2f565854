In a remark, Ilorin zonal head of the commission, Isyaku Sharu said “our duty does not end in arresting and prosecuting people, we are changing lives for good, and we must look at preventive mechanism. According to Mr. Sharu “Fighting corruption is not a one man’s business, it is a collective responsibility, we collect information from members of the public. Information is key, intelligence is key, you relate with the lowest, middle and highest, so you get information, I appeal to you to partner with the EFCC in the ongoing fight against corruption.”
