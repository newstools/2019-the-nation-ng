Other awardees at the event which was staged in Katsina yesterday included AFDIN Group of Companies, Alhaji Dahiru Mangal and Chairman, State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Lawal Buhari Daura. Speaking shortly after receiving the award, the governor thanked the organisers, saying the honour had affirmed that his performance in governance has truly alleviated the plight of the citizens. He said, ”We are here for service delivery and doing what we are supposed to do. Providing leadership in difficult times is always a challenging one; we are determined to tackle insecurity, economic and political challenges as well as implementing polices that will enhance both the state and the nation.” He further solicited the support and cooperation of the citizenry and security agencies to tackle security challenges in the state, adding that “Security is everyone’s business, so all hands must be on deck to address the challenge.” The Country Coordinator of Citizen’s Right and Leadership Awareness Initiative, Ambassador Oladipo Musibau, while presenting the award to Masari and other recipients, said the governor has, in the last four years, worked tirelessly to turn Katsina State into a smart city. “Selecting Governor Masari for the award was easy as his track records of exemplary performance towered above his peers.
