The 60th anniversary of the Mount Shiloh Praying Band of the Holy Cherubim and Seraphim (INC.), a member of United Aladura churches, begins today with a Praise Night. It will continue on Sunday with a remembrance service. The anniversary thanksgiving service will hold tomorrow, June 29, the exact day the church was founded 60 years ago. The host, Baba Aladura H.B Philips said God will take his people to Rehoboth, which is the theme of the anniversary, taken from Genesis 26:22.
