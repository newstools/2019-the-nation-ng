The Ikoyi-Obalende Local Council Development Area (LCDA) has inaugurated a Primary Health Care Centre (PHC) named in honour of Senator Oluremi Tinubu. The PHC in the Ijeh area of Dolphin, Lagos, was opened by Prince Tajudeen Oluyole Olusi. The council chairman, Fuad Atanda-Lawal said the senator was honoured because of her humanitarian gestures. “This facility is named after a Godly, tireless, selfless, hardworking humanitarian, who has spent the better part of her life working to better the lot of humanity. Senator Tinubu has dedicated her life to sustainable humanitarian projects,” he said. According to him, the centre will run for 24 hours daily. Atanda-Lawal said he is committed to providing qualitative care always. “This centre has a fully functional integrated maternity centre with state-of-the-art equipment and experienced hands to ensure our women can give birth with ease. Wards are retrofitted and doctors are always on call to attend to patients. A fully-equipped ambulance is on ground . There is a standby generator to complement electricity supply. The laboratory is equipped for various tests and a pharmacy shop to ensure original drugs are dispensed in line with government’s regulations,” he said. Senator Tinubu thanked the council for the honouring. She said she understood the plight of the people, adding that the PHC fits into their needs. “The influx of patients into our secondary and tertiary health facilities has led to overburdening of available resources. The impact of this PHC is that it will reduce the burden. This facility I was told will provide members of the community access to comprehensive health care. Health is wealth and a healthy nation is a wealthy nation,” she said. According to her, the people of lkoyi -Obalende are enjoying the dividends of democracy because they voted for the All Progressives Congress (APC).
