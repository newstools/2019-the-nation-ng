A 21-year-old bride, Fatima Musa, has allegedly attempted to kill her husband, Saheed Husaini, by stabbing him in the abdomen over a misunderstanding. Fatima, a Law student of Bayero University, Kano (BUK), allegedly committed the offence at 1.30 a.m on Saturday at their Ungwar Mai Kalwa, Naibawa Quarters home in Kumbotso Local Government Area of Kano State. It was learnt that Fatima suspected that her husband was communicating with other women on his phone. An eyewitness said it was the cry for help from Saheed that woke him and other neighbours. He said the neighbours found Saheed as he held his stomach while he bled. Saheed, a worker of Federal University, Gusau, Zamfara State, was conveyed to Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) where he is receiving treatment. He was still unconscious on Sunday. A source told The Nation that the seven-month marriage had been having hiccups as Fatima reportedly said on many occasions that she did not love Saheed but for the insistence of her mother. “Fatima has allegedly attempted poisoning him thrice, believing if she achieved that aim, she would be free,” the source said. “It’s a known secret to most of us that know them that Fatima uses drug, and she does not hide it,” the source added It was learnt that on the day the incident happened, Saheed beat her up and she sustained injuries in the process. The Nation was also informed that Fatima was also on admission in the hospital. She is said to be pregnant. Her father declined to comment on the comment as he stayed by her at the AKTH. Police spokesman Abdullahi Haruna, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said Fatima had been arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
