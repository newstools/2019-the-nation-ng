 Super Eagles of Nigeria and Warriors of Zimbabwe Saturday at the Stephen Keshi Stadium settled for a goalless draw in one of the shape up matches ahead of the Nations cup in Egypt. Both teams qualified for the continental fiesta and were impressive but cautious in the friendly tie that saw many fans troop out to watch defying the heavy down pour in Asaba. Although the Eagles especially in the early minutes of match attempted to rattle the Warriors, the visitors held their ground proving that indeed their qualification was no fluke. Coach Gernot Rohr had prior to the match declared that it was not about winning or losing but using the match to see to the readiness of the boys he is taking to the land of the Pharaohs. He had also said that players who were a bit rusty in their clubs will be given opportunity to play and prove themselves. One of the players some had looked forward to playing in the match was Leicester City forward Kelechi Iheanacho who unfortunately did not play.Â  But team Captain John Obi Mikel was in superlative form leaving no one in doubt that he is ready to lead the squad to yet another Nations cup. Rohr is expected to drop two players from his current 25-man squad in camp before heading to Egypt where the team will play the last friendly against Taranga Lions of Senegal before diving into the competition proper. The Warriors of Zimbabwe will battle host Egypt, Uganda and DR Congo in the group Stage, while the Eagles have dates against Guinea and two tournament debutants Burundi and Madagascar. The warriors will open shop against hosts Egypt on June 21 in Cairo while the Eagles will begin their quest against Burundi June 22 in Alexandria.
