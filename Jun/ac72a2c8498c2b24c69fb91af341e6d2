Condemnations are trailing calls by Ohanaeze Ndigbo for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari for attending the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) meeting. Buhari left for Saudi Arabia a day after his inauguration to attend the OIC meeting and this drew the ire of Ohanaeze. A statement by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Chuks Ibegu, accused Buhari of being a “religious fanatic”, and called on him to resign. But leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide said it was amazed by the call for President Buhari to resign. The group said it is “idiotic and barbaric” for anyone to call for the President’s resignation using Igbo platform. A statement by the President-General said such rhetoric could plunge the country into a religious war that will consume the country especially, Igbo living in the North. The statement reads: “We disassociate ourselves from any call for the resignation of President Buhari few days after his swearing in, and urge those behind it to have a rethink and stop using Igbo platform for personal vendetta against the Presidency. “We should be forming alliances and building bridges across the Niger, rather than creating enmity with predominantly Northern Muslims by calling on President Buhari’s resignation on religious grounds. “We call on Vice President Yemi Osibanjo to douse all fears that could heat up the polity unnecessarily by summoning the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to assure the Christian community that in a secular country like Nigeria, everyone is protected. He should also ensure that Mr. President’s Islamic believes are not misunderstood.”
