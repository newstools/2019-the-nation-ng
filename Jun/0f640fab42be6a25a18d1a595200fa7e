Kano state Complaints and Anti- Corruption Commission has said there is no court order stopping it from investigating alleged mismanaging of Kano Emirate Fund. The Commission said although there is a court order issued restraining it from executing a warrant of arrest on three Emirate Council staff and it is obeying by maintaining status quo. This was contained in a statement issued by the Commission Chairman, Muhuyi Magaji Rimi gado on Monday. The statement said the Commission as a law abiding organization will always operate within the ambit of law and respect court orders.
