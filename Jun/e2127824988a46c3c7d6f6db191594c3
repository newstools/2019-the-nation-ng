ON Air Personality, Denrele Edun, who turned 38 last week, has said there is no limit to what he can accomplish in life. Denrele, who recently opened a club in Bayelsa State said that everything that has happened has made him happy. “Sometimes, being different feels a lot like being alone,” he said. “But with that being said, being TRUE to that and being TRUE to my standards and my way of doing things in my ART and my CRAFT, Everything that has made me feel very different…in the end, it has made me the HAPPIEST! “As I step into my 38th year, I hope to continue practicing compassion for MYSELF first, knowing that it is the only way I can give it to anyone else. I also want to take with me into my 38th year, an exhale of TRUST that I can continue to have the power to ground and center myself. And that through this grounding, there will be a faith and fearlessness that will arise and fortify me in doing the work I am meant to do.”
