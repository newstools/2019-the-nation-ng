According to Kaigama, they were in Lalong’s office to pray for him in compliance with scriptural injunctions that they should pray for leaders since all authorities come from God. His Lordship cautioned Lalong to guide against divisive factors that breed mistrust, hatred, violence, insecurity, polarisation and tension as he strives to deliver on his electoral mandate.
