Ahead of the November 16, Kogi State governorship election, two leading aspirants of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), Prince Yahaya Audu and Admiral Usman Jibril (rtd.) have received support. While some political appointees in the cabinet of Governor Yahaya Bello have purportedly dumped the latter to team up with Audu, youths from the Dekina/Bassa axis have endorsed the aspiration of the former Chief of Naval Staff. Those that have aligned with Audu include some serving commissioners and Bello’s aides, who are said to have endorsed him as their sole candidate for governorship. According to the Bassa/Dekina youths led by Hon. Mohammed Abdullahi, Jubril has the wherewithal to take Kogi to the ‘Next Level’. “Those in position of authority over the years could not salvage our lands from the status of backwardness and underdevelopment. It is on this assertion that we, the youths of Dekina/Bassa LG deem it necessary to support Admiral Usman Jibril for governorship of Kogi State, in view of his immense contribution to the people. “We believe he will fulfill our yearning and attend to the needs of our people. We therefore want to usher him as our sole candidate for the job,” they said.
