The Presidency on Tuesday welcomed the endorsement of 2019 Presidential Elections as free, fair and credible by 60 presidential candidates and chairmen of their parties. President Muhammadu Buhari had won the election ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party candidate and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The opposition party had headed to court over the matter. But the Presidency on Tuesday urged the opposition to accept the loss with grace and maturity. It was reacting to the press conference of the Joint Forum. The Presidency had assured that President Buhari would look into the Electoral Act as the candidates had advised. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, reads “We are encouraged by the patriotism of the Presidential Candidates expressed in clear and matured language. We are convinced that, regardless of our different political persuasions we can work together to improve electoral integrity in Nigeria,’’ The Presidency said it is in agreement with the Joint Forum that “despite the temporary setbacks experienced at the beginning, INEC managed to produce an election in which the voice of the ordinary people counted. Democracy is founded on the will of the people and INEC did well to ensure this outcome was achieved in the 2019 elections.’’ The Presidency restated that “the success of democracy does not only depend on electoral laws, but also on behaviour, character and attitude of politicians.’’ The Presidency reiterated that “do-or-die politics is a threat to the success of electoral laws and democracy. And you don’t need to kill in order to serve the people.’’ The Presidency assured members of the joint forum of the 60 political parties and chairmen of parties that the President will not spare any effort in signing the Electoral Act into law after looking into it.
