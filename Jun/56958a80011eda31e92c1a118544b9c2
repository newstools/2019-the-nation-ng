MEMBER representing Oshodi/Isolo constituency 2 at Lagos House of Assembly, Jude Idimogu, has said lawmakers are ready to stick their necks for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to move Lagos forward and bring out the real vision of Lagos State. Speaking at the Lagos State House Assembly complex, Alausa, recently, the former PDP member, who returned to the 9th Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is no doubt having confidence in the elected governor to move the train of the state to a greater height. “The governor has a lot to do in the state and everybody must be ready to work with him. The House is having confidence in the governor and we have no doubt about his competence, which has given us the confidence that Lagos will work again,” said the lawmaker, who happens to be the only Igbo man in the Lagos State House of Assembly. “For the people living the state, I will like to urge them to be law abiding citizens and cooperate with this government for the benefit of everybody.” The Imo State-born Lagos lawmaker said he appreciates the support of his constituency having left PDP to APC for the purpose of benefiting in the dividends of democracy. “I was elected by the people in my constituency because of the trust and interest I have shown to serve them, so it’s my duty to return back the goodwill to them by listening to their needs and move a motion to benefit the constituency. I can assure that all the bad roads will be attended to, a lot of things will come up and that’s the progressives we are talking about.”
