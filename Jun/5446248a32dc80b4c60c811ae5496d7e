The Ogun State government, on Friday, set up a committee to review the appointment, installation and promotion of traditional rulers in the state, carried out by the out-gone governor, Ibikunle Amosun, in the twilight of his administration. A total of 75 people were appointed and installed as coronet Obas by Amosun across  the state and this has continued to elicit condemnation, even from the state’s House of Assembly, which passed a resolution suspending the installed monarchs on the grounds that their appointment didn’t follow due process. Foremost businessman, kingmaker and politician, High Chief Alani Bankole, for instance, condemned Amosun’s installation of the 75 Obas in one swoop, describing the action as “pure madness.” He said, that, a governor is not elected to disrupt the social and cultural system of a people, lamenting that even in a community where the residents were less than 200, Amosun, allegedly, appointed an Oba there, wondering the rationale behind such decision. Bankole, who is the father of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, noted that as a kingmaker, he has a duty to promote, protect and defend the sanctity and sacredness of the culture and traditions of Egba people, added that the incident was an abnormality. However, in a statement by the newly appointed Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, and made available to The Nation, the state government stated that the Review Committee comprises His Royal Majesty Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, Olu of Ilaro and Paramount Ruler of Yewaland (chairman); His Royal Highness, Oba Yinusa Adekoya, the Dagburewe of Idowa; His Royal Highness, Oba Adewale Osiberu, the Elepe of Epe, Sagamu; High Chief Yinka Kufile, the Aro of Egbaland; Babajide Oyeti, former Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs; and Lanre Osota, the current Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, who will serve as the secretary to the committee. The Committee’s Terms of Reference are to identify all the Obas and Chiefs whose appointments or promotions fall within the review period as contained in the recent resolution of the Ogun State House of Assembly and determine on a case-by-case basis, whether such appointment or promotion is in accordance with due process and extant laws of Ogun State. Others are to identify and address any other issue that the committee may consider relevant to its assignments and make appropriate recommendations as deemed necessary to the government.
