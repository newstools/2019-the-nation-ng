KeIechi Iheanacho will have a full pre-season with Leicester City after he failed to make the final cut for Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations squad. The 22-year-old striker is one of two players, along with Rotherham’s Semi Ajayi, to have been left out by Super Eagles boss Gernot Rohr, who has reduced his provisional squad to 23 players for the tournament in Egypt later this month. Iheanacho’s City team-mate Wilfred Ndidi is in the squad and is expected to be a starter for Nigeria. Iheanacho was criticised by his international coach when he was dropped in March, but he returned to the squad this summer. Rohr has since praised the improvement in the striker’s professionalism, but Iheanacho has failed to win over the German manager fully, with his goal drought, extending back to September, affecting his confidence.
