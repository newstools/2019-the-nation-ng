A clergy, Prophet Ade Ologbonyo, has urged churches to support President Muhammadu Buhari in prayers to tackle the twin evils of banditry and kidnappings. Prophet Ologbonyo, founder of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Mercy Land, Orun-Ekiti, Ekiti State, gave the admonition during the church’s 10th anniversary and ground breaking of the 5,000-capacity ultramodern church auditorium. The foundation laying was performed by the CAC District Coordinating Superintendent, Agege, Pastor Olu Eyebiokin, on behalf of the CAC General Evangelist, Prophet Hezekiah Oladeji. The ceremony was graced by dignitaries like Lady Evangelist Bola Aare and Bisi Alawiye. Prophet Ologbonyo said the church, which begun with 20 worshippers in his sitting room, had grown in leaps and bounds, with branches in different states. He, therefore, admonished his congregation not to waiver in their trust in God and do everything within their capacity to promote the work of God. The cleric said everybody must work to tackle insecurity. He said: “As men of God, I think we are duty-bound to intensify our prayers for Nigeria and her leaders to get out of the prevailing challenges. What is happening in Nigeria today remains a source of concern and worry to all. “The spate of insecurity has reached an alarming proportion, as we all live in perpetual fear. Nobody can sleep with the eyes closed. “Even in our community there is palpable fear everywhere. In fact, it got a point that I joined in the night security surveillance. At times I used to visit as many as 15 communities to assure them and give them hope. “The challenges confronting Nigeria is multi-faceted. Today, there is no job for our youths, the hospitals are in bad shape, and the roads are also bad.”
