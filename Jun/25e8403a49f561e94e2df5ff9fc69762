Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Tecno is committed to empowering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the country. Speaking during the presentation of cheques to winners in Light Up Your Dream 3 in Lagos at the weekend, it said it is determined to ensure that youths with dreams get their dreams realised by offering them financial assistance. The contest, which started in April is part of the Tecno Spark 3 launch. It brought young  entrepreneurs with various business interests ranging from agriculture to technology, sharing their business dreams with the hope of winning the N1million prize money. After a rigorous exercise, nine pitched their ideas to a panel of judges that included the CEO of 360 Group, Noble Igwe and Nollywood actress, Juliana Olayode, popularly known as Toyo Baby. PR and Strategic Partnership Manger, Tecno Nigeria, Jesse Oguntimehin, said although the initiative was an experiment the brand decided to carry out, over the years, it has been a huge success. He also said the initiative was conceived with the intention of ‘making a positive impact on the different local communities in the country by empowering budding entrepreneurs to achieve their life-long dreams because Tecno really is for Nigerians. At the end of the pitching, two winners were selected based on their communication skills, creativity, and business acumen. The two winners, Amaka Judith, a shoemaker and Mercy Orlu, a soap maker, went away with N1 million each.
