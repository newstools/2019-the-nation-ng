Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Edo State, Barr. Anselm Ojezua, has declared calls for Governor Godwin Obaseki to share state funds to few politicians as embarrassing. He insisted the chapter should rather work towards strengthening its structures ahead of the 2020 gubernatorial elections in the state. Ojezua made the call while addressing journalists at Government House, Benin City after a closed-door meeting between leaders of the party and Governor Godwin Obaseki. He said what members of the APC in Edo State needed was a rethink on how to re-position the party to continue to deliver dividends of democracy and finalise preparations for 2020 governorship election. Ojezua said the APC is still intact despite agitations from a handful of its members opposed to the governor’s refusal to share funds meant for development of the state to them. According to him: “This is the first time in all my years in politics that I am seeing politicians come out openly to complain about money and seek reward for political supremacy. “What you ought to hear politicians talk about in public should be how to ensure that roads and schools are provided for their communities and other things that will impact their areas. I am very embarrassed by the act “We are carrying out a review of the last general elections and decisions reached would soon be made public.” He said the meeting heard the governor’s perspective of happenings within the state chapter’s structure. Obaseki said it was too early to raise issues regarding the 2020 gubernatorial elections in the state, noting, “It is a deliberate attempt to distract this administration because they are shocked by the progress of work done and the acceptance of the governor by our people.” He said the meeting has reassured him the administration was on the right track and needed deepening of reforms across different sectors of the state’s economy.
