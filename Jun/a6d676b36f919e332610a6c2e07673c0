The crisis rocking the Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has deepened as the party in different congresses produced two factional chairmen. The Dr. Alex Otti-led faction is chaired by Nkem Okoro while the Uchenna Okogbuo-led group returned its immediate past Chairman, Rev. Augustine Ehiemere, as substantive chairman. Okoro, at a news conference, affirmed the executive’s loyalty to Otti, the 2019 governorship candidate, who they recognised as the party leader in the state. He accused the Ehiemere group of allowing themselves to be bought over by the government, “yielding themselves as tools to destabilise the party”, and vowed that his administration will work closely with Otti to reclaim his mandate. Other members of the executive council include Elvis Nwagbara (Deputy Chairman); Kalu Okpo Kalu (Vice Chairman Abia North); Pino Nwagboso (Vice Chairman Abia South); Evang. Innocent Okamgba (Vice Chairman Abia Central); Onyebuchi Onyegbule (State Secretary); Finbarrs Ukaegbu (Asst. State Secretary); Maureen Okonkwo (State Treasurer).
