President Muhammadu Buhari has waded into the crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress over next year’s governorship election. Some members of the APC under the auspices of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) have vowed to stop Governor Obaseki from securing the party’s ticket to run for the election. The EPM members who claim to be loyalists of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole accused Governor Obaseki of alienating those that brought him to power and destruction of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole’s legacies. But Governor Obaseki, in several fora, said those against his second term bid were few politicians he refused to give government money to. Sources however told our reporter that President Buhari waded into the crisis by calling for a truce between Governor Obaseki and Oshiomhole. The source said Governor Obaseki was at the villa on Friday to brief the President about his 2020 ambition and those opposing him. According to the source who asked not to be named, the President asked Obaseki to meet with his predecessor, Oshiomhole and he got them talking. It was learnt that the intervention of Buhari made a meeting between Oshiomhole and Obaseki to be held in Abuja in the presence of some top personalities and party chieftains. According to the source, “Last night, President Buhari got Oshiomhole and Obaseki talking. This is the same Obaseki that said he can never see Oshiomhole. “He is now stretching the olive branch but his aides are not sincere with him. Oshiomhole remained a constant equation in the whole arrangement. He has never spoken about Edo 2020.”
