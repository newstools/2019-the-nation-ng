A commercial motorcycle operator was on Wednesday crushed to death in Ado-Ekiti by a motorist after he allegedly refused to stop when the traffic light was on red. The accident occurred at about 10:38a.m. under the flyover at Okesa on Olukayode Stadium. It caused pandemonium around the area with sympathisers clustering in groups at the accident spot. It was gathered that the body had been deposited at the mortuary of Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), Ado-Ekiti. When reporters visited the spot, the  skull of the deceased was shattered and the blood splashed on the Spacewagon with the plate number FF 188 APP that killed him. A police officer, who was stationed at the traffic light to control vehicular movement but craved anonymity, said the commercial motorcycle operator was crushed by the space wagon after riding against traffic light. The accident led to a multiple head-on collision that caused a traffic jam on Okesa-Fajuyi road, as the car swerved off the road and hit a truck at the rear. The traffic officer: “The man that was driving the car had already moved and unexpectedly, the motorcyclist rode onto the road and was hit by the car and he was killed. “We rushed there to save him, but he died instantly and the body was taken to the mortuary.” A witness told reporters that the driver of the Spacewagon fled the scene upon realising that the motorcyclist had died.
