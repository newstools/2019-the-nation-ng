The Special Presidential  Investigation Panel  (SPIP) for Recovery of Public Property has transferred to the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation (DPPF) the prosecution of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi (Delta North) for  alleged failure to declare his assets. In a letter accompanying the case file, dated June 7, 2019 and signed by Dr. Celcius Ukpong of the panel office, the SPIP said it forwarded the case to the DPPF for further handling in furtherance of the inter-agency and collaborative efforts of Federal Government’s agencies involved in the anti-corruption war. The letter reads: “I am directed to forward to you above named case file for further action. The above suspect is under investigation before us for possession of suspicious assets far and beyond his legitimate earnings. “He has refused to declare his assets before the panel after lawful demand by the special presidential investigation panel. “This refusal is contrary to and punishable under section 3(i)(a) of the Recovery of Public Property (Special Provisions) Act 2004. “It shall be appreciated if a charge is brought against him for this offence pending the conclusion of the investigation. “We hereby attach a draft charge against him, for your perusal and further action, please.” The letter also had Index to Case File, Extract From Case Diary, Investigation Activities and Interim Investigation report attached for the DPPF action. The panel, last week, forwarded to the Code of Conduct Bureau for further investigation the case file of Senator Nwaoboshi.
