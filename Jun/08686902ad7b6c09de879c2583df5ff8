THE Ondo State All Progressives Congress Youth League is canvassing support for Senator Ahmed Lawan (Yobe North) and Senator Ajayi Boroffice (Ondo North) for Senate President and Deputy Senate President, ahead of tomorrow’s inauguration at the National Assembly. The group sought the support of senators to pave way for the two ranking senators to lead the ninth Senate. In a statement issued by its coordinator, Comrade Tosin Lawal, the group described Senators Lawan and  Boroffice as “progressive perfect combination to mobilise legislative support for the policies and programmes of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration towards the actualisation of the next level agenda”. “Among other reasons, we decided to publicly canvass for the emergence of Lawan as Senate President and  Boroffice as Deputy Senate President because they are foundation members of the APC. “They understand the policies and programmes of the APC-led administration. They are trusted, loyal and committed members of the party. The progressive pairing will reduce rancour between the executive and legislative arms of government. They are most suitable for the Senate leadership. “Out of the contenders for the position of Deputy Senate President, Senator Boroffice is the best. His personality exemplifies the capacity, maturity and temperament needed to lead the Senate in the capacity of Deputy Senate President. He is a patriotic Nigerian with fecund legislative experience. He is a loyal party man.”
