THROUGH its Mission in Nigeria, the United States (U.S) has denied reports that it has placed an indefinite ban on student visa for Nigerians. The unconfirmed report, which has been trending on social media, said the U.S. was targeting countries whose citizens overstay during their visit. But the US Mission denied the report and described it as fake news. It issued the denial via its official Twitter handle. “#FakeNews Alert! Be advised, reports of Student Visa ban for Nigerians is false. If you have seen such manufactured item on Facebook and Twitter or received it via WhatsApp, please communicate that it is false,” the US said. In March, Nigeria was listed among the countries which President Donald Trump mulled to impose travel restrictions on. Immigrants overstaying their visas at relatively high rates was among the reasons Nigeria was included in the category. Two months later, the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria suspended drop box service or interview waiver for those renewing visas in the country. Prior to the policy change, it was possible for Nigerians who were renewing their existing or expired visa to apply for a renewal online, via the visa drop box service. But the U.S. has said it does not enjoy denying Nigerians visa.
