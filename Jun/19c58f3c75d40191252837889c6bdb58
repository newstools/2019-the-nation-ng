The Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) policies on financial inclusion, including planned take-off of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) and impact of mobile money, are expected to deepen financial penetration by taking banking to the grassroots. A report released by Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) shows how some states and regions stand on the financial inclusion chart and what should be done to raise their performances, writes COLLINS NWEZE. Nigeria’s hope of achieving 80 per cent financial inclusion rate come the year 2020 is alive. The plan received a major boost with the latest figure from the Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) 2018 survey showing that 2.6 million more people have embraced financial services. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) policies on mobile money, agency banking, Know Your Customer (KYC), insurance, and recently, Payment Service Banks (PSBs), expected to takeoff this year have helped to deepen financial penetration. Not long ago, the CBN berthed the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), which seeks to ensure that over 80 per cent bankable adults in Nigeria have access to financial service by 2020. In addition to what the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and other financial institutions have been doing, the CBN has cleared the way to license a new set of operators referred to as PSBs. The EFInA survey The EFInA survey showed that 63.6 per cent of Nigeria’s adult population now has access to financial services and only 36.6 per cent are now financially excluded. EFInA is a non-governmental organisation and a financial sector development organisation funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation towards promoting financial inclusion in Nigeria. The firm conducts surveys every two years in order to determine the situation of things regarding financial inclusion in the country. Regionally, the Southwest and Southeast, two zones with the least financial exclusion rate in the past, had underperformed in the last two years. The zones recorded exclusion rate of 18 per cent and 28 per cent respectively in 2016, compared with 19 per cent and 29 per cent exclusion rate, respectively in 2018. All the other zones, however, recorded significant decrease in exclusion rate in the last two years with the Southsouth zone improving from 31 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent in 2018, and the Northcentral achieving 31per cent in 2018 from 39 per cent in 2016. Northeast and Northwest scored 55 per cent in 2018 from 62 per cent in 2016 and 62 per cent in 2018 from 70 per cent in 216, respectively. The regional breakdown shows that Kano, Jigawa and Katsina states in the Northwest Zone failed to achieve the region’s average of 62.4 per cent, with Kano having the highest exclusion rate of 75.2 per cent. Gombe, Bauchi and Yobe states fell below the average in the Northeast region (54.5 per cent). Gombe for example, had the highest exclusion rate of 76.1 per cent, Bauchi 60.8 per cent and Yobe 60.0 per cent. Taraba had the least exclusion rate of 30.9 per cent in the region. In the Southeast zone, Ebonyi emerged the only state that failed to achieve an exclusion rate below the average of 29.3 per cent. The state recorded a financial exclusion rate of 43.6 per cent. In the Southsouth zone, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom and Edo states had an exclusion rate more than the average in that zone (22.7 per cent). The states had 35.3 per cent, 29.1 per cent and 25.4 per cent. The EFInA’s 2018 report came after a painstaking research carried out across the country, with 750 respondents in each of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and 27,470 interviews, which represents 97 per cent of the target samples of 28,380. The survey was anchored on several indicators, including banked population, remittances, savings with a bank, payments, received income, loan with a bank, and banking agents, among others. An increase of 1.4 per cent in the banked population from the 2016 to 2018 was found, a decrease of 2.2 per cent in remittances between in two years, and another decrease of 6.7 per cent in savings with a bank within the period. The indicators of payments received income and banking agents all recorded increases of 3.4 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively, while loan with a bank remained static at 1.3 per cent. The report, however, found a decrease of 1.6 per cent (from 30.1 per cent in 2016 to 28.5 per cent to 2018) in the non-bank indicators of Pension; Savings through other formal institutions; mobile money; mobile money agents; Insurance; Remittances; and loans with other formal institutions. Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility Before the release of the EFInA report, financial inclusion report on Nigeria showed that Northeast and Southeast regions have the least access to banking, a report on financial access touch-points released on Monday has shown. With five per cent financial access touch-points for the Northeast and seven per cent for the Southeast, both regions remain disadvantaged in access to financial services despite efforts by the CBN, Bankers’ Committee and commercial banks to take banking to the grassroots, the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) report has shown. The CBN voted N20 billion for banks, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement Systems (NIBSS), licensed Mobile Money Operators and Shared Agents to accelerate financial inclusion and take banking to more Nigerians. A SANEF Technical Committee member, Bolaji Lawal, said the SANEF initiative involves on-boarding 40 million low income and un-served Nigerians into the financial system, increasing financial access points from the current 50,000 to 500,000 by 2020 and deepening access to mobile and digital financial products and services such as savings accounts, micro-loans, insurance, pensions by Nigerians. EFInA survey lists challenges to financial inclusion The EFInA survey report concluded that three factors of affordability, institutional exclusion and lack of awareness were the biggest obstacles to financial inclusion. According to EFInA, 60.1 million Nigerians do not have/use a bank account, 96.3 million do not have/use mobile money and 97.9 million do not have insurance. On the digital usage in the country, it revealed that mobile money, which was thought to be useful in the financial inclusion drive, was found to only deepen rather than expand financial inclusion. The report therefore, revealed that while 35.5 million Nigerians (36.6 per cent of the adult population) use bank accounts only 3.0 million adults have both mobile money and bank accounts, whereas 59.4 million (60 per cent) neither have mobile money nor bank account. Similarly, the study showed that while 82 per cent of adults, comprising subsistence farmers and small business owners, receive their income in cash, 10 per cent of those adults receive their own income via mobile money or bank account, while another eight per cent did not receive any income at all. Savings in the country dropped by 13.3 per cent according to the report, while savings in assets, property, and livestock rose from 47.4 million to 54.7 million since 2016. Other decrease in respect of this indicator was that of borrowing, which went down by 2.0per cent and remittances to one per cent. On financial access by gender, the report indicated that out of 99.6 million adults in the country, 33.5 million male were financially included compared with 29.4 million female. This represents a decrease in the exclusion rate of 4.3 per cent and 5.7 per cent in the male and female gender respectively, and a decrease of 4.8 per cent for both gender compared with the 2016 figures. On financial access by age groups, the report revealed that Nigerians in the age bracket of 36 to 45 (19.5 million and 30.6 per cent exclusion) have more access to finance than all others. This group was followed by those in the age bracket of 26 to 35 (30.3 million and 31.5 per cent exclusion) and 46 to 55 (10.9 million and 32.4 per cent exclusion). In summary, the 2018 EFInA report revealed that 36.6 million (63 million have access to finance) Nigerians are now financially excluded against 56.3 million in the 2016 report. Of this number, the exclusion by gender shows 55.9 per cent for female and 44.1 per cent for male. The exclusion rate of 34 per cent among those aged between 18 and 25 is the highest, whereas the exclusion rate in the rural and urban areas stood at 78.5 per cent and 21.5per cent respectively. The report indicated N15,000 as the median income of the 99.6 million adult Nigerians, whereas 71.3 per cent of that number did not have access to mobile money accounts, and a mere 17.5 per cent as the borrowing rate among Nigerians. CBN’s data The CBN has also released the guidelines for the regulation of PSB in Nigeria. When this comes into effect this year, it will provide a level playing field for the provision of payment services to the bottom of the pyramid. The regulator has also spelt out the requirements, the structure, what will be allowed and what will be considered illegalities. The key objective is to accelerate financial inclusion in rural areas. By so doing, there will be increased access to deposit products, payments and remittance services to small businesses, low income households as well as entities through high-volume low-value transaction in a secured technology-driven environment. The FSS2020 initiatives were carefully tailored to align with the mandate of these institutions that have the responsibility to implement the identified initiatives, which is within the realm of the FSS2020 objectives. For Instance, the CBN has achieved a lot in the areas of Payment System Vision 2020, which is an initiative of the FSS 2020 along with the cashless policy.
