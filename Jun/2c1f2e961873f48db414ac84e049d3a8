Uchenna Kanu has affirmed that the Super Falcons are ready for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup slated for France. Falcons travelled out to France on Tuesday after about three weeks extensive preparations in Austria and Kanu in an interview noted that they have had the best of build up to the World Cup and that they are hoping to give a good account of themselves right from their first game on Friday against Norway. “I think my team is ready to compete based on the fact that we have been training a lot and we have played several friendly games too,” Kanu told the team official media office. “We are confident that we have a good team and we are sure we can go past the group stage. We have a good feeling about that too. It is really going to happen that way.” The Southeastern University, United States undergraduate corrected the impression that she was in the World Cup team because she took the place of a particular player and she insisted that it was her hard work from the start of the Falcons’ preparations until now that cemented her place. She also confirmed that she had a good season for a university team where she played 22 matches and scored 57 goals besides the goals she bagged for the women’s national team in the friendly games they played. “I had a goal set up for myself and I was working towards that goal,” she continued. “I didn’t really need to take anybody’s place or push anybody aside. I had a focus and I worked towards it. I knew that I am in the Super Falcons to come and make a name for myself, my family and my nation.” “The coaches made their decisions and I wasn’t there when the decision was taken. I have come to compete and it came out the way it did because I am part of the team. It is my time and it is about how much I have put in to be where I am now.”
