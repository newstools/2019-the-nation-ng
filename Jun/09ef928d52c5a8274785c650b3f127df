Determined to offer premium service to its customers across the country, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc on Tuesday launched 4G+ in three cities of Lagos, Abuja and Port-Harcourt. MTN 4G+ runs on 4G LTE advanced technology, using a combination of the recently acquired 800 megahertz (MHz) spectrum and 2600 MHz. The added spectrum and advanced technology extend the reach and capacity of MTN’s data network in Nigeria and it enables speeds of up to 200 Mbps. A 30-minute HD video could take as little as three minutes to download on 4G+, while the same video would take around eight minutes to download on standard 4G. The service, which became available immediately after the launch, will deliver much higher broadband speeds, a more consistent connection and significant improvement in indoor coverage. The network’s Chief Operating Officer, Mazen Mroue, said: “It’s about the customer. We put the customer at the heart of everything that we do.” He described the launch as a natural evolution from MTN’s already fast and reliable 4G network and further demonstrates the company’s commitment to continued investment in technology that caters to the present and future needs of its customers and country. Mroue said: “At MTN, we believe that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life. With this enhancement, our customers in covered locations can expect faster downloads and uploads, and better browsing and streaming experiences. “The successful launch of our 4G+ network is a momentous occasion, which advances our quest to provide world-class service to our customers.” To activate the service and enjoy a new digital experience, customers need an MTN Standard 4G SIM, the upgrades of which are available nationwide.
