The Presidency on Friday explained that the establishment of Ruga settlements is not being supervised by the Office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, contrary to claims reported in sections of the media. The Ruga initiative, according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Laolu Akande, is different from the National Livestock Transformation Plan approved by State governors under the National Economic Council (NEC) chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. He said that NEC on January 17, 2019, approved the plan based on the recommendations of a Technical Committee of the Council chaired by Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, with State Governors of Adamawa, Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Edo, Plateau, Oyo & Zamfara as members. Laolu said “The National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) 2019-2028 is a programme to be implemented in 7 pilot states of Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Taraba and Zamfara (as decided by NEC in January), being States in the front-lines of the Farmer-Herder crises. Afterwards, six other States have indicated readiness to also implement the plan. They are Katsina, Kano, Kogi, Kwara, Ondo, and Edo states. “The plan has six pillars through which it aims to transform the livestock production system in Nigeria along market oriented value chain while ensuring an atmosphere of peace and justice. “The six key pillars include: “In all the Federal Government will not impose on any State government regarding its land.” he added
