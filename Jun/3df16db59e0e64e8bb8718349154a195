Bayelsa women under the auspices of Grassroots Leadership Forum (GLF) have declared a prayer session for the emergence of Preye Aganaba as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the November governorship election in Bayelsa State.The women said after analysing the political environment, they found out that Aganaba, who is a founding member of the APC, had the passion and capacity to change the narrative of Bayelsa for good. The leader of the group, Mrs. Victoria E. James, said though GLF is a non-governmental organisation, its members embarked on non-stop prayer session, following their desire to have a better Bayelsa. She explained that the ambition of Prince Preye Aganaba, who hails from Odi in Kolokuma-Opokuma Local Government Area, was not ordinary but was borne out of his selfless interest to develop the people and the state. She described the GLF as an organisation with over 3000 members across the eight local government areas of the state. Also, another leader of the group, Mrs. Elizabeth Amakiri, said Aganaba proved to be a leader with a heart of gold following his track records of achievements and uprightness. She listed many federal projects attracted by Aganaba to Bayelsa and his philanthropic gestures to the needy in the society, saying the prince won the heart of majority of Bayelsans.
