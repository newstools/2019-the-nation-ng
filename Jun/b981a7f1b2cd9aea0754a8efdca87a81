Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho has revealed that his future at the club remains uncertain. The Brazilian, who is the most expensive transfer in the Blaugrana’s history, has expressed his doubts over his continuity in Catalonia. “I don’t know if I will continue at Barcelona,” Coutinho told the media. “Nobody knows about the future, and right now I am focused on playing with my [national] team [at the Copa America].” Coutinho could depart Barcelona on a transfer or as part of a swap deal with Paris Saint-Germain, which could see Neymar’s return to the Camp Nou. The 27-year-old has already ruled out the possibility of moving to Manchester United due to his past with Liverpool.
