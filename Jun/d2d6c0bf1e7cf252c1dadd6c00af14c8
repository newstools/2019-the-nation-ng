The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has suspended the implementation of the new tariffs. NAFDAC, in a statement by its Director of Public Affairs Dr. Abubakar Jimoh, stated the decision became necessary following the agitations against the new tariffs. The implementation of the tariff was expected to have commenced on 1st June, but did not go down well with other stakeholders who resisted it. To douse the tension, the council urged all the parties to maintain status quo, while it continue to dialogue with critical stakeholders on the review of tariffs. The statement reads: ‘In a decisive and quick move to douse tension and assuage the yearnings of stakeholders in the pharmaceutical, Food and Allied Industries, the Governing Council of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has suspended implementation of the new tariffs which came into effect on 1st June, 2019. “After a marathon Stakeholders Forum and Meeting of the Governing Council, it was resolved that all NAFDAC Stakeholders affected by the new tariffs will henceforth revert to payment of the old tariffs until further notice. Chairman of NAFDAC Governing Council, Hon. Inuwa Abdul-Kadir said the status quo remains while NAFDAC will continue to dialogue with all the concerned stakeholders on the tariff review and other regulatory issues. “Abdul-Kadir said the Council has considered substantially the inputs of the stakeholders in arriving at a new tariff regime which will soon be released by the Agency after doing all the needful including sensitising the public before it becomes effective. According to him, the suspension of the new tariffs was borne out of NAFDAC’s avowed commitment to the promotion of the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the country.
