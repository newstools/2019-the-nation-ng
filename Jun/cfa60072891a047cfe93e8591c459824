There is tension in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, over an alleged plot to stop the 2021 governorship ambition of the former Central Bank of Nigeria CBN Governor, Prof Chukwuma Charles Soludo. The situation is creating a fresh crisis in the party, as majority of the members have vowed to stage a protest against the plot on a yet to be announced date. There was strong indication Saturday in Awka that the party has concluded arrangements to sponsor Sir Damian Okolo from Nnewi as its preferred candidate ahead of Soludo. Besides, it was equally gathered that the Catholic Church hierarchy has endorsed Okolo to succeed Governor Willie Obiano in 2021 from Anambra South senatorial zone. However, speaking with The Nation on Saturday in Awka, the APGA state Chairman, Sir Norbert Obi, debunked the claim that APGA had endorsed anyone. Rather, he said what the party did was to zone the governorship position to the South senatorial zone based on equity and fairness. He further denied the claim that crisis was rocking the party, while waiving the threat from some party faithful to stage a protest against the state government and party over such. According to him, “people know how to fabricate issues. Those seeking for party’s ticket are respected individuals in the society and we are proud of them. But if anybody tells you that the party has decided on the position that is the greatest lie of the century. “APGA is focused on anything it does and we are not going to make any mistakes when the time comes. Governor Obiano has done well and has made members of APGA and the state proud. Therefore, any one coming to take over from him will have a serious challenge, “Obi said
