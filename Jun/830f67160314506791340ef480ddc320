English Premier League side Chelsea may be forced to shorten the loan deal of Super Eagles winger Victor Moses with Turkish League side Fenerbahce. The Stamford Bridge landlords have been boxed into a corner by FIFA ban denying them the liberty of signing new players ahead of Champions league campaign next season. Chelsea are fighting a punishment imposed by world football’s governing body FIFA after being found guilty of offences in signing overseas players under the age of 16. FIFA fined Chelsea £475,000 in February and issued a ban on registering any new players for the next two transfer windows Although Chelsea boasts of many players on loan across the globe many of the players will not be able to meet the criteria for home grown players. The club may be forced to ask for the return of Moses who is classified as home-grown player.  That however may not be done in jiffy considering that the Nigerian international who announced his retirement from international football shortly after the world cup in Russia, still has six months into an 18-month loan deal at Fenerbahce. Former Chelsea ace Frank Lampard is on the verge of taking over the club following the departure of former coach Maurizio Sarri who has since taken charge of Italian side Juventus.  Should Lampard eventually step in, the headache of raising a formidable team for the Champions league will fall on his shoulders. Chelsea have since appealed to CAS but their case will not be heard until after the summer transfer window closes, meaning no new signings will arrive at Stamford Bridge before the start of next season.
