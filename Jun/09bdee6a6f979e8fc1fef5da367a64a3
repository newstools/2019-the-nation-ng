For pitching an innovative idea, Helifest High School, Lagos has won the maiden edition of most innovative school in Ajegunle with a prize money of N100,000. The school emerged winner at a Leadership conference for school prefects in Ajegunle, which has as theme: “Slumcity to smart city: The prefects’ role”. Joseph Jonah, who led the school’s team, shared the idea of “connecting incredible artisans in Ajegunle to the world through a website to link them to prospective clients that would employ them for jobs”. The prize money would be used to build the website. Convener of the event and Project Manager of Transforming Ajegungle Project (TAP), Grace Nkwocha, said the contest was a community development contest targeted at engaging pupils to employ critical thinking skills in solving problems in their communities, adding that education should be a tool for community development and Nigeria at large. She said the school requested less than N100,000 for the project, but after assessment, the sponsor decided to increase the seed fund. Miss Nkwocha, however, noted that other finalists would not be left out as they would also benefit from free coding classes and transportation to and from classes. On why the conference was for prefects alone, Miss Nkwocha said: “We were just thinking of how we can influence small spaces and we thought about the school. The school has a very large crowd and we can control that space and we thought who are the people that we need to infiltrate that space and create that change and we thought of the prefect;s and we said okay we are going to be having continuous programmes with them and use them as conduit pipes to drive the change we desire.”
