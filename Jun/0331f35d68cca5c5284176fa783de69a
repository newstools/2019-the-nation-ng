The Management of Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti has issued a query to one of its lecturer, Dr. O.O Aduwo, who was allegedly involved in sexual scandal. Aduwo was seen unclad in a 29- second video trending footage on social media while allegedly attempting to have carnal knowledge of one of his students. The senior lecturer in the department of Accounting of the institution was caught by the lady’s boyfriend and his friends who had informed the lady to play along with the lecturer. It was learnt they besieged the residence of the female student with a tip off that Aduwo would be visiting the lady. Some people were seen dragging the embattled lecturer out of a room with a plea that they should have mercy on him. According to the video, a student was seen chanting with an audible voice saying “This is a lecturer of EKSU. He wants to have S*x with a student”. The institution, in a statement  in Ado-Ekiti by its Directorate of Information and Corporate Affairs,  Mr. Bode Olofinmuagun, said the query was to give the lecturer fair hearing so as to ensure justice and equity. Olifinmuagun said the management would not condone any act of sexual harassment in the university and as such, issued a query to Dr. Aduwo to defend himself from the allegation, as a first step in the spirit of due process. “After the response of the lecturer to the query, a panel of investigation will be constituted to get to the root of the matter, while the findings of the panel will be made public. “The general public is hereby assured that management would continue to be transparent and would not allow such a matter that could smear its good image to be swept under the carpet,” he said.
