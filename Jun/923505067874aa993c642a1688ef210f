The airline’s crew, who spoke at the programme included a pilot, Capt. Babajide Oni and Wale Odeyemi, a Cabin Crew Training Instructor. They told the students that they could become pilots, aircraft engineers and cabin crew members by remaining focused on their academic studies. Odeyemi said the programme, apart from kindling the students’ interest in aviation, was also aimed at sensitising them on the importance of the airline’s crew to safety of passengers. According to him, there is the need for a replacement of the aging workforce in the aviation industry. Capt. Oni noted that the cost of studying at the Nigerian College  Aviation Technology, Zaria and International Aviation College, Ilorin, was expensive stressing that some students could however get scholarships if they are hardworking and brilliant. The Administrator of the school, Rev. Fr. Leo Muoneme, said the school would continue to encourage students to follow their passion. “We want our students to be able to stand anywhere in the world and say they received solid secondary school education foundation. “They can decide to choose any profession but we believe that they should have passion for it and utilise their God-given talents,” he said. The cleric expressed optimism that the Nigerian aviation industry was being strengthened by Arik Air and other airlines, adding that it would be great if some of the students become part of the aviation sector in future.
