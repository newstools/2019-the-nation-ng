A 35-year-old man, Elochukwu Ogboo, has reportedly committed suicide at Amaezike village, Agulu, in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State. The deceased reportedly took his own life on Saturday night, a day after a tipper lorry crushed his younger brother near their family house on Agulu–Ekwulobia road. The Nation gathered that neighbours woke up on Sunday to behold Ogboo’s body in a three-bedroom bungalow under construction. A resident, who spoke in confidence, said the body was dangling from a rope tied to his neck and suspended on the lintel of the building in their family compound. He said Elochukwu and his younger brother had a single parent, adding that their mother, who later got married, had also died. “They were living with their 85-year-old step-father, Chief Ignatiue Ogboo. Their step mother is late too,” he said. Worshippers at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, near the scene of the incident, were said to have surged to the scene from early morning mass to have a glimpse of the body. When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer of the state, Mr. Haruna Mohammed said he was unaware of the incident as he was out of the state. “I’ll get back to you after making inquiries from the Divisional Police Officer, Neni who is in charge of the area,” he said.
