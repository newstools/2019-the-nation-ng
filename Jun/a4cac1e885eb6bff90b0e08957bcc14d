The rift between National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki appeared deepened as the lawmakers-elect for the Edo State House of Assembly rejected nomination for the House leadership by the State Executive Committee of the APC. Three lawmakers-elect from Edo Central Senatorial district are in the race for the position of the Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly. They are Frank Okiye (Esan North East 1) Emmanuel Okoduwa (Esan North East 11) and Victor Edoror (Esan Central). A meeting between the state leadership of the APC and the lawmakers-elect ended in deadlock as the lawmakers-elect insisted on not abiding by the decision of the party. Sources said the Edo APC stuck to Hon Frank Okiye as the Speaker but the lawmakers-elect rejected the proposal on ground that they should be given the independence to choose their leaders during plenary. The source said the lawmakers-elect argued that they would not allow Governor Obaseki pick their leaders for them. Another source said what the lawmakers-elect demanded was just proclamation letter from the governor. A chieftain of the party who pleaded anonymity said the lawmakers-elect were asked to go and choose their leaders based on zoning arrangement of the party. According to the source, the Speakership seat was zoned to Edo Central, Deputy Speakerâ€™s and Deputy Whip seat were zoned to Owan Federal Constituency while the Chief Whip seat was zoned to Edo South.
