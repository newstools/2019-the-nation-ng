Nigeria’s senior national team’s chief coach Gernot Rohr has revealed that Katsina United FC’ goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa has sustained slight knee injury to his but is optimistic that he will make the final 23-man squad to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations holding in Egypt. Disclosing this to NationSport in an interview in Asaba Thursday, Rohr said: ”At the moment there are no injuries, Ezenwa got a knock on his knees on Thursday in training, I hope he is okay. This afternoon (Thursday) again we will train. Zimbabwe is one of the two friendlies before AFCON. So, we have to do two things, prepare the team to find harmony with the return of Mikel Obi. We have to bring him in and deal with the complexities. ” If you know one goalkeeper better than the ones we have in camp, please tell us. We are searching all over the world, we cannot find any. We have one in Dusseldorf, Germany. He is interesting, we are watching him. As at today, I do not know who is No 1, Uzoho was No 1 during the World Cup, I took a big risk, but he did well. After the Mundial, he has had difficulty at his club. He went on loan to Cyprus. Administrative issues prevented him from playing regularly, so I sent a goalkeeper trainer to drill him for two weeks as we had before the World Cup. ”Uzoho made a big mistake during the game against Seychelles and his confidence took a big hit, but his performance in the U-23 team has helped. Daniel is an experienced keeper, playing in a good league in South Africa and Ezenwa is doing very well in the local league. I think Ezenwa’s faithful attitude is helping the team. The solidarity among the various national teams is a major plus for the Super Eagles, there is no African country with this type of solidarity and this will come in handy during the AFCON.
