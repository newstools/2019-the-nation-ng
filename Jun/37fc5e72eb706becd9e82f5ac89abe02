An unspecified number of Boko Haram Terrorists have been eliminated at the fringes of Sambisa forest, the Nigerian Air Force said on Monday. Its spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said air strikes were conducted at specific targets and structures of the terrorists in Sambisa in continuation of clearance operations. He explained in a statement supported with video footage that the operations were conducted after intelligence reports had established the presence of the terrorists in the area. He said:” In continuation of its sustained air strikes against terrorists’ targets in Borno State, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has severely degraded another Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) hideout in the Sambisa Forest. “The operation was executed yesterday, 16 June 2019, after persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed heavy presence of BHTs at a new camp with several structures hidden under the thick foliage of the Forest. “Accordingly, the ATF dispatched an Alpha Jet to attack the location. ” Its bombs hit the target area, with devastating effects on several of the camouflaged structures, neutralizing their BHT occupants.” Daramola assured that the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain the efforts to completely degrade the terrorists in the Northeast.
