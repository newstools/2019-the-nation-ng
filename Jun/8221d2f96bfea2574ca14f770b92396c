NOLLYWOOD actress Ufuoma Mcdermott is already publicising her next project ‘The USM Show with Ufuoma Mcdermott’, a theatrical entertainment show set to hold on Saturday, July 27 at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on social media. Speaking on the birth of the show which she revealed came to reality with the support of popular comedian Seyi Law, the actress posted the details on her Instagram account. “Last year, I told @seyilaw1 that I wanted to put up a live show. It was as if I had opened pandora’s box… in a good way. #SeyiLaw didn’t hold back even 1 information. He gave me pointers and I started developing #TheUSMshow. “By December we had had a couple of sit downs and he had shared contacts with me. Even while he was preparing for his UK tour, Seyi was consulting over the phone and pointing me in the right direction. When I got too scared about the dream, he’d reassure that I could do it! Because of him, I have @theusmshow. “Seyi, I can never repay this kindness but I charge the heavens to open up before you in new ways. May God always raise soldiers to clear the path before you. May you never run out of helpers. May your joy be forever. #HappyBirthday bruv. God bless you richly.” The USM show which is likened to a cabaret-style show with music as the main attraction is a form of theatrical entertainment featuring music, song, dance, recitation, or drama. Inspired by the likes of Moulin Rouge, The Greatest Showman, Circle du Soleil, and Broadway shows, the glamorous event is principally driven by a musical dance drama live on stage, divided into four acts. Between each act, guests are further entertained in music, comedy, and dance as interludes and the event is wrapped up by A-list closing act. The maiden edition of the show is titled “The Magic Of Dream’.
