Roseline Oloto, 35, who allegedly stood as a surety for a suspect involved in a case of conspiracy and stealing, was on Monday arraigned in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Oloto, whose address was not provided, is facing a two-count charge bordering on attempt to pervert justice. The Prosecutor, Insp Chekwube Okeh, said that Oloto stood as a surety for one Chris Oladipo on Feb. 14 at Alausa Police Station, Ikeja. Okeh said that the surety failed to produce Oladipo when needed by the police for investigation. She told the court that Oladipo was involved in a case of conspiracy and stealing. The prosecutor said that the surety signed an undertaking to produce Oladipo at the police station whenever needed or forfeit N600, 000 to the Lagos State Government. She told the court that the surety and the suspect absconded after securing the bail. Okeh said that when the police invited Oladipo on Feb. 18, the defendant failed to produce him. “Oloto failed to present the suspect each time they were needed,” he said. The surety, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the alleged offences contravene Sections 97 and 123 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). Section 97 provides seven years’ imprisonment for perversion of justice. The Magistrate, Mrs A.O Akinde, granted Oloto N100, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Akinde said that the surety should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case till June 26 for mention.
