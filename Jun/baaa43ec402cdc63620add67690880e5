IT was like a scene from a Nollywood movie for some commuters who were travelling recently from Ekpoma in Edo State to Benin, the state capital, in a vehicle owned by a popular transport company in the state. A few kilometres to Benin City, the vehicle was stopped by some policemen at a checkpoint. The passengers were happy because the vehicle’s driver had been driving recklessly. Then the policemen took a cursory look into the vehicle, sighted a young man in his early 30s and asked him to come down. They demanded for his phone and ordered him to unlock it. He did. Just when it looked like the young man’s phone was all the police would ask of him, they demanded for his laptop computer. He told the policemen that he did not have his laptop with him, but they threatened to deal with him if they searched and found the laptop. At that point, he produced the laptop and they searched through it. After about 10 minutes, a passenger who had become impatient approached the policemen and pleaded that they should release the boy so that they could continue their journey. But one of the policemen retorted: “Gentleman, do you know what you are asking us to do? This young man can finish all of you. He is a yahoo boy!” While the conversation was going on, the young man, who had been handed back his phone, called somebody on it, and in the course of their conversation, was heard saying that he did not have up to N250,000 on him. When the telephone conversation ended, the young man turned to the leader of the police team for negotiation. At the end of the discussion, he parted with N88,000 and was released immediately.
