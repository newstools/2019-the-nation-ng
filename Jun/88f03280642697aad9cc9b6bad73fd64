THE embarrassing defeat suffered by the PDP in Tuesday’s contest for the position of Senate President would have been avoided but for the insistence of a South-south governor on the eve of the election that the party must adopt a candidate, contrary to the party’s initial position that it would not present or adopt any. The South-south governor, whose state is awash with oil funds as a result of hefty monthly allocations and also the centre of war in past elections, was in Abuja a day before the election, where he argued forcefully for the party to adopt a candidate. Even when other top party members drew his attention to the fact that the PDP did not have the number for a keen contest, he retorted: “What is number?” He then said he was ready to put down any amount to buy over enough APC members-elect to make up the number the PDP needed. At that point, the opposition party decided to adopt APC’s Senator Ali Ndume who lost to Senator Ahmad Lawan by a wide margin. Whether the South-south governor spent the money or APC senators-elect collected but voted their conscience, no one knows. But adapting the words of former Akwa Ibom State governor, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the South-south governor reportedly boasted that the votes that money cannot get, more money will get.
