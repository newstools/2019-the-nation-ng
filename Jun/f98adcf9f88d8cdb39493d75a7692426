The summit planning committee of the 2019 US-African Trade and Investments Global Summit (USATIGS) has said the summit will encourage the establishment of a long-term trade partnership and business linkages between Africans and the Americans. The planning committee gave this assurance in a statement by Nassiri Hannifa Bamba, Director of Communications, U.S.- Africa Trade Council. It also announced Turkish Airlines as the official airlines sponsor of this year’s summit which comes up between September 26-28 in Atlanta, Geogia, USA. According to Bamba, the summit is more than a business opportunity, “it’s a movement for business success stories, a trade summit and multi-sector expo that will provide African countries a strong platform and excellent opportunity to exhibit and promote their products and services in the United States”. The statement reads: “The summit will also address the constraints and barriers that exist in identifying export markets for African product lines and will be of immense benefit to participants.” Participants, Bamba said, will network with representatives of the U.S. Administration, financial power houses, investors and technical partners seeking business opportunities in Africa. He added: “Delegates will be treated to the best of scenic tours Atlanta has to offer, which includes a special golf tournament, tours of CNN headquarters, the Martin Luther King Centre and the Delta Museum.” Publisher of Elite International Magazine Idris Alabidun said: “The three-day summit will provide a powerful stage to engage and showcase appropriate technological inventions and enormous trade potentials, as well as harness and showcase feasible and attractive investment opportunities across the huge U.S. -African trade axis.” USATIGS 2019 is the third in the series of trade summits, scaling out from the erstwhile successful US-Nigeria Agribusiness Investment Summit (USNAGRIS).
