FINANCIAL crisis is looming in the 33 local governments in Oyo State as sacked chairmen have written to banks and Heads of Local Governments (HLAs) warning against effecting financial transactions unauthorized by them. All the chairmen of the 33 local governments and 35 Local Council Development Areas (LCDA) served the letter on Friday, The Nation gathered. The embattled chairmen had rejected their sack by the new governor, Seyi Makinde, declaring that the dissolution was a violation of the May 6  judgment of a High Court  which restrained the state government or the House of Assembly from dissolving them having been democratically elected on May 12 last year. They insisted that the proper thing for Makinde to do is to appeal the subsisting judgment instead of what they described as ‘backdoor’ means. In the Friday letter, the chairmen said any HLA or bank that fails to seek confirmation from them before carrying out transactions on the accounts of their council would be disobeying the court and would face the “full wrath” of the law. A statement by the chairman of the state’s chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) said: “This is to notify all the Heads of Local Government Administration and banks not to tamper with the accounts of the various councils because the chairmen of these councils were democratically elected and the governor does not have the power to stop the councils from performing their statutory functions. “The Heads of Local Government and banks should confirm with the chairman of any local government or local council development area before carrying out any transaction on any of the council’s account. “They risk facing the contempt of court if they fail to comply with this directive and they will face the full wrath of the law.” The warning may trigger a financial crisis in the councils pending the resolution of the debacle.
