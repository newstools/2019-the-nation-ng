Ahead of the new basketball season, the Nigeria Basketball Federation has called on interested individuals and corporate entities to apply for slots in the Zenith Bank sponsored Women’s Basketball League. Rising from its board meeting held in Lagos on Monday, the federation said that in line with the mission statement of the federation, interested teams are encouraged to register their teams ahead of the2019 season. The NBBF President, Engr Musa Kida said “For us, we are looking to expand and make sure we accommodate as many teams as possible”. With the NBBF Secretariat currently attending to numerous applications and interest letters, Kida said the process for the final selections will be free and fair to all. “I am quite happy with what I see in terms of response and I just want everybody to be rest assured that anybody who expresses interest will surely be considered and given a chance to participate. The smallest women’s team that can express interest in participating in the league will be given the chance”, Kida assured. Knowing fully well that there is a risk of oversubscription following the continued growth of basketball in Nigeria, the NBBF board said it is ready to consider and accommodate all genuine clubs. “If we have an oversubscription, we are ready to consider everybody in a way that they will participate and after we would have the numbers of teams that we require for the league.” The Zenith Women’s Basketball League will tip off on July 1.
