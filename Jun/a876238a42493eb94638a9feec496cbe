The Senator, who insisted that he would not withdraw from the race, told reporters in Abuja “that will not happen.” While urging his supporters and colleagues in the Senate to disregard the information that he had stepped down, he described it as “unimaginable, unthinkable and the machination of some over zealous and too ambitious persons who will go the extra mile to bring down others.” Alimikhena said that his decision to contest for the position was with the blessings and permission of the entire people of his constituency which he was not willing to relinquish or betray for anything. He said that it should be known his ambition to emerge the next Deputy Senate President “remains intact and unshakable.” He expressed confidence that he will emerge victorious when his colleagues vote in the chamber tomorrow. He said: “My attention has been drawn to speculations in some quarters claiming that I, Francis Alimikhena has stepped down from the race for the position of Deputy Senate President. I have not stepped down. “I have been a very loyal party member, my relationship also cuts across party divide.” There are insinuations the All Progressives Congress (APC) has anointed the Delta Central Senator, Ovie Omo-Agege, as its choice for the Deputy Senate President for the Ninth Senate.
