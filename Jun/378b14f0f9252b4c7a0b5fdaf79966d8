The Imo State Government on Wednesday said it inherited judgment debts of over N20 billion incurred by the administration of ex-governor Rochas Okorocha. It said the debts, which had almost collapsed the government, arose from subsisting court judgments, Orders, Garnishee Orders and Proceedings for Execution of judgments and orders of courts against the state. Imo State Attorney-General, Ndukwe Nnawuchi, SAN, made the claims in a statement to The Nation yesterday. Nnawuchi said: “The present administration is as a result inundated and consistently harassed, embarrassed and put under pressure by the judgment creditors whose drive to execute the aforesaid judgments, orders and garnishee proceedings has brought the smooth running of government to a near halt, leading to an imminent collapse of government.” He accused Okorocha of “deliberately” foisting the “unenviable situation” on his successor, Governor Emeka Ihedioha. Nnawuchi re-affirmed Ihedioha’s government commitment to the Rule of Law. He added: “Accordingly, and in pursuance of that commitment, all judgment creditors and beneficiaries of garnishee orders (whether nisi or absolute) are kindly requested to report at the chambers of the Honourable Attorney General, Imo State Secretariat, new Owerri, at 8.00am on Monday, 1st July, 2019 with Certified  True Copies of such Judgments and Orders for the purpose of initiating the process of resolving and ultimately satisfying the said Judgments and Orders of court conveniently, amicably and without acrimony. “This will guarantee avoidable hardship to both judgment creditors and government. The understanding and cooperation of all concerned are hereby solicited, so that together we can rebuild Imo State.”
