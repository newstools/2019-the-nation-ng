Former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki has urged Nigerians to embrace the significance of June 12 as Democracy Day while working together to defend and protect the nation’s democracy and its institutions. In a message by his Special Adviser (SA) on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the former Senate President emphasised that Nigeria must also honour its heroes, like Bashorun M. K. O. Abiola, the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election, as well as others who played key roles in making the elections possible and actualising it. Saraki said: “Democracy Day is a sombre commemoration of our nation’s history. It is a reminder that a government for, of, and by the people is and must be Nigeria’s only recourse. “As we commemorate the day and remember our heroes, like Chief M.K.O. Abiola, we must all collectively commit to playing our own individual roles in the defence of Nigeria’s democracy. “Moving forward, all Nigerians must see this day as one to recommit ourselves towards the patriotic ideals of unity, peace, faith and brotherliness. The significance of June 12 cannot be understated in our nation, and this is why the eighth National Assembly worked to fast-track its passage into law as a national holiday. “It is my belief that what we need to do to commemorate June 12 is to grow the economy and ensure that we banish poverty, squalor, illiteracy, diseases, insecurity and underdevelopment from our country to enable our people enjoy the benefits of democracy and the government they freely chose.”
