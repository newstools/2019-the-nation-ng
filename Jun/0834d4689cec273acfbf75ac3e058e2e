THERE is hope for electricity consumers to get meters as Metering Solution Manufacturing Service Limited(MSMSL) has offered to assist other meter asset providers (MAPs). The development, follows the inability of the Meter Assets Providers(MAP) recently approved by the Federal Government to get enough meters for consumers, that were under their jurisdictions. In line with the MAPs regulation issued by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission(NERC), MAPs are expected to partner the 11 power distribution companies (DisCos) to ensure seamless distribution to the consumers. Also, the regulations stated that MAPs must meet at least 30 per cent local content in meter supplies, an issue that has become a challenge in the sector. Signing a metering agreement with the Eko Electricity Distribution Company(EKEDC) in Lagos, a firm, Metering Solution ManufacturingService Limited(MSMSL), offered to end the metering problem in the country. Armese Power Solutions Chief Executive Officer Aslam Khorkar said the firm will plunge the gap in the production and supply of meters. Khorkar said: â€œ Our manufacturing subsidiary operating as Metering Manufacturing Solutions Manufaturing Service Limited(MSMSL) has the capacity to produce three million meters yearly on a multi-shift pattern.
