The Director General of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said the scheme will communicate to corps members when the payment of N30,000 new allowance takes off. Ibrahim spoke in Abuja, the nation’s capital, at a workshop/training on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for desk officers of the NYSC. When asked when the payment of N30,000 allowance for corps members would take off, he said: “They will be communicated accordingly, please.” The DG said the workshop was aimed at consolidating on the successes recorded by the scheme on the use of the FOIA. Ibrahim said the scheme had grappled with challenges, which were occasioned by “apparent lack of knowledge of our policies and operations by a section of the public”. The DG urged Nigerians to familiarise themselves with the NYSC Act to enable them understand better the operations of the scheme and its role. He said: “Since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in 2011, the NYSC has been in the forefront of ensuring total compliance with the provisions of the Act.” The NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, Mrs Adenike Adeyemi, noted that the scheme had FOI community development service groups for corps members to assist in sensitising the public on the FOI Act.
