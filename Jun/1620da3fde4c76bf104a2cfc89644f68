The Nigeria Institution of Estate Surveyors & Valuers (NIESV) has called for urban regeneration of Lagos State. They said a development plan is needed as the population growth is expected to double by 2050, making it the third most populous city in the world according to reports by Worldpopulationreview.com. Its Chairman,  Lagos Branch, Mr. Adedotun Bamigbola stated this in Ikeja in his maiden interaction with reporters after his inauguration. He said the incessant building collapse speaks volume of the need for urban regeneration as well as regular infrastructure re-evaluation and re-development.  He said this is against the incommensurate rate of infrastructure development within the state, which the current government has promised to tackle. There is a need to regularly urge regulatory agencies to check on defective buildings or better still monitor buildings under construction. It is not enough to give permits for building construction but to ensure that what is submitted as drawing is what is built, he added. He said: “Urban redevelopment  is what is needed in the state now by the government but the private sector have taken the lead by redeveloping parts of  old Yaba and building new structures that are vertical in nature to take in more people in a decent and healthy environment. Urban renewal agencies should identify old buildings and bring out workable plans for the owners on how to best redevelop them.” On the programme of his administration, Bamigbola said he tagged it as “The agenda: The future is here”, which encapsulates the plans of his administration to move the branch forward and ensure it continues to play the leadership role in the institution and the profession. On the key elements of the agenda he said it include research and development, strategic partnership, capacity development, membership growth and welfare and strategic projects.
