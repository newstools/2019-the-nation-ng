HEDGE fund investor turned rapper, Yearwood, is making a big splash in Nigeria. The rapper, the brain behind record label, Mission Road Entertainment, is seeking to build a global entertainment company. After earning an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, a Masters in Public Administration from Harvard University and completing the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program, Yearwood has combined his professional and educational experiences with his musical talents. Yearwood’s debut single, ‘Callaloo’, is a bouncy ode urging listeners to get money with religious fervour and part of his upcoming 11-track mixtape titled ’45 8th Street, Barataria’. His second single titled ‘Teddy Massacre’ will soon follow. Originally from Trinidad & Tobago in the Caribbean, Yearwood has chosen Nigeria as the first geographic market of focus. He is currently seeking potential investment partners to build out Mission Road Entertainment’s presence in Nigeria. While initially focused on music, Mission Road aims to develop content across video, gaming and other forms of storytelling. Yearwood, who also holds a BSC in Computer Science, intends to make technology a key component of his company’s development strategy.
