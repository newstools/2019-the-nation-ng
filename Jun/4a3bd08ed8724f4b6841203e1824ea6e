Dr. Rueben Abati, a former Special Adviser (SA) on Media and Publicity to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has praised his wife, Iyabode, for standing by him throughout their marriage. Abati said Iyabode, who has been his friend since he first met her 27 years ago, had given him “wonderful children”. The award-winning newspaper columnist and former Chairman of the Editorial Board and Editorial Page Editor of The Guardian spoke at the weekend in Lagos at an event to mark Iyabode’s 50th birthday. Abati noted that he and Iyabode, founder of All Drinks Affairs Concepts and Milage Properties Limited, had been together since she was 23 and he 26. He said: “People who know me very well will know that I’m a very difficult person. I have my own ideas, I have my own standards. But she’s been able to tolerate me, persevere; that is something I admire in her. “She doesn’t steal my money, she doesn’t mismanage my money,” he added light-heartedly. Abati said there was often a contest between him and Iyabode over who their children took after in terms of intelligence. “In fact, when I look at the children, we argue every day; you know, she says she is the one who has the brains and I say no, I’m the one with the brains. “…But we thank God. It is a joint effort. We thank God for what He has been able to do for us. “She has never held a major party in our house; this is her first major party, the only thing she has done for herself. Every other party she has done for herself and she committed herself to serving other people. But today, this is her event,” he added.
