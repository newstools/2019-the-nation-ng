After this, contestants will head back to the East for the quarter-finals in Port Harcourt on July 14. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled to hold in Enugu and Onitsha on August 4 and August 18 respectively. Nollywood star, Gideon Okeke, has been announced as the official TV host for the show. Speaking after the event, Egwu shared his vision for the 2019 edition of Hi-Life Fest. “This is one of the ways we connect with our consumers and celebrate our shared love for highlife music,” said Egwu. “After two successful editions, which produced two remarkable talented musical acts, we’ve decided to take this competition a step further and showcase these talents to the whole of Africa. Our partnership with Soundcity will see us release episodes of this year’s competition. This television treatment will not only showcase the talents of our contestants but will also profile their evolution as they go along the tournament and expose them to a wider audience. We want to celebrate their progress and show the world that some of the best musical talents can be discovered in South-Eastern Nigeria.”
