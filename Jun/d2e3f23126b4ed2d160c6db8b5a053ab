FrieslandCampina WAMCO, makers of Peak and Three Crowns dairy brands, has treated over 1,000 dairy farmers to a surprise Peak Breakfast as part of activities to celebrate this year’s World Milk Day. The World Milk Day is celebrated every June 1, and was established by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (UNFAO). It is an opportunity to raise global awareness on the importance of milk as a healthy diet, responsible food production and supporting dairy farm communities. Addressing farmers at the event, which held in Iseyin, Oyo State, during the week, FrieslandCampina WAMCO Managing Director, Mr. Ben Langat, commended the dairy farmers under its Dairy Development Programme (DDP) across 90 communities on the progress made so far. He said under the DPP, dairy farmers recently recorded 27,045 litres of milk supply in one day, years after the first 400 litres daily collection to Fashola in 2011. Langat, however, urged the farmers to increase their raw milk yield to justify the company’s plan to set up a Milk Processing Centre within the environs. “We are not only committed to providing affordable dairy products, we are also charged with the responsibility of increasing local milk sourcing and ensuring consumers, children and our dairy farmers enjoy the goodness of milk every day” Langat said, adding that FrieslandCampina WAMCO  has five milk collection centres, 10 milk collection points with 10 under construction across various communities in Oyo State. Nutrition Society of Nigeria Vice President, Prof. Wasiu Afolabi, who was at the event to engage and educate the farmers on the importance of consuming milk regularly, explained that it helps to support healthy lifestyles for both children and adults.
