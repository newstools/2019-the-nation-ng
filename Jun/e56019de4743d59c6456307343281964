A 300-level student of the Department of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Benin (UNIBEN), Miss Christabel Omoremime Buoro, has committed suicide after a break up with her boyfriend of many years. Christabel, aged 21, was discovered on Tuesday evening at her hostel flat at Plot 4 Uwaifo lane, Newton Street, Ekosodin area in Ovia North East local government area. Witnesses said the body of Christabell was discovered after she allegedly took some deadly substance to end her life. An empty sachet of Klin detergent was found at the spot where she took her life. According to the source, “A small girl of that age will take her life all because of one boy. The policemen that came to evacuate the body were very angry after reading out loud the note she dropped. “Thank God that she even dropped a note, if not the roommates would have been in hot soup, because investigation would have started from that point.” Two persons were said to have been invited by the police for questioning over contents of the letter. In the suicide note, she reportedly stated that she took her life because the guy she loved didn’t love her in return. The institution spokesman, Mr. Michael Osasuyi, said the incident did not happen within the school premises. Osasuyi said a team has been dispatched to investigate the incident and report back. He said the team was yet to submit its report.
