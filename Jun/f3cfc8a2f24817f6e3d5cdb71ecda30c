If you expect Eagles to be all over the place when they  file out today in the last group match against Madagascar, then you are in a for a disappointment as the players have resolved to take it  easy  while  assuring that they won’t lose. A cross section of the Players who bared their minds ahead of today’s encounter at the Alexandria Stadium, said though the Eagles have already booked a place in the round of 16, it is important to comprehensively finish as group leaders. “We are going to take it easy but we are not going to be careless, that is not to say that it will be an easy match because Madagascar definitely will be coming out in full force,” they submitted. Debutants Madagascar, who are currently second in the group are to get a draw against Eagles and equally hoping that Guinea and Guinea and Burundi end up preferable on a goalless draw. Jubilation which took the center stage in Madagascar following their defeat of Burundi in the second match, has given way quickly to permutations over the possible outcome of Nigeria/Madagascar match on one hand and Guinea/Burundi tie on the other. Some analyst believe Syli Nationale of Guinea have what it takes to displace Madagascar by beating Burundi but agree that a lone goal defeat may not do the magic. One player on the Nigerian side that is being tipped to start in today’s encounter is Samuel Kalu who bounced back to fitness after initial health setback and who came into the match against Guinea but had no time to express himself on the pitch before the referee blew the final whistle. On the Madagascan side Marco Ilaimaharita who was voted man of the match in the tie against Burundi will be hoping to re-enact his performance against the Eagles to further catapult his countrymen to cloud nine.
