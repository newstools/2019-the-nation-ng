Set to drop his six-song EP and videos this summer, US-based Nigerian DJ, DJ Dozzy Ross, has claimed he is among those who have been pushing Afrobeats music to the US and the world. Born Dozie Udemadu, Dj Dozzy Ross who presently lives in Miami, was originally from Anambra State, said that after practicing in the US, he decided to take his craft to the international scene. “I’m one of the pioneers of the Afrobeats movement,” said DJ Dozzy Ross who was trained in Atlanta by DJ D Cas of Connections DJs. “I started bringing Afrobeats artistes to Atlanta and all over USA for concerts and events since 2014 and was nominated at the 2015 AFRIMMA awards in Dallas as the best African DJ in USA. “I’ve worked with the likes of Davido, Olamide, Tekno, Wizkid, Runtown, Skales, Timaya, Psquare , Tiwa Savage, Don Jazzy, to name a few. Also, I worked with Akon and went on tour with him for his USA tour 2017. “Technically, I’m bridging the gap between Afrobeats and hip hop. In America prior to 2014, you could go to nightclubs including African clubs and not hear African music. We channelled the movement. As a DJ, I was among the first group of DJs who kept playing Afrobeats songs to different crowds. Blacks, Whites and Latinos until they became open to our music. Now, you can’t go to any club or event in America without the DJs playing Afrobeats songs, including hip hop. Now we are accepted in general as the new trend over here. Disc Jockeying in the USA took me to places I never dreamt of going. I’ve had the opportunity to DJ in China, Dubai, Mexico , Belize , France Jamaica, Aruba just to name a few.” DJ Dozzy Ross has a song, ‘Rihanna Body’, featuring Tekno and American rapper, Cap 1 who is signed to 2Chains. He is also working with Skales, Runtown and Ball Greezy.
