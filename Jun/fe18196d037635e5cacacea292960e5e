Former Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Hon. Abubakar Bwari said the solid minerals sector was lifeless and in a coma when he and the then minister, Dr. Kayode Fayemi took control in 2015. He said although he does not like repeating what they saw at their arrival, they had to bring together stakeholders in the ministry to develop a roadmap which has led to the progress that has been achieved so far. Speaking in Abuja at a dinner organised on his behalf by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, he said: “You all know how we met the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, I sometimes dont like repeating what we saw but one has to know where he is coming from to appreciate where we are today, we came to a ministry that is somehow lifeless, a ministry that was in a coma so to say. We all sat with stakeholders to develop a roadmap, which has brought us to where we are today. “Today we can all beat our chest to say that we came, we saw and we have risen the bar of mining activities in Nigeria. Today, Nigeria’s voice is being heard in the African and down under in Australia, it is clear in Tiajin Mining in China, it is one of the voices at the London mines and money etc. What we have tried to do is return Nigeria to the mining map of the world.”
