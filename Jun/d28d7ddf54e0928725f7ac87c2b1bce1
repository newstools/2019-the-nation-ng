Olakoko Sustainability Project is supporting cocoa farmers with funding, training and quality crop protection insecticides for improved output and support for the economy. The project manager of the Olakoko Sustainability Project, Mrs Mopelola Fabunmi said the cardinal point of the project is to improve the lives of cocoa farmers in their host communities. She spoke at the third edition of Olakoko Farmers’ Day held at Igbara-Oke, Ondo State. According to her, the total wellbeing and welfare of cocoa farmers is key in ensuring that they produce improved cocoa products. She said: “We train and encourage our farmers to diversify so as to have something to lean on during the cocoa off-season. We have also added nutritional and health benefits of food to our training pack.” She noted that since its commencement in 2016, the Olakoko Sustainability Project which now operates in 17 local government areas of Ondo, Osun, Ogun and Edo states, have certified over 8,000 farmers on Good Agricultural Practices. She said that the project is keen on ensuring that cocoa farmers take good care of their farms in order to get good quality cocoa beans; therefore the Project links farmers with sources of good crop protection products such as fungicide, insecticide, and herbicides which are approved by authorised bodies such as Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN). She enumerated achievements of the project to include rebuilding four classrooms at Oke-Osin community in Atakumosa West Local Government Area (LGA) of Osun state to help children of cocoa farmers get good education in a conducive environment; providing school learning materials to children of cocoa farmers; renovating an abandoned borehole water project in Ifedore LGA of Ondo State, and organizing free medical medical checkup for cocoa farmers.
