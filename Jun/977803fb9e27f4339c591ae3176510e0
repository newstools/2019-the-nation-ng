American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola, has bidded farewell to 126 fresh graduates with a call on them to change the world with the knowledge and skills they acquired while in the university. It was the 11th time the university would be holding such event. The graduands comprised 89 and 37 first degree and post graduate degrees. AUN President, Dr Dawn Dekle, said: “AUN has given you the superpowers of service leadership, teamwork, critical thinking, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement. This is all you need to succeed in life, and you will be more powerful than others by continuing to develop these capacities. If you do, not only will you change the world, but you will enable a world of change.’’ The event also saw the keynote speaker and a member of the House of Representatives Nnenna Elendu-Ukeje being conferred with Doctor of Humane Letters (honoris causa). Nnenna  said: “Our country is starving and in desperate need of fresh ideas, clear heads with unjaundiced vision and a youthful, purposeful leadership. I implore you to embark on a leadership renaissance that will redefine our nation’s identity.” A graduating student, Nitaranda Alexander, who studied Information Systems, said: “I was admitted into AUN in Fall 2015, which marked the beginning of my long development journey. My four years in AUN taught me that I can be more and I should always strive to be better version of myself.” Abdulrahman Godabe, who studied Software Engineering, added: “During my stay in AUN, I made a family of people who kept me going. AUN has a small class size that allows one-on-one faculty and student interaction. AUN has broadened my level of analysis, critical thinking and leadership.”
