General Evangelist of the Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide Prophet Hezekiah Oladeji has urged Nigerians to embrace production in the interest of growing the country’s economy. Oladeji said: “Indeed, for any country to grow, it must be into production. There must be conscious efforts to turn Nigeria into a production economy. We should be able to produce with the avalanche of endowments that God has blessed Nigeria with.” The prophet, who spoke at Erio-Ekiti, Ekiti State, ahead of the yearly weeklong Apostle Ayodele Babalola Power Explosion Crusade, advised that Nigeria could kick-start industrialisation with production in the agricultural sector. He said: “Production should be the pre-occupation of the youths. This will provide solutions to the employment needs of many Nigerians, as well as a means of turning away the minds of the youths from crime.” The cleric, however, advised the youths to always remember the Law of Retribution and so refrain from criminal activities and evil acts. “Youths must secure their tomorrow by shunning crime and criminality. What the youths should realise is that whatever evil or injustice they do to anyone shall surely come back to them in the later years. The youths must use their energies for good things.”
