Tales of the devastation of last Thursday’s heavy downpour in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) which has left behind devastating effects on residents is yet to be over. Following the heavy rain, human disaster was averted in Government Secondary School (GSS), Bwari, a co-educational boarding facility in the FCT. Speaking on the incident, the principal of the school said: “Students of GSS Bwari were on Sallah break. That was just the saving grace, but I am grateful that no life was lost as students were not in the hostel when the rain and the devastating wind occurred.” The Thursday’s downpour which started in parts of Abuja very early in the morning lasted for several hours. When our correspondent visited the school, roofs of about three hostels were completely blown off, the wreckage of the hostels were yet to be evacuated, wet mattresses were brought out so they can dry before the students resume. The school had no electricity supply at the time of the visit to avert accident as electricity poles were broken with naked wires lying on the ground. Chairman, FCT Education Board, Yahaya Mohammed, in the company of Chief Suuy Monedafe and members of FCT Education Board were on ground for an on-the-spot assessment. Mohammed said they have witnessed the situation, which he described as an emergency situation and that they would do all within their capacity to remedy the sad development. Principal of the school, Mrs. Favour Edem, who conducted the board chairman and journalists round the school to see the devastation, thanked God that students were not in the hostel as they were at home for Sallah celebrations. Students are expected to return from Sallah break in a matter of days.
