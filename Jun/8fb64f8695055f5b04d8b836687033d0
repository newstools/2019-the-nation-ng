Multinational professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria Limited has estimated that corruption could cost up to 67 per cent of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030, if unchecked. The Nigerian report of PwC’s 2018 Family Business Survey launched on Monday in Lagos said corruption was associated with lower investment, higher prices as well as barriers of entry for businesses. The result of the survey, which was made available to The Nation, said corruption was one of the top three challenges cited by Nigerian family businesses as militating their personal and business goals. Others are economic environment (70 per cent) and regulation (57 per cent). The Family Business Survey is a global market survey among key decision makers in family businesses within a number of PwC’s key territories. The goal of the survey was to get an understanding of what family businesses are thinking on the key issues of the day. This year’s report with the theme, “Building a Lasting Competitive Advantage Through your Values and Purpose in a Digital Age” saw family business leaders globally reporting robust health, with levels of growth at their highest since 2007. The survey said regionally, businesses in the Middle East and Africa were the most optimistic, with 28 per cent expecting aggressive growth. They are followed by those in Asia Pacific (24 per cent), Eastern Europe (17 per cent), North America (16 per cent), Central/South America (12 per cent) and Western Europe (11 per cent). It, however, said growth among Nigerian family businesses over the last 12 months was lower than the global average, with only 53 per cent reporting growth in the last 12 months against 69 per cent globally. However, 87 per cent expect to grow over the next two years with 40 per cent saying growth will be quick and aggressive against 16 per cent globally.
