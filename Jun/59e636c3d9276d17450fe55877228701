THE National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has called on governments  at all levels to increase education funding, especially basic education. According to the United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world. In a statement on the Children’s Day celebration, NANS President Comrade Danielson Bamidele- Akpan, said Children’s Day is the time to celebrate children because of their importance to the association and country. Said Bamidele-Akpa: “Nigerian children have excelled despite numerous challenges. One prominent instance in recent times is Tanitoluwa Adewunmi, an eight-year-old Nigerian who made international headlines when he emerged a Chess champion. ‘’He is the story of the excellent spirit of the Nigerian child.” Bamidele-Akpa, who reiterated the importance of basic education and its effect on the future of Nigeria, advised the government to reposition the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). He faulted the leaders for failing to represent the message sent by then former premier of the Western Region Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who made massive investment in education by ensuring that about 30 per cent of the budget of the region  was earmarked for education. He expressed displeasure at some governors’ penchant for commercialising public education and failing to uphold Awolowo’s free education legacy.
