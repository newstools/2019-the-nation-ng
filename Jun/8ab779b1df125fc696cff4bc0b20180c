They will next go through their first acid test in the next game when they host Tottenham Hotspurs, who eliminated them in the last UEFA Champions League season. But it will be Liverpool that will raise the curtain of the season on the 9th of August, when they host promoted Norwich on the evening of Friday 9 August. The current winners of the UEFA Champions will hope to win the title this time, have come so clos, fighting till the last day of last season. They face Southampton, Arsenal and Burnley in their next three matches. They will however have a tough end to the season as they travel to Arsenal (May 2), play at home to Chelsea (May 9) and then conclude the season at Newcastle on May 17.
