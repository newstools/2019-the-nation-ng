MEMBERS of Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC), Lagos State Command, have sent their condolence message to the management of the national theatre, on the death of its General Manager/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Stella Morounmubo Oyedepo. Oyedepo, 65, died in an accident, along the Benin- Ijebu-Ode express road, while returning to Lagos from an official trip in Calabar, Cross River State. PCRC in the condolence letter dated June 17, 2019 and signed by its state chairman, Apostle Kehinde A. Showemimo, said the death of Oyedepo, whom the committee described as ‘Friend of PCRC’, was indeed a rude shock to them. The letter reads in part: “We received with shock and sadness the recent news of the sudden death of your General Manager and friend of the PCRC, Mrs. Stella Morounmudia Oyedepo, who died in a ghastly motor accident. “It was indeed a rude shock that we can quickly lose such an amiable and pleasant woman. She was a hardworking, friendly and unassuming mother, wife, and great leader. As a staunch supporter of PCRC, she privately facilitated a number of community-based development activities and even in her official capacity. “The entire Lagos State PCRC commiserates with the husband, family members, management and staff of the national theatre. Kindly take solace in the fact that Mrs. Stella Oyedepo lived a life devoted to improving human socio economic advancement as evidenced in the outpour of emotions that followed her demise.
