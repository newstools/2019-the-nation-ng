The Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE) has begun an indefinite picketing of the Abuja office of the Investments and Securities Tribunal. The union said it would not stop until the chairman of the tribunal, Isaiah Idoko-Akoh, accedes to its demands. It asked the chairman to honour the agreement it signed with the union last year. AUPCTRE National President Benjamin Anthony, who addressed reporters, urged the chairman to stop sending its members on secondment. He said: “We have been on the issue of staff welfare with him since last year and the Ministry of Labour and Productivity called us and we endorsed an agreement, a mutual agreement. After six months, he refused to adhere to that agreement. “We will start picketing this place. We will picket this place everyday to ensure that the management calls us to a roundtable to see how we can sort out the workers’ issues. “We will continue to protest, and it is going to be an indefinite protest. We will fight this till the President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) comes back from Geneva, Switzerland. Then, we will pack ourselves and meet him and we will report what has happened here.”
