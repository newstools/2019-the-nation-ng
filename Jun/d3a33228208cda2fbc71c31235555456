The Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has advised the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB), the Petroleum Administration Bill and the Petroleum Fiscal Bill. NEITI said the bills, if passed into laws, would enable institutions to be more operative and  accountable. NEITI said: “The incoming National Assembly should look at all pending issues in terms of legislation, institutional, process and others as contained in the NEITI reports and use them as tools and oversight in their various equipment with both companies and government.” Its Director of Communication and Advocacy, Dr. Orji Ogbonaya, in an interwiew with The Nation, on phone, said there was the need to automate the process of data gathering and analsisis in the organisation. He said NEITI’s Executive Secretary, Mr Waziri Adio, would be a leading delegation to the Transparency Initiative (EITI) conference in Paris, France this week. Also to attend the conference is NEITI’Chairman, Prof Bolaji Onosanya.
