We all dream of that one person with whom everything makes sense. It is with this person that everything just clicks. And when we see couples experience this, the desire is even stronger. The flip side to this is that, we start to settle for way less than what we deserve. Here are ways to know when you have found someone deserving of you. 1.    He or she will support you in all you do no matter what. 2.    He or she will take time to listen to you: nothing feels good as someone who listens attentively and understands you deeply. 3.    You are a big part of his or her plan. It will be evident. When your partner talks about the future and you are included in it, know that he or she does not intend to let you go anytime soon. 4.    Trust is vice versa. Being in a relationship with someone who trusts you and whom you also trust in return can be very liberating. 5.    When you want to share every single detail of your life and experience with him or her, no matter how horrible or sweet, then you have found the one. 6.    In turn, when your partner never uses your weaknesses against you but encourages you no matter what, he or she sure is likely to be your soul mate. 7.    When your happiness means his happiness or your sadness means her sadness and vice versa, you two share a much deeper connection and are likely meant for each other. 8.    There are no exiting boundaries in your love. Laugh all you want but until you can comfortably fart, snort, bite nails etc, in front of your partner, then you haven’t connected as soul mates. 9.    When you solve issues together and help each other grow, you probably are soul mates. 10. When you look at your life, your partner will be the one constant that will always lift you higher, make you the best version of yourself and hold your hand down the road to success. When you find someone who has these qualities, hold on to the person and do not let go.
