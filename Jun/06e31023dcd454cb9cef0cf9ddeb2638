A Professor of Fish and Environmental Biology, Oyebamiji Fafioye, has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government for declaring June 12 a public holiday in memory of late politician, Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (M.K.O.) Abiola and the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election. Fafioye said the late Abiola, aside being a pilar of democracy, was a man who encouraged and promoted scholarship by sponsoring academic fellowship for many people. The academic stressed that the Federal Government should also establish a foundation to sponsor academic fellowship in memory of the late politician and business mogul. The professor, who acknowledged the late politician while delivering the 89th inaugural lecture of the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, said Abiola sponsored his postgraduate Transport fellowship. He added that the gesture contributed greatly to the height he has attained today in the academia. Fafioye decried the high cost of fellowship programmes, insisting that if a foundation is established to provide fund, it would motivate lecturers to go for fellowship. The academic urged state and federal governments as well as public-spirited individuals, like the late Abiola, to establish foundations that would cater for fellowship programmes for lecturers. Delivering his lecture, titled: Fish and Water: The Conjoined Twin Resources for Healthy Human Living and Viable Environment, Fafaioye said Nigeria and other West African countries lost $1.3 billion annually to unreported as well as unregulated fishing.
