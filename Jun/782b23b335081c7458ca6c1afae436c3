The Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) Annex, Alagbon Close, Ikoyi, Lagos, Murtala Mani promised, on Friday, to restore the glory of the unit. Mani told reporters that the necessary machinery has been set in motion to achieve this objective. The AIG said that he had returned about 40 files of cases sent from different state police commands to Alagbon for action. He said the parties involved are satisfied that justice had been done in their cases. He said if a party to a case has no confidence in a State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), he is not sure whether the person will also have confidence or trust in the FCID Alagbon. He said: “We are the same police.” Mani also said that effort was being made to deploy as many professionals as possible to the  fingerprint section to elevate it to global standard. He recalled how the annex made significant breakthroughs in otherwise complicated criminal cases including the arrest of the suspected brains behind the recent killing of Igwe Stephen Nneji Obuneme Nwatu Ibe I of Ogbozine Akpugo, Enugu State. Sections at the annex include: General investigation, Inter Police, Central Criminal Registry namely Finger Print Unit and Latent Unit. Other departments inlude: Forensic Analysis, Police Special Fraud Unit, Homicide, Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Special Enquiry Bureau, Anti-Human Trafficking, Legal for Prosecution of cases and Special Squad.
