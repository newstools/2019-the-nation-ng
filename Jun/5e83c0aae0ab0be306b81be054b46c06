THE camp of Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, is in high spirits ahead of the governorship election scheduled for next year. This is on account of the endorsements the governor has enjoyed lately, even from the least expected quarters. Many of the politicians in the state who have axe to grind with the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and suspect a crack between him and Obaseki, are trying to take advantage of the situation. Their loyalty is motivated by personal gains, hence the same people who are singing hosanna to Obaseki today can call for his crucifixion tomorrow. For instance, not a few observers were shocked that one of those who announced the formation of APC but later defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and worked against the interest of the ruling party in the 2015 and 2019 elections, recently visited the governor to pledge loyalty to him and castigate those he said had fought godfathers in the past but are now asking the governor to send hefty cheques to them. But checks conducted by SENTRY revealed that the real motive for the politician’s visit is that he wants to benefit from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s largesse the governor is attracting to the state to develop palm oil plantation. It was no surprise that after castigating the unnamed godfather allegedly disturbing the governor, the flamboyant politician said that he too has a big palm oil plantation and that when the CBN releases the largesse, the governor should not forget him. Of course, the governor and his team are savoring the endorsements which they hope to use when the going gets tough. Knowing the advantages the endorsements could give the governor, the PDP is urging its members to exercise caution.
