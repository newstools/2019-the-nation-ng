The Super Eagles were beaten 1-0 by the top-ranked African nation, Senegal in their last preparatory game before the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The behind-closed-doors friendly was held at the training pitch of the Hotel Mercure in Ismailia on Sunday evening. Barring an injury, everything is pointing to the fact that Daniel Akpeyi is now the Super Eagles first choice goalkeeper as he got the nod from manager Gernot Rohr to start ahead of Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Francis Uzoho. The trio of Kenneth Omeruo, Troost-Ekong and John Ogu lined up in central defence in a 3-5-2 formation while the midfield contained Jamilu Collins, Obi Mikel, Wilfred Ndidi, Alex Iwobi and Samuel Kalu with Odion Ighalo and Samuel Chukwueze started in attack. Everton midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye, who captained the Senegalese, netted the game winner in the 30th minute, which ended the Super Eagles eight-game unbeaten run. The three-time Africa champions, who were held to a goalless draw by Zimbabwe last weekend, begin their Africa Cup of Nations campaign against Burundi on Saturday, June 22. (Allnigeriasoccer)
