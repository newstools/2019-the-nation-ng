Former Ghana international John Paintsil says tactical discipline on the pitch will play a huge part in how far the Black Stars progress at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). In Egypt, the West Africans will be on a mission to end their historical woes at the continental championship, having made the semi-final of the last six tournaments but failed to lay hands on the ultimate reward. They have been pitted against Cup holders Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau in the group stage. “I think with determination, hard work, confidence, teamwork, respect, the coach being there for the players and players being there for the coach, [the team will be successful],” said Paintsil to TV3. “In terms of discipline [on the pitch], it means keeping their positions right, those who need to recover should recover, the team shape must be accurate; not left-wing going [forward and] left-back [also] going. “If the coach asks them to keep shape, they must keep a shape – they understand these terms.” “So with all these, everything will come right with them but if they lose focus, if they lose discipline on the field, they can get punished.”
