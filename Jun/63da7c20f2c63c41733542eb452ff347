President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with families of the victims of Sunday nightâ€™s bomb blast near a viewing centre at Mandarari, Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State. A statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the President sent his condolences to the government and people of the state. He decried the heinous act, stressing that perpetrators of evil acts have judgment awaiting them, not only from man, via the long arms of the law, but also from God Almighty. Buhari urged security agents to sustain surveillance in all theatres of security challenges, considering the unconventional methods deployed by terrorists to harm innocent and unsuspecting victims. The President praised emergency response workers and humanitarian organisations. He prayed that God will grant the souls of the departed eternal rest and comfort their families.
