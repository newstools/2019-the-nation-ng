Award winning singer Simi has told those monitoring her for pregnancy signs to mind their business. She spoke at the weekend, at the much talked about FalzTheBahd Guy concert, which held at the Eko Hotels and Suites in Victoria Island, Lagos. Rumoured to be dating Falz before she married Adekunle Gold, Simi and Falz performed their hit song, ‘Soldier’ at the event. However, just before the duo broke into another song, Falz asked Simi to share the big news with her fans. In her response, Simi asked Falz and other womb-watchers to mind their business. The music concert also featured artistes like YCee, Niniola, Seyi Shay, Dice Ailes, Skiibi, and Ice Prince, among others. It was produced by Livespot 360 and Bahd Guys Entertainment, the record label founded by Falz.
