MTN Nigeria flagged off the 13th edition of 21 Days of Y’ello Care at its head office in Ikoyi Lagos recently, with fanfare. MTN Y’ello Care, an annual employee volunteerism programme which runs from 1 to 21 June across the company’s footprint, recognises the enormous potential that young people have to drive economic growth and help their communities thrive. This year’s edition tagged: “Creating a brighter future for the youth,” drew participants from far and near. Commenting on the campaign, Esther Akinnukawe, Chief Human Resources Officer MTN Nigeria, who represented the CEO Ferdi Moolman said, “We believe that if we all join forces, there will be a rise in youth empowerment and a decrease in the prevalence of youth unemployment. Our goal for this year’s Y’ello Care programme is to do our part to support young people and help tackle the various issues they face.” Akinnukawe adds, “As the leading mobile operator in emerging markets and given our understanding of the transformative power of digital innovation, we constantly seek opportunities to connect people with technology, so that all our stakeholders can enjoy the dividends of the digital age.  As the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses, we will work to equip our youth with the skills and knowledge they require to effectively prepare themselves for the digital future.”
