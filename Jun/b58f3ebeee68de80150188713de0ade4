Medical Doctors at the Ondo State Specialists’ Hospital in Ikare-Akoko on Friday abandoned their duty posts, over an attack on one of their colleagues. The doctors, under the aegis of National Association of Government General, Medical and Dental Practitioners, (NAGGMDP), Ondo State Branch, are protesting shoddy security arrangement and unavailability of emergency drugs and consumables in the hospital to treat the patient. Dr. Adeke Funsho was allegedly stabbed severally by miscreants, who took laws into their hands, following a face-off between the doctor and a Pharmacy Technician at the hospital. It was gathered that the Pharmacy Technician on duty invited some hoodlums to deal with the doctor for suggesting that she was slow in releasing the packs to the patient’s relatives. Trouble started when the doctor challenged the Pharmacy Technician for failing to release the packs to one of the patient’s relatives, who later died because of the delay. The female Pharmacy Technician was infuriated by this action and she invited some miscreants to the hospital to deal with the doctor and anyone on duty. The doctors are pressing home their demand for the need to guarantee the safety of lives of health workers in the hospital, by down tooling. They want provision of adequate emergency care and effective security around the accident and emergency ward of the hospital to prevent future re-occurence. Reacting to the incident, the State Chairman of NAGGMDP, Dr. Oluwafemi AINA said appropriate government agencies have been contacted to take necessary action to address the crisis. He said, “we have reported the case to relevant government agencies and they are expected to take urgent action”.
