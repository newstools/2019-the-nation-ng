The trio of Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi and Shehu Abdullahi arrived at the Super Eagles’ training camp in Asaba on Wednesday afternoon for the preparation of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Their arrival swelled the list of the players in camp to 23. The team’s camp was officially opened on Sunday at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba but Musa, Iwobi and Abdullahi were given extra days off from camp by the team’s head Coach Gernot Rohr. NationSport had earlier reported that Musa and Abdullahi were permitted to skip training in the last three days to enable them to finish their Ramadan fasting and celebrate Salah festival with their families, while Iwobi came late to the camp due to his involvement in Arsenal’s UEFA Europa League final against Chelsea in Baku. He scored Arsenal consolation goal in a 1-3 defeat to Chelsea.  However, the duo of Odion Ighalo and William Troost-Ekong are yet to arrive in the camp. A source in the camp told NationSport that Ighalo and Troost-Ekong may join the team today. Ighalo suffered a hamstring injury in his side’s 1-1 draw at Tianjin Teda on May 10 and has not featured in a competitive game for Shanghai Shenhua since his terrible injury. Ighalo resumed full training last Tuesday with the possibility that he will recover very fast before the camp opened for the AFCON preparation but his absence in camp has continued to put doubt on his fitness level for the AFCON with just a few days to kick off. Super Eagles trained once on Wednesday under the guidance of coach Rohr and his assistants. The training session, which was opened for fans and media, started at 4.15 pm.
