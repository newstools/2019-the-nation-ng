The Lagos State Ministry of Education has postponed three public examinations scheduled for this month. They are the  Screening Test into the State Model Colleges and Upgraded Schools (slated for June 3-8), the Basic Education Certificate  Examination (BECE; June 25-July 2) and the Placement Test into JSS 1 in public secondary schools (July 13). New dates have yet to be fixed for the examinations. A statement by the ministry’s Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Adesegun Ogundeji, said the examinations were postponed because schools were yet to adopt e-registration. The statement reads: “The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye noted that the postponement was necessitated by the inability of many schools and private individuals to adhere strictly to the dictates of the new full e-registration system adopted by the Examinations Board this year which has made most of the data submitted incomplete.” According to the statement, the board introduced 100 per cent e-registration to check the activities of fraudsters found to have been extorting unsuspecting parents/guardians. “There is need to clean up the data with a view to bringing every candidate on board thus necessitating the shift,” she said.
