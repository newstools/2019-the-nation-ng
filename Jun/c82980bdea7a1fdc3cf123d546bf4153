The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) highest scorer in the concluded 2019 season Ibrahim Sunusi has dedicated his award to Ibrahim Usman Oguns, whom he claimed contributed immensely to his decision to play football. Sunusi beat Mfon Udoh of Akwa United on disciplinary ground after both were tied at 10 goals each at the end of the regular season and the striker who expressed happiness at his emergence as the best marksman in the league quickly offered to dedicate the accolade to his football father, Oguns who is the head coach of the Ministry of Sports, Nasarawa State football team and the head of Nigeria Referee Association in Keffi, Nasarawa State. “I am thrilled to be declared the highest scorer in the league in just my second season in the NPFL,” Sunusi told NationSport. “I know I am just starting and I will like to dedicate this award to my football father, Ibrahim Usman Oguns who has done a good job to ensure that I take football as a career. He did a lot to ensure that I become a better player and all that I am today was due to him. “I will continue to work harder and I must thank my teammates at Nasarawa United, the coaches, and the management for the support offered to me to ensure that I work under a good environment. I was able to score 10 goals this season and playing all the 22 games without missing anyone. “I could have gone throughout the season without a booking if not for the yellow card I collected against Kada City after I went to complain to the referee who gave Kada City a controversial penalty in the dying minutes of the game. We lost the game 1-2 in Kaduna.”
