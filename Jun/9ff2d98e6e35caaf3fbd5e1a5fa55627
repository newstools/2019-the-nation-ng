FORMER Big Brother Naija housemate, Bamike  Olawunmi, who is also known as Bambam, has expressed her love for fellow former housemate and boyfriend, Teddy A, in a birthday note. Posting the message on her Instagram account with Teddy A’s picture, Bambam said the world is yet to witness the manifestation of the singer’s career strength and how they have gone through a lot together. “Hey handsome (I love that I make you blush), Happy birthday papi, the world is blessed to have a rare beautiful soul as yourself,” she wrote. “It’s truly been a journey we both have been on, one many may never ever understand. “You are hardworking fierce, resilient, stubborn! Consistent yet soo soo tender. My gentle giant, as I so often call you… loving you makes me happy, the world ain’t seen nothing yet, they ain’t fully ready for your manifestation. My heart, my oxygen, my passion I love you daily and truly and will remain your ride or die, your Queen and your favorite song. Happy birthday my king… @iamteddya can we start cashing in already, unbuilt empires await u.” Bambam and Teddy A were housemates of the 2018 season of the Big Brother Naija reality television show.
