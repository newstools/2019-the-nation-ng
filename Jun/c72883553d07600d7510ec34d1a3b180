The police in Enugu State have arrested three suspects for alleged complicity in two murder incidents. The suspects are: Elochukwu Eze, 21, from Ishiokwe Agbani and Michael Ani, 22, of Mgbogodo Agbani, both of Nkanu West Local Government Area. The command also arrested Monday Nnaji of Amodu in Nkanu West Local Government Area for alleged murder. The first two suspects, the police spokesman Ebere Amaraizu said, allegedly murdered a man identified simply as Chidera on June 6. The police said: “It was gathered that the deceased was found lying in a pool of his blood at Amurri Junction. A closer observation revealed machete cuts on his head, hence he was conveyed to a hospital for medical attention. There he was confirmed dead and his body deposited at the Agbani District Hospital’s mortuary for a post-mortem. “Following the incident, Police Commissioner Suleiman Balarabe directed a prompt action and full scale investigations to unmask the perpetrators. This led to the arrest of the two and recovery of exhibits, following their revelations.” The suspects are said to be helping the police in their investigation. Nnaji is said to be helping the police on a “dastardly act in which he gave a machete cuts to the head of Great Nwobodo, which caused his death”. The police added: “It was gathered that the deceased was coming back from school alongside three of his siblings on that fateful day, June 6, on Amodu Ubia Road, when the suspect allegedly committed the act. “Police Commissioner Suleiman Balarabe has directed full scale investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident, which has led to the arrest of the suspect and the recovery of the machete used by the suspect. “Also, the body of the victim has been deposited at District Hospital’s mortuary in Agbani for a post-mortem examination.”
