Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has approved the appointment of a varsity don, Professor Maxwell Gidado, as the Chief of Staff, Government House, Yola. A statement by the Director General of Media and Communications in the Government House, Solomon Kumangar on Monday evening, explained the appointment is with immediate effect. The statement said the Chief of Staff brings over 30 years of experience in lecturing and public service to his new job. It added Professor Gidado was until his new appointment the Dean of the Faculty of Law, Nasarawa State University, Keffi. The new Chief of Staff, it could be recalled, was the Chief of Staff to Mr Bala James Ngilari when Ngilari was the Adamawa State governor from October 2014 to May 2015. Ngillari had been the deputy governor with Murtala Nyako as governor when an impeachment process by the state House of Assembly removed them and Ahmadu Fintiri who was the speaker of the House became the acting governor. Fintiri himself was less than three months later removed from the governor’s seat by the court which faulted the impeachment in favour of Ngilari.
