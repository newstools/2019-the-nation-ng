A member representing Oshodi/Isolo constituency 2 at Lagos House of Assembly, Jude Idimogu, has promised lawmakers are ready to stick their necks for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to move Lagos forward. Speaking at the Assembly complex Alausa, the former PDP member, who returned to the 9th Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), assured the governor will deliver dividends of democracy to the state. “The governor has a lot to do in the state and everybody must be ready to work with him. The House is having confidence in the Governor and we have no doubt for his competence, his competence has given us the confidence that Lagos will work again,” said the lawmaker, the only South Easterner in the Assembly. “As it is, there are many abandoned projects in the state and you can see that works are already going. Everybody will benefit his regime. “He’s a man who has taken the job upon him 100% and for the House, we have shown him total support to move Lagos forward. “Lagos will take a new shape under this new administration. All hands are already on deck.” The Imo- born lawmaker appreciated support of his constituents even when he left the PDP for APC. “I was elected by the people in my constituency for the trust and interest I have shown to serve them. So it’s my duty to return back the goodwill to them by listening to their needs and move a motion to benefit the constituency. “I can assure that all the bad roads will be attended to, a lot of things will come up and that’s the progressives we are talking about.” Continuing Idimogu said: “God has been helping me to do my best while I was in opposition and I believe joining the ruling party is to enhance my productivity to serve and be a good lawmaker in the state. “And so far so good, I have been enjoying the benefit of the progressives under the leadership of Hon Mudashiru Obasa and my colleagues in the House and I believe something new and greater things are coming to the state.”
