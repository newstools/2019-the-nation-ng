Renowned singer Ara (Thunder) is set to release her single, Bojuboju, on June 7. Ara is a female Igbo talking drummer, singer, choreographer and song writer. The release of the audio and video of Bojuboju is coming under the management of Atunda Entertainment which has reiterated its commitment to the development and promotion of budding African artistes. Other artistes under the stable of Atunda Entertainment include Anu the Lady Ekwe, a former beauty queen of Sisi Oge fame, who is Nigeria’s only Ekwe female instrumentalist; Olo omidan bata, Nigeria’s only female Bata drummer and Afe Onikoko, another female potter. However, speaking on the focus of the outfit, Atunda Entertainment disclosed that the organisation is neither a record label nor artiste management outfit. It explained in a press statement that Atunda Entertainment is part of the activation of Motherland Beckons, a developmental organisation founded by the President of La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, Otunba Wanle Akinboboye. The main focus of the organisation is to attract people of African descent and Africans in Diaspora to motherland to be part of its development by investing and experiencing its offerings. As part of this developmental process, African international Music (AIM) Festival was introduced by Motherland Beckons three years ago to provide a platform for its artistes and other artistes in the creative industry to exhibit their talents.
