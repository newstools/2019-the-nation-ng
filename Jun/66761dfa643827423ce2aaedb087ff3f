Repair of the failed portion of Cele-Mile 2-Tin Can Road in Apapa, Lagos, has begun. Hitech Construction Company moved to site on Monday to begin work. Work began from the Berger Suya, Coconut and Tin Can axis, which has become impassable. Vice Chairman of the Presidential Task Team on clearing of the Apapa gridlock Kayode Opeifa said: “The contractor had wanted to commence the repair last week, but exercised restraint. We have been able to achieve orderliness on the road, and this has restored sanity on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway from Cele Bus Stop to Mile 2. With this, connecting Kirikiri town up to Vanguard Newspapers and other parts of adjoining communities have become easier.” Opeifa said with the clearing of the road, it became easier for the contractor to move its equipment to site, adding that once the remedial work is completed, the task team’s job would be made easier. “Every bit of road from all corners is usually filled with trucks. Apapa Oshodi had always been worse from Mile 2 to Port gate in what could be described as real madness. We started work on that axis a week ago. Cele to Mile 2 has now been streamlined and trucks have now been restricted to one lane with traffic management present from Mile 2 to Coconut”, he said. Opeifa said it was sad that most trucks caught in the Apapa-Oshodi axis were export laden vehicles, adding that they are carrying agro-based exports, many of which got spoilt even before getting to the port.
