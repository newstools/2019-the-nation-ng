Associates of former Akwa Ibom State Governor Senator Godswill Akpabio have warned his opponents against making unfounded and unguided statements against the former Senate Minority Leader. The associates, who fingered members of the Ibom Integrity and Servant Leadership Culture Group Initiative for alleged plots to stop Akpabio’s ministerial appointment, warned that all evil plots against him would fail. They urged the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to deal with those engaging in activities inimical to the growth of the party in Akwa Ibom. A statement by Cyril Gabriel Essien and Comrade Emmanuel Amama accused the group of “hatred for the APC and acting a script to see it fail”. The statement reads: “One can only see that the members of this self-acclaimed integrity group hate the party to its marrow. To a discerning mind, they and their cohorts have grumbled for a long time, and have now exposed themselves as those who worked against the interest of the APC in Akwa Ibom State. “We pray they come out in the open wherever they are hiding; let them expose themselves as the Akwa Ibom chapter of the group has done. “They are opposition members in APC garments. If the opposition had won the presidential election, one would not be surprised to see them being offered a ministerial slot. “We know that the party will follow the recent Zamfara example for those discovered to be agents of antiparty activities. They should be brought to book.”
