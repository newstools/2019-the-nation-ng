Staffers of the Abia State Hospital Management Board (HMB) located on Aba Road, on Monday morning, barred its members and management staff of the government establishment from gaining access to the premises in protest of 10 months arrears of salaries. The workers who bore several placards with different inscriptions; “Pay us our 10 months’ salary, is our own different? HMB workers are dying,” etc that portray their anger threatened to down tools if the government failed to clear the backlog of salaries it owes the staff of the agency. They wondered how the state government could turn blind eyes on the welfare of the health workers. Speaking to journalists, spokesperson of the workers and chairman Medical and Hospitals Workers Union, HMB chapter, Comrade Patrick Nwaukwa lamented the pitiable conditions of the HMB workers. Nwaukwa who accused the government of being insensitive to their plights disclosed that most of the staff of the state government agency are finding life difficult, stressing that to cope with family responsibilities including payment of their house rents have become a big challenge on them. According to the union leader who called on the state governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu to end the workers’ grief accused the state government of making what he described as empty promises to them. The Public Relations Officer of the State Ministry of Health, Franca Ekwueme couldn’t be reached for comments at the time of filing the report. The workers, however, said that there is no going back to their protest until the government goes beyond verbal promises to save the workers from the embarrassment that they have suffered from their landlords and people that they are indebted to.
