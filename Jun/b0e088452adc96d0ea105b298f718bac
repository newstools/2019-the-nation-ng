AJAX attacker Dillon Hoogewerf has confirmed he will join Manchester United this summer. The Eredivisie champions confirmed last week that the 16-year-old striker, who also plays as a winger, had rejected their offer of a professional contract to pursue a move abroad. Hoogewerf was quickly reported to be on the way to join United’s youth academy and he announced through an Instagram post yesterday that he is heading to Old Trafford. “We wish Dillon a lot of success,” Ajax’s head of youth Said Ouaali said, when he confirmed the Netherlands Under 16 international’s departure. “We know we have done everything we can to keep him. Ultimately, the choice is up to him and he has opted for a foreign adventure.” Hoogewerf rose through the Ajax youth academy after joining in 2012 and went on to feature for the Under 19s this season.
