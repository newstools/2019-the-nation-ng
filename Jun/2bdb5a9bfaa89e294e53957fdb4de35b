An 18-year-old apprentice has been found dead in Abraka Community in Ethiope East Local Government Area (LGA) of Delta State. The girl, identified as Favour Ogheneyenrohwo, was found dead in a sack, was learning tailoring in Abraka. The deceased hailed from Ughere Community in Ethiope East LGA. A source said the victim may have been strangled as marks were visible on her neck. It was also gathered that the deceased pubic hairs were shaved off after she was murdered last Wednesday. It was learnt the deceased was found in a sack at the Police Station Junction near Bob Izua Motor Park, Abraka around 7:30pm. Delta State Police Commissioner (CP) Adeyinka Adeleke, said the police have begun a manhunt for her fleeing male acquaintance. Adeleke said: “The lady in question was with her sister and she had a call. When she wanted to leave, she told her sister that she was going to visit her boyfriend. “But when her relatives waited for her after a while and couldn’t find her, they started searching around for her whereabouts. The next day they saw her dead body tied in a sack and her boyfriend whom she was said to have gone to visit fled the area. “So it is not a ritual, but a murder case. The physical sign on her body shows in the neck that she was strangulated. Maybe somebody tempered with her neck and threw her body into the bush. Her boyfriend is nowhere to be found. He is on the run.” CP Adeleke said the victim’s corpse has been deposited in the mortuary.
