ASSOCIATION of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (MBCN), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Chapter, has appealed to the Federal Government and the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to review the high tariff imposed on bakers. MBCN Public Relations Officer Mr Nura Musa made the appeal in a statement in Abuja. He said NAFDAC had increased it tariffs on registration by 90 per cent and it could adversely affect their business. “The registration fee for bakery, which was N31, 750 is now increased by 90 per cent, making it N89, 750, while that of registration form, which was N250, is now N2, 500. Also, the late renewal of registration licence of N15, 000 has now been increased to N156, 250,” he said. Musa said production without a Chief Baker that was formally N50, 000 has been increased to N200, 000 and tampering with Hold label, which was N537, 500 is now N3.375 million.
