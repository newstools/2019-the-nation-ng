Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has urged Muslims to put all the lessons they learnt during the holy month into good use, especially in their daily dealings with fellow citizens. The governor said the 30-day spiritual exercise had drawn the faithful closer to Allah. In his congratulatory message yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, the Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) congratulated Muslims in the state and across the country on the celebration of the Eid-el-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan period. He noted that the current situation in the country and across the world had made it imperative for Muslims and followers of other religions to live in love, peace and harmony with one another so that they can collectively confront and arrest the menace of violence and banditry. Fayemi said prayers by the faithful are needed more than before to gain God’s intervention in the affairs of the country. The governor expressed confidence in the powers of God to prosper and keep the country together in answer to the sincere prayers of the faithful. Fayemi, who hailed Muslims in the state for their unflinching support for his administration through prayers, counsel and active participation in governance, also expressed appreciation to the Muslim Ummah for their contributions to the religious harmony enjoyed across the state. He urged followers of all religions in the state to join the government in promoting peace and orderliness and in restoring the core values of honesty, honour, hard work for which the state was renowned. “On behalf of the government and Ekitikete, I congratulate the Muslim Ummah on the Eid-el- Fitr celebration, and pray that God Almighty will accept our prayers and grant all our hearts’ desires, even as He preserves our lives to witness many more celebrations,” Fayemi said.
