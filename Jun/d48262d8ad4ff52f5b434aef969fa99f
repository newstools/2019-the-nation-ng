Operatives of the Nigerian Army (NA) 81 Division on Saturday morning defied the heavy rainfall to undertake environmental sanitation preparatory of its anniversary. The exercise which started at about 7am, saw army personnel under the division cleaning up the Tinubu Square and Idumota Market, Lagos Island, parts of Ikeja, Surulere, Ikorodu and Epe areas of the state. Led by the Chief of Army Standard and Evaluation, Maj.-Gen. Adekunle Shodunke, the team deployed to Tinubu Square cleared refuse dumps and drainages removing all plastic waste obstructing free flow of water. According to Shodunke, the cleaning was done annually across the country as part of activities to celebrate the Nigerian Army Day Celebration (NADCEL). He said the exercise was aimed at fostering civil-military relationship, noting that the army was a responsible institution. He said: “We as part of the society see this sanitation exercise as part of our corporate social responsibility to help clean the environment and make it better than the way it is. “This sanitation exercise took place nationwide. In Lagos, this exercise also took place at Ikorodu, Epe, Ikeja and all other units,” he said. Aside the sanitation, Shodunke said the army will carry out a medical rhapsody within its host communities.
