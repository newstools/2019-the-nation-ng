A FIRM Unicorn will hold its maiden TechMoney and Innovation Summit Africa next week at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka. In an interview, Unicorn’s Chief Investor Relations Officer Dr Ponmile Osibo said the aim of the summit is to provide a platform for tech people across the continent and empower them.  He added that stakeholders in the ecosystem would be engaged during the two-day event to proffer solution to the challenges in the sector and show the way forward. He said the summit would bring together experts in technology, finance and innovation to teach people how technology could change lives, support tech talents and start-ups to get investment and bankable deals, adding that the event would also connect tech leaders in major public and private organisations on the latest innovation to support citizen and customer service delivery. Osibo said stakeholders, especially youths or young start ups, would get free training and networking opportunities to excel in the industry. ‘’The summit is not about us. It is about those in the ecosystem,’’ he added.
