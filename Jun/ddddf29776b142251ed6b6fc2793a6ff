Following the assault on social media influencer, Pamilerin Adegoke, by singer, Peruzzi, hip hop star Davido and On Air Personality Denrele Edun, have intervened. Taking to Twitter, Davido apologized on behalf of Peruzzi, who is his artiste and noted that artistes are also human and react to certain situations. “I apologize to you @thepamilerin on behalf of my brother and Artist @Peruzzi_VIBES he was wrong for putting his hands on you,” Davido tweeted. “But pple need to realize that we Artiste are human beings and we see everything! You said some harsh words too my brother and sometimes this thing dey pain.” Also, Denrele has called on both Peruzzi and Pamilerin to settle the issue amicably. Denrele naarated how the settlement took place at his new club in Bayelsa. “So I invited @thepamilerin &@Peruzzi_VIBES to my club opening in Bayelsa,” Denrele tweeted. “Both arrived at different times. I’ve known Pamilerin for years since we all went to Dubai recently for his birthday celebration; I wanted him to cum thru not only as an influencer but to unwind for a bit! “Peruzzi came down a few minutes after & whilst we were catching up about his great performance d nite before, d Protocol guys called for my attention. We all stepped outside to d car park & drifted apart. “Next minute, I heard d sound of a LOUD SLAP & there wz commotion everywhere. “Dis was no PUBLICIY STUNT! It happened for real. And im rili saddened by dis turn of events! I apolologize to every1 who had to witness dis & I honestly want 2 ask @thepamilerin &@Peruzzi_VIBES to settle this amicably. Off camera. Cos I know it’s brewing hot more than we can imagine.” However, Peruzzi in his apology to Pamilerin, noted that there’s a very thin line between opinion and insult. “Someone else is somewhere feeling hurt because you don’t see that very thin line between opinion and insult,” he said.
