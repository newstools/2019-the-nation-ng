Ahead of the Eid-el-Fitr celebration, the Plateau State Police Command says it has deployed 2,181 personnel across the state to ensure a hitch-free celebration. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Terna Tyopev, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Jos that the deployment of the personnel was to ensure crime detection and prevention during the period. “To ensure a hitch-free Sallah celebration in Plateau, the state police command, on May 31, held a meeting with some religious leaders and other critical stakeholders,” he said. “Part of the decision reached at the meeting is the deployment of 2,181 personnel to detect and prevent crime, as well as control traffic, to ensure peaceful celebration in the state.” The PPRO said the command had placed a ban on the sale and use of fireworks, knockouts, bangers and other explosives during the period. Tyopev also announced that the command had banned the operation of commercial tricycles within Jos and Bukuru metropolis during the period, adding that violators would be made to face the law. He said plans had been concluded to divert traffic during the break to ensure free movement and therefore called on motorists to park their vehicles 100 metres away from the Eid grounds.
