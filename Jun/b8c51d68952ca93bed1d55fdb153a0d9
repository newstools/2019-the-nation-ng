President Muhammadu Buhari lost to Atiku Abubakar in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) because “free money” stopped flowing, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who is also the most senior apostle of Buharism, Chief Gilbert Olokesusi has said. According to him, those who enjoyed free money under past administrations voted against Buhari. To him, it is corruption fighting back. A statement by him reads: “Buhari tried to alleviate the suffering of the masses through his adviser on social investment, We the apostles of Buharism hereby plead for replacement.” “Mr. President lost FCT because the hewers of wood and drawers of water, who form majority of FCT population, did not feel the impact of Mrs. Uwai’s programme. “Another reason is that corruption is fighting back. Most of the yesteryears philanthropists, who acquired their financial greatness fraudulently, have run underground with their monies. The money is no longer circulating, so things have never been this hard in the FCT,” he added. Olokesusi, who described APC as an amalgamation of like and unlike minds, said the party can be united by the ideology called Buharism. He was  confident that the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, would unite the party. “I personally signed Oshiomhole’s nomination form for Ekiti South. We the apostles of Buharism have since placed the Buharism phenomenon on Oshiomhole’s desk; the ball is in his court. “Buharism is the only ideology that can unite Obaseki and Oshimhole his boss…” Buharism is the inevitable future ideology of the APC. President Buhari has a robust cult-like followership which will only vote for a southern presidential candidate under Buharism,” he added.
