An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos on Monday remanded in prison a 26-year-old man, Uchechukwu Okoro, who was accused of defiling a 10-year-old. Magistrate K.O. Doja-Ojo made the order after hearing a temporary two-count charge of defilement brought against Okoro by the police. The court did not take Okoro’s plea. Mrs Doja-Ojo ordered the police to duplicate the case file and send a copy to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. She adjourned till July 3. Earlier, prosecuting Inspector Peace Chukwudi said the defendant committed the offence at about 9:40am on May 16, at Dumping Market area of Lagos Island. Chukwudi said the defendant sexually assaulted the girl by penetrating her with his manhood. “The defendant sent the girl on an errand and used the opportunity to perpetuate the act,” she told the court.
