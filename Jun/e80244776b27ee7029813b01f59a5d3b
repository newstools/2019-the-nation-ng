The World Health Organisation yesterday warned that over 24 million Nigerians may suffer from various mental illnesses, a situation worsened by the dismal number of health institutions and professionals. The frightening revelation was contained in the global agencyâ€™s 2018 report released at a workshop on health reporting during emergencies in Yola. The document observed that with the prevalence of mental disorder among Nigerians put at 12.1 per cent, many people from the North East might suffer one form of disorder or the other.
