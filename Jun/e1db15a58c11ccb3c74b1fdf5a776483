The senator representing Osun East and Chairman of Senate Committee of Legislative Compliance, Babajide Omoworare, has felicitated with Muslims on this year’s celebration of Eid-el-Fitr. The senator urged Nigerians to uphold the lessons of Ramadan in their daily activities. In a congratulatory message in Ile-Ife, Osun State, by his media aide, Tunde Dairo, to celebrate the successful completion of this year’s Ramadan, Omoworare urged everyone to sustain the spirit of the holy month to make the society better for all. He said: “As we end this year’s Islamic fasting month, I felicitate with Muslims on the successful end of the fasting period. It is, however, important that we sustain the lessons of Ramadan beyond the holy month. “Chastity, unity, love, consecration, godliness, sharing, faith and worship, which characterised the month of Ramadan, are essential for a better Nigeria and must be sustained by all.” Omoworare urged Nigerians not to relent in their prayers for a peaceful, progressive and united country beyond ethnic and religious lines. He said: “A greater and prosperous Nigeria is possible, if we will not give up in our dedication to God and service to humanity.” The senator also advised Nigerians to give more support to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), led by President Muhammadu Buhari, to take Nigeria to the Next Level. He assured Nigerians that the party will not relent in giving good governance and quality leadership direction at all levels to Nigerians to fulfil its electoral promises.
