The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Regional Director for Africa, Cynthia Samuel-Olonjuwon, has called for more participation of African countries in the Global Youth Initiative by emulating Nigeria. Samuel-Olonjuwon spoke when the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, William Alo, led the Nigerian delegation to her office at the Palais des Nation, Geneva, Switzerland. The ILO regional director congratulated Nigeria for being one of the five countries that are members of the Global Youth Initiative, which brings together about 20 United Nations (UN) agencies to support the Global Youth Employment Agenda. She said: “I used Nigeria to encourage other African countries to be part of this initiative. It is not surprising because Nigeria is the first country where ILO physical presence was established. “It is the only country in Africa that is part of the Global Youth Initiative. It is not surprising that Nigeria is hosting the Global Youth Employment Forum in August 2019. We appreciate the commitment of the President and people of Nigeria to the hosting right and wish the country a successful event.” Samuel-Olonjuwon said ILO’s Director General Guy Ryder would be physically present to declare open the Global Youth Forum in Abuja, the nation’s capital. She added that Nigeria, as a member of the Global Youth Initiative, would strategically use the opportunity for itself and Africa. Alo expressed Nigeria’s readiness to host the Global Youth Employment Forum. He said: “The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, has approved the hosting of the event by Nigeria. An inter-ministerial committee has been set up involving all relevant government agencies and series of meetings and planning are ongoing towards the success of the event.”
