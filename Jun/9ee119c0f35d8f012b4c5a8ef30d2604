There was panic on Tuesday among lawyers and workers in the Bayelsa State Ministry of Justice following invasion of the stateâ€™s High Court complex by hoodlums suspected to be cultists. It was gathered that the armed cultists stormed the complex at night and fled after operating unchallenged for hours. It was learnt that the hoodlums burgled the offices of the State Chief Judge, Justice Kate Abiri and Justice Nayai Aganaba. They were said to have carted away case files, computers and other legal materials fueling speculations that the operation was designed to frustrate some high-profile cases. It was learnt that justice Abiri, whose office was vandalised, judges and lawyers in the state were shocked by the incident. The judiciary workers especially cleaners, who reported to work were said to have been devastated at the sight of the ransacked offices. The police were said to be investigating some employees of the judiciary working at the complex. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Butswat Asinim, said the matter was reported to the police. He said the police were investigating the development to unmask identities of persons behind the crime.
