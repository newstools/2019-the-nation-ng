Valencia have officially completed the signing of Barcelona goalkeeper Jasper Cilllessen, who will be able to play Champions League football as a starter next season. The Dutchman has been an excellent back-up for the Blaugrana since joining from Ajax in 2016, but he was clear about his desire to play regular football and he will get that at Valencia. Although it has not been confirmed, everything is pointing towards current Los Che shot-stopper Neto replacing Cillessen as Marc-Andre ter Stegen’s back-up at the Camp Nou. According to a number of Spanish reports, including AS and Dario SPORT, the two deals will be done separately and completely at slightly different times for equal amounts of money to help out Valencia in financial fair play. Neto will move to Barcelona before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, while Cillessen’s deal will be officially completed after the start of the 2019/20 fiscal year on July 1, helping Valencia bank the €30 million transfer fee in the recently completed season before sending that money right back officially part of next season.
