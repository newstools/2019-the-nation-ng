A POPULAR church with headquarters in Lagos, which emphasises its African roots, is at daggers drawn with its spiritual leader for refusing to quit the position after surpassing the new mandatory retirement age set by the church. Ironically, the clergyman was said to have been part of the body which some years ago took the decision that made it mandatory for the spiritual leader of the church to quit once he clocks the age set for retirement. But he was said to have protested when he was reminded recently that his time was up. He made it clear that he would not step down because he was yet to hear from God that he should do so. He said he was appointed by God and that only the one who appointed him can tell him that his time is up. SENTRY recalls a popular minister of God who took on the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in the wake of the controversy that church leaders, whether founders or inheritors, who have spent 10 years in the supreme bodies of their churches should resign. “What nonsense. How can you ask a man you did not employ to resign? It doesn’t make sense.” To some other leaders of this popular church, their request to their spiritual leader makes sense. It was a collective decision of everybody, including the spiritual leader some years ago. The matter is said to be tearing the leaders of the church apart as they are now divided into two camps: those in support of the continued stay of the spiritual head and those who are against it. Pastor Enoch Adeboye caused a stir in the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in 2017 when he stepped down as head of the church in Nigeria in line with the nation’s Corporate Governance Code. The code, proposed in May 2015, limits the number of years heads of corporate organisations can stay in office, with churches falling under the non-profit making category.
