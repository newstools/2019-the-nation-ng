The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has said Nigeria is on course in harnessing young people’s potential and empowering them for sustainable development. UNFPA Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist Mr. Pashe Dasogot, who disclosed this in Abuja, said “2019 is a celebratory year for UNFPA as it marks 50th Anniversary of its establishment and 25th Anniversary of International Conference on Population and Development. Dasogot said: “One of our greatest achievements recently in Nigeria is that we have been trying to sensitise the government to harness the demographic dividends. “Today, Nigeria has launched the road map to harness the demographic dividend, and has come up with interventions to invest in young people in areas of employment, entrepreneurship, health, education and youth empowerment. “It is an African Union (AU) road map agenda, initiated in 2016, which designed a road map in 2017 on the theme: “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investment in Youths”, directing all countries to launch and implement the road map.’’ Dasogot said young people in Nigeria formed about one-third of its population, who are very energetic and of high intellect. He highlighted some interventions that would help Nigeria harness the potential of young people for sustainable development to include the “Not Too Young to Run Bill’’ passed by the President, which aimed at reducing the age limit of people seeking political offices in Nigeria. Others include continued support for family planning, to meet the needs of young people, capacity building, job creation, participation of young people in policy making and legislature, among others. Dasogot said: “Our President has promised to take Nigeria to a greater height. We are confident that with support from donors, development partners and UN agencies such as UNFPA, we can achieve our mandate.”
