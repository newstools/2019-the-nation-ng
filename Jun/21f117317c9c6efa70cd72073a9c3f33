As government is toying with the idea of state police, the founder of the Ekiti Youth Movement, Lanre Ajegbomogun, has said crime control is doomed to fall short, if the Federal Government fails to adequately equip the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). He also called for the expansion of the National Social Investments Programme (NSIP) to capture more Nigerians. In a statement issued in Lagos, Ajegbomogun said the Federal Government should aggressively continue and expand its NSIP to capture more Nigerians wallowing in poverty, unemployment and others, while the 36 states need to be made to buy into the NSIP at their level. According to the youth leader, that the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari could criticize the NSIP, shows that the programme is only a drop in the ocean and it needs to be radically expanded to accommodate millions of jobless youths and the poor. While lauding Vice President Yemi Oshibajo empowerment programme for women and traders, he said same should also be extended to the youths that have graduated from schools, who are without jobs.
