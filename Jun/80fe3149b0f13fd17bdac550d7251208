The Senior Staff Association of Statutory and Government-owned Companies in Nigeria has congratulated the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA) for earning top ranking as the best Federal Government’s agency in the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business policy. OGFZA was honoured with the ranking plaque at a high profile ceremony in the Presidential Villa chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Osinbajo is the chairman of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC), which oversees the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business (EDB) policy and does the ranking of compliance with the policy by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government. In the latest ranking, OGFZA came first among 44 MDAs. Congratulating the Managing Director of OGFZA, Mr Umana Okon Umana, on the ranking of OGFZA as the best agency of government on the implementation of the policy, the senior staff described the honour as “recognition of the efforts and contributions made so far by the organisation in areas of implementation of business policies in Nigeria under your capable leadership.” The association pledged “good working relationship” with the leadership of OGFZA to further strengthen its operations.
