The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has rescheduled the verification of pensioners and Next of Kin (NoK) of all federally funded parastatals, agencies and institutes in the Southeest, Southwest, Northeast, Northwest and Northcentral regions as well as the Federal Capital territory (FCT) under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS) . The Directorate said the rescheduling of the exercise is to enable it review the outcome of the verification exercise in Lagos and the Southsouth Region and restrategise towards ensuring greater efficiency and improved pensioner satisfaction. According to the statement, the exercise will recommence from the second week of July. PTAD noted that the new dates and venues for the exercise will be announced on June 28. While apologising for any inconvenience the postponement might cause pensioners, the directorate said the postponement will not affect monthly pension payments.
