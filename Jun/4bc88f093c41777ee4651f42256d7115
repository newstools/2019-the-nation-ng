FORMER Super Eagles skipper, Kanu Nwankwo has expressed confidence in the ability of the current crop of players in the Super Eagles to return home with the AFCON trophy as the competition begins this weekend in Egypt, AOIFootball.com reports. Kanu, who was recently appointed CAF Ambassador to the biannual tournament, said that he was happy with his new CAF role but would be more excited if Nigeria clinches the competition in the Arab nation. “I feel happy and excited about the opportunity to serve and give my own input in the competition and hopefully it would be a good outing. I believe we have the ability to do well in the competition. I am sure we can make it to the final and by God’s grace we will win it,” Kanu said. Having missed the past two editions of the Nations Cup, the three-time champions will begin their quest for a fourth continental crown today when they face debutants Burundi in their opening Group B clash in Alexandria.
