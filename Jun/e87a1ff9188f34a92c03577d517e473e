As part of activities marking the coronation anniversary of Onitetiku-Owode Otta Awori Oba Wasiu Ogungbayi, no fewer than 40 persons will receive certificates in different field of business life. They were trained by the Oba Onitetiku-Owode Help Foundation. Oba Ogungbayi congratulated Governor Dapo Abiodun and his deputy Mrs Noimat Salako Oyedele on their strides so far. The monarch appealed to the governor to construct Owode-Alade-Agoro/Ijoko roads. This, he said, would ease the suffering of the electorates. “This road if constructed will triple the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Ogun State in our area alone and also create more jobs for the people,” he said. Oba Ogungbayi stated that if Owode-Alade-Agoro road is not quickly constructed, it may affect the construction of Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway”
