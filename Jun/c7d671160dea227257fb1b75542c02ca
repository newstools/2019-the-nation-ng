As Kaduna State Police Command paraded him alongside 71 other suspects, Alhaji Musa Ibrahim alleged to have raised false alarm leading to the death of three persons has denied the crime. The police arrested Ibrahim for raising false alarm that his sureties who came looking for him from Lagos, were kidnappers, which led to mob action and death of three persons. “Alhaji Musa Ibrahim who deals in oil business has a problem with one of his business partners and was reported to the Lagos State Police command. He was invited and later detained. From information available to us, his friend went to secure his bail and he was released to them and they became his Sureties. After appearing at the Police station on two occasions he disappeared. The Sureties were later invited and asked to produce him, it was then that they informed the Police that they knew his residence in Kaduna, and they promised to take the Police there. “When they got to Kaduna, they went straight to his house, while the Police were still perfecting their documents at the Command’s headquarters. When he sighted them, he sensed their mission and quickly jumped into his car and drove off. The Sureties followed him in their own car and blocked him before Kawo flyover bridge, he (Alhaji Musa) jumped out of his car and raised false alarm that people running after him are kidnappers. Mobs descended on the Sureties. We were able to rescue the Sureties but the driver was burnt alongside the vehicle,” the Police claimed. But Alhaji Musa Ibrahim in an interview with newsmen at the Police Command Headquarters said, “I never raised any false alarm. On that day, I just saw some people trailing me with a car. They crossed my car and dragged me into their own vehicle. It was people who were passing by that suspected they might be kidnappers, and then they raised alarm and blocked the vehicle. But I never called them kidnappers.”
