NOLLYWOOD actress and producer, Omoni Oboli, is in the season of giving. The mother of three made it known that having been taught that givers never lack, has resorted to the act of her picking randomly to bless those in need of monetary help. Though she is yet to reveal how long the monetary assistance will last, she posted on Tuesday on her Instagram handle, one of the lucky winners who have gained from her kind gesture. Captioning the post, “I believe God blesses us, so we can be blessings to those around us,” she said. “A good woman taught me that givers never lack; so I stay giving and trust me, it works! I give to people around me in real life. Those close to me can testify. I also believe that people I interact with here are part of my community. Stay glued guys! Stay commenting and liking all posts! Winners being picked from every post. I’m picking at random.” Omoni is presently in Dubai with her colleagues Chigurl, Chioma Akpotha, Uche Jombo, and Ufuoma McDermott on the #DubaiFaceOff trip.
