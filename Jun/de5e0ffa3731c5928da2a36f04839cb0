An official of the Mayo-Belwa Local Government Area, Aliyu Isah, who spoke to our correspondent on the phone, said, “The only hostel of the school has just been destroyed. It has been consumed by fire.” Explaining further, Aliyu Isah who is the clerk of the Mayo-Belwa Legislative Council, said, “We have not determined the cause of the fire yet, but we put it to electricity malfunctioning. It is sad because the students will now have to be dispassed. This is the only hostel block standing after the first of two hostel blocks was similarly destroyed by fire last year.” He could not be specific on the number of affected students, but he said they would not be less than 80, but that nobody received physical injuries as a result of the fire.
