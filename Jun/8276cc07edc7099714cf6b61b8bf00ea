An official of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) was on Thursday night allegedly strangled to death by two of his colleagues in Onitsha, Anambra state. The deceased, identified as Emeka Ojei, a Senior Road Marshal Assistant, was reportedly killed for attempting to expose certain corrupt practices against one of his assailants in the office. The Nation gathered that the deceased was armed with damaging corruption allegation he intended to report at the Corps headquarters in Benin before he was killed. A staff of the commission who spoke to the Nation on condition of anonymity said the prime suspect had appealed to the deceased not to go ahead with his plans, adding that it was his refusal that necessitated his actions. He said the officer was struggling with his mobile phone with the deceased when the other colleague joined and held him on the neck until he gave up. He said, “Emeka is one of the officers privileged to be working on a report on a corruption case to be sent to the headquarters in Benin. “As he was about going to deliver the report, his oga called him back, insisting he shouldn’t go. But he refused. “His oga dragged him with his phone while another officer joined him. He was struggling with them over the phone when they strangled him to death.” The Nation further learnt that the case had been lodged at the Police Area command, while the Unit Commander and his accomplice had been arrested. The FRSC Public Relations Officer in the state, Pascal Anigbo, confirmed the incident. “The incident happened around 7pm in the office. I don’t have the full details of the incident now,” he said. When contacted, the commissioner of Police, Mustapha Dandaura, said he was just coming back from a trip and was yet to be briefed on the matter. “I’ll get back to you as soon as I get the details from the Area commander,” he said.
