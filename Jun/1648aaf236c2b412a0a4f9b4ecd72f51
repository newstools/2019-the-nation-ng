Despite the pronouncement of June 12 as Democracy Day, there was no celebration of any sort in Niger state. Governor Sani Bello and his Deputy, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso are out of the state with no activity lined up to commemorate the day in the state. Workers and students stayed indoors due to the public holiday while business owners opened for sales. Political activities are yet to pick up in the state because the governor is yet to constitute the executive council. A statement by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Strategy, Alhaji Isah Bala Ibrahim, on behalf of the Governor felicitated with Niger residents and Nigerians on the celebration of Democracy Day. The statement explained democracy as a system of government has restored the fundamental rights and liberties enjoyed by the people and brought development closer to them. It noted that sustained democratic governance have brought comparative improvements in various sectors of the economy adding that the present administration is not resting on its oars in ensuring it meets the yearnings and aspirations of the citizens. The statement further commended President Muhammadu Buhari for changing the date of the Democracy Day to June 12 in the interest of peace and national reconciliation.
