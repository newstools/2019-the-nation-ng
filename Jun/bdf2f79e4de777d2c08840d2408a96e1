Lawan’s only opponent, Ali Ndume, seemed unperturbed on Saturday by the endorsements for the APC official candidate. He said he was confident of winning on Tuesday. His words: “Well, I’ve said before that I am not looking for endorsement but looking for votes on election day. “You know clearly that there is the difference between endorsement and election. You would recall too that in 2015 that story of endorsement was canvassed. He had the endorsement but what happened on the floor of the Senate was different. “This kind of thing has been there all along, we have seen endorsements against several elections. We are there already and shall become past in question of hours from now.”
