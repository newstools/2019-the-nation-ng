The immediate past Commissioner for New Cities Development in Cross River State, Dr George Ekungu, has called for support for Governor Ben Ayade’s signature projects, which he said would be to the benefit of the state. Ekpungu said in Calabar that Ayade has so far shown that he is a man of great intellect and unique ideas and his style of governance is different from usual. He said the signature projects of a superhighway and a deep seaport in Bakassi, among others would lay a strong foundation for the industrialisation of the state. “The twin projects of the deep seaport and superhighway were conceptually and strategically well thought out by the governor. These Projects conceived by the governor are, with the benefit of historical hindsight, a timely intervention aimed at correcting a planning or infrastructural abnormality caused by the British Colonial administration. “
