Following the intervention of the Ondo State government, World Wrestling silver medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye; Commonwealth Games gold medalist, Aminat Adeniyi, three-time African champion, John Emmanuel and other top athletes have decided to represent the Sunshine State at the forth-coming Governor Dickson National Wrestling Classics billed to hold in Yenegoa, Bayelsa State from 23rd to 30th June, 2019, NationSport reports. Other medal hopefuls including African champions, Bisola Makanjuola and Sunmisola Balogun; Commonwealth bronze medalist, Bose Samuel; Africa cadet champions, Esther Kolawole and Mercy Adekuoroye had hinted NationSport of their plans to represent Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministries (MFM) as Ondo State government did not show concern towards the wrestlers and are not ready to sponsor the team to Bayelsa. However, Head Coach of Ondo State Wrestling team, Akuh Purity informed NationSport that the athletes have now decided to do the state proud once again after meeting with the Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Saka Yusuf-Ogunleye, who assured the team of maximum support for the championship. “The commissioner has spoken with us and explained so many factors happening in the state. He assured the wrestling team that the governor will do us well and that we should exercise patience. So have decided to represent the state but we are waiting for their promises. “On our side, we are already preparing and everybody is in shape for the championship. We have upcoming wrestlers that will be given opportunities too. We will be going for the Classics with about 35 wrestlers, both male and female,” Purity told NationSport. No fewer than 500 athletes and officials from different states and wrestling clubs around the country are expected in Yenagoa for the Classics which will also be used to select athletes that will represent Nigeria at the 12th All-Africa games in Morocco and the 2019 World Wrestling Championships in Kazakhstan in September.
