Except a miracle happens, former Governor of Imo state, Rochas Okorocha may not be part of the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly on Tuesday. Consequently, he will not be directly involved in the making of the leadership of the Senate. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will be meeting on Tuesday to look at the Court rulings. The 9th National Assembly will be inaugurated on Tuesday and the election of leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives is also expected to emerge at its first plenary session the same Tuesday.
