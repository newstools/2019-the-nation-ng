After leading his team to unbeaten run in the group stage of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland, Senegal’s coach, Youssoupha Dabo believes his lads must finish their calculations when they battle Nigeria’s Flying Eagles in the round of 16. Senegal became the first team to qualify for the knockout stage after their unbeaten run in Group A where they defeated Tahiti 3-1 and a convincing 2-0 win over Columbia but Nigeria qualified as the best loser in Group D to set up a knockout battle against their West African foe. “Senegal has achieved its first goal. But the commitment remains the same within the team. With cleaver games, finished the calculations. You have to win or go home, “he told footsenegal.com. He added: “This is not the time to relax even if we have reached the first goal, now we must continue to compete and advance match by match. “At this phase of the competition, the opponent will always be difficult to play. We have to be ourselves, to keep playing our football,” Dabo said. The coach however, said that he relies on the quality of midfielder Dion Lopy. The Oslo FC of Norway star netted the second goal in Senegal’s 2-0 win over Columbia will be crucial against Nigeria and the coach has charged the player to raise his game against the Nigerian side. “Dion Lopy is a box-to-box player with great potential, but he could have done better by releasing the ball faster for the benefit of his teammates,” said the coach at APS. “By dropping faster, he can quickly project forward and be at the reception of several offensives of his team, said Dabo. “I scream at him sometimes, but I know he has to let go of the ballast as his teammates so he can give the full measure of what he can do,” said the young tactician.
