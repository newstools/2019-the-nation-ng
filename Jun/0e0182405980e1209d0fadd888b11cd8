Registration for the 2020 edition of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon opened Monday, June 17, 2019, with intending participants paying a fee according to a statement signed by the organisation Director of Communications and Media Olukayode Thomas. Upon the payment of the registration fee of N5, 000 for the 10km race and the full marathon, intending participants can register online atwww.lagoscitymarathon.com or collect registration forms at the Marathon Office, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos or any of the Access Bank branches nationwide. Thomas said foreigners who intend to participate in the 2020 edition slated for February 8, 2020, will pay a registration fee of $US100 (One Hundred United States of America dollar only). Thomas said the first four editions of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon was free but a fee is being introduced from 2020 so as to comply with the IAAF requirement which stipulates that all top label races must charge a participation fee. He said 10 per cent of the registration fee paid will be donated to five charity organisations selected by members of the public and other stakeholders. “Payment of registration fee will enable us to raise the standard of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon to the standard of other world-class marathons like the New York Marathon, Dubai, London, Chicago, and others. “It will also attract many tourists to Lagos, thus boosting the State’s economy; especially in the areas of hospitality, transport, sales of arts and crafts and the positive stories they leave with will attract genuine investors to Lagos State in future,” Said Thomas.
