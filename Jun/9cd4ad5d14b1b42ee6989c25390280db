The Lagos State Government on Thursday reminded Lagosians of plans to shut Akanni Doherty Street by the popular Ashade, in Ikeja from Friday night. The closure will last till morning of Sunday June 30, 2019. This closure according to the earlier release signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Taiwo Olufemi Salaam is to allow the contractors of the project, CCECC and Devine Gate LTD, relocate and interconnect the 700mm diametre public water main in the Ashade vicinity, in preparation for the on-going Nigerian Railway Modernization Project. “The two-day closure will also be used for excavation across the said road, the laying of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, and backfilling and compaction of the road,” the statement stated. It, therefore, urged all motorists who ply alternative routes as the road would be inaccessible as a result of the construction exercise. “Motorists and the general public are hereby urged to cooperate with the State Government by using alternative routes around the area during the period, to ensure hitch-free traffic flow,” the statement added.
