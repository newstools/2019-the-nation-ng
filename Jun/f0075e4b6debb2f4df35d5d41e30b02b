Anthony Joshua posed for an inspirational photo with former president Barack Obama last Friday. The pair were invited to speak at an event in Spain hosted by SAP and Joshua could not pass up on the opportunity to get a picture with the 44th president of the United States. Joshua posted the photo to his Instagram page on Tuesday with the caption: ”CEO Summit. A long way from where it all started.” The former heavyweight champion is currently preparing to make his comeback after he suffered a shock defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr earlier this month. It was the first defeat Joshua has tasted since turning professional and saw the London fighter lose his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles to the unfancied Mexican. The 29-year-old has the chance to reclaim his world titles in a rematch later this year with Joshua’s second encounter with Ruiz expected to take place in England. However, Tyson Fury’s manager Frank Warren has urged Joshua to consider his options before fighting Ruiz again. ”I do have my doubts,” Warren told BBC 5 Live’s Sportsweek. ”I don’t think he should take the rematch. Maybe he should take some time out and regroup, I don’t know. That’s his decision. But he’ll be fighting a guy who next time will have more than five weeks’ notice and go into a proper training camp. ”I’m not going to say or make any predictions about the shape of his body, but he’s got fast hands and I believe he’s got Joshua’s number. He’s taken Joshua’s best shots and he knows he has the punching power to do damage to Anthony Joshua.”
