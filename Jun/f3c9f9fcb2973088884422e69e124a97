Efoghae Friday, 21, confessed to have stolen the underwear belonging to Madam Adekoya, who resides in a three-bedroom flat on 15, Olorunsogo Street, Basiri, Ado-Ekiti, the state capital.

The suspect said one of the two pairs of pants belonging to Madam Adekoya was stolen and delivered to the men. Speaking with The Nation, the old woman said: “I know Friday very well as he usually comes to assist me in doing some domestic chores at my home. To show appreciation to him, I used to give him meals. I never thought he could do this. “I had washed my pants and put two of them out to dry at 3 a.m on June 10 at the corridor of my house. But when I went to remove it the next morning, I found out that one was missing; then I raised the alarm. “After series of investigations, a relative who suspected Friday, called him and urged him to confess. The relative promised not to be angry with him. He did eventually confess to stealing the underwear and that was when we invited the police to arrest him. “When he was arrested, he took the police to the house of three boys, claiming that one of them asked him to fetch the underwear and promised to give him N2,000,” she said. The suspects were transferred from Irewolede Police Station to the New Iyin Police Station on Bank Road, Ado-Ekiti. A relative of the old woman, who did not want his name in print, urged the police to prosecute the suspect and make him provide the pant stolen. He also urged the police to charge the suspects to court since they had admitted of have committed the crime.
