Operatives of the Bauchi Police Command have arrested 41-year-old Abdullahi Mohammed, who allegedly faked his own kidnap to defraud his family. Also arrested was his accomplice, Haruna Saidu, 35. The Nation gathered that Mohammed’s brother, Tijanni of Sabon Fegi Lafia in Nassarawa state, had reported at the Police Area Command in Nassarawa  that his elder brother had left home to Kano state  for business, only  for him to call and informed them that he has been kidnapped along with others while on business trip to Zamfara. Mohammed was said to have told Tijjani that his abductors demanded N10 million for his release. The demand was later reduced to N1 million after negotiations. Parading the duo at the Bauchi command headquarters, police spokesman Kamal Datti Abubakar, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said: “On May 12, Tijjani Mohammed reported at the Police Area Command, Nasarawa that his elder brother, Abdullahi called that he was kidnapped along with others while on a business trip to Zamfara. Abubakar said: “The abductors demanded N10 million for his release, however, after negotiation with the alleged kidnappers, it was reduced to N1 million.
