Human rights lawyer Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the recommendation for state police. He urged the President to give instructions towards amending the constitution to actualise it. “President Buhari should go beyond mere rhetorics, presidential directives and sheer populism, by instructing government officials to immediately draft and send an executive bill to the National Assembly for amendment of sections 8, 214 and 215 of the Constitution.” He believes state police will “give Nigeria a new security lease of life.” “I will then do a piece wholly dedicated to applauding him for taking a gargantuan and major step towards devolution of powers and restructuring of the unworking Nigerian project,” Ozekhome said.
