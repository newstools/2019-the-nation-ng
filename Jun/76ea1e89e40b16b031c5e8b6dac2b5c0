They were said to have shot Sakiru Bashiru dead during a clash by factions of the tricyclists’ union in Alagbado. According to AIG Lawal Shehu, their arrest on April 10 followed an April 2 petition accusing the suspects of malicious damage and murder The squad, he said, recovered five locally made double/single barrel and four pump action guns; 23 live cartridges, two cutlasses, an expanded cartridge and assorted charms. Oladipupo told reporters that they were members of the Bakare Taofeek-led OPC in the area, saying their pal was to take over the tricycle park at Moshalashi Bus Stop in Alagbado. But he washed his hands of the tricyclist’s death. The AIG also paraded two men, Jimoh Hassan and Kazeem Abiodun, who allegedly kidnapped and killed Musibau Saheed, 45. Jimoh said the victim was killed for not granting them access to a site at Ado-Odo, Ota. “We went to a site in Ado-Odo, Ota with policemen. When we got there, we met some boys who were fighting and claimed they were looking for someone nicknamed Long. I was running to meet them, but before I got there they had injured someone already. “I said they should call the police that followed us there but they refused. After a while, they took the victim on a bike and left and I do not know where they went to,” he said. Also on Monday, the AIG warned criminals to keep off Lagos and Ogun states, especially during the Sallah holidays. He said criminals masquerading as herders to in the zone would be dealt with.
