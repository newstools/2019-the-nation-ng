The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has announced it will be focusing more on drug prevention, sensitisation and education of the citizenry as a new strategy for the prevention of drug trafficking and abuse. The NDLEA said this at a pre-event press briefing at Abuja to flag-off the commemoration of 2019 International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking with the theme ‘Health for Justice: Justice for Health.’ The Chairman/Chief Executive, NDLEA, Col. Muhammad Mustapha Abdallah, represented by his Chief of Staff Femi Amos Oloruntoba, said the NDLEA had realised it must do more to curb and prevent drug abuse in the country. “Rather than just hosting a grand finale where all talks and goodwill messages are given, the agency this year will carry out all-inclusive education and sensitization programmes in Abuja and at lower scale in our state commands across the country,” he stated. “One other objective of our new approach is to improve our outreach to the vulnerable groups. “Therefore, we shall be carrying out drug prevention, education and sensitization targeted at the following identified groups of our population. “The theme for this year’s commemoration of International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking addresses three broad issues: “Drug dependent persons having access to the treatment they need, connecting drug prevention, social inclusion and protection, and building knowledge for justice and health.” The NDLEA is in partnership with MTN through MTN Foundation to accomplish the sensitization programs among the identified groups of the population. The targeted groups include secondary and tertiary schools, market people, farmers and hunters, members of IDP camps, and people at motor parks spanning from Wuse to Abaji from June 20th to the 26th.
