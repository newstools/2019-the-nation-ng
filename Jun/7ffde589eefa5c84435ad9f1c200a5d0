Nigeria’s leading marketing and brands summit/awards, MARKETING EDGE Awards, has gone live on electronic billboards in Lagos. The high-tech innovative billboards are part of strategic moves to boost the brand equity of the IMC twin event. Some of the strategic locations include, but not limited to Eko Bridge, Ojuelegba, Ogba, Allen Avenue, Victoria Island, Marina, Festac, Apapa and Surulere among others. According to the Publisher/CEO Marketing Edge, John Ajayi, preparations are in full swing to accord the 2019 edition all the pomp and pageantry the great annual event deserves. He said: “All hands are on deck, and preparations are in full swing to make this year’s event a lasting experience for creative and hardworking practitioners and stakeholders. “We assure you it’s going to be one of the most remarkable IMC industry encounters and conversations would be held around it post-event.” Ajayi explained that no award ceremony touches the heart of the IMC industry, celebrates and encourages creativity like MARKETING EDGE annual Awards. “Ours is no longer a mere award ceremony; it has become a tradition and an experience that IMC professionals look forward to. Call it an annual IMC festival of creativity if you like. We are fully and strategically on top of our game to celebrate creative excellence at this year’s event. There’s going to be nothing like it.” The 2019 awards committee hinted that it has added more engaging categories for inclusiveness, and is ready to take a holistic look at IMC industry. The jurors, it said, will assess every entry professionally and dispassionately.
