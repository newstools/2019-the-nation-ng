There was jubilation in Enugu state on Saturday as governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi finally settled the age-long inter-communal hostilities between Oruku and Umuode communities in Nkanu East Local Government Area, as the leaders of the two communities signed agreement on land ownership and boundary delineation at the Government House, Enugu. The two communities had been in communal dispute over land ownership for more than two decades leading to persistent civil unrest despite interventions by past administrations. Ugwuanyi, who on several occasions had visited the hitherto warring communities on peace interventions, promised that his administration will resolve the crisis in line with its peace and grassroots development initiatives. Announcing the final resolution of the inherent issues that were responsible for the conflict, shortly after the agreement was signed, the Permanent Secretary and Chief Administrative Officer to the Governor, Barr. Emma Ugwu, said the development was “consequent upon series of conciliatory meetings between the parties at the instance of His Excellency, the Governor of Enugu State.” He added that Ugwuanyi delightfully congratulated the people of Oruku and Umuode communities, especially their leadership and representatives for their contributions towards the “consensus building project” and the realisation of peace in the area. The governor also acknowledged and appreciated the sacrifices made by good-spirited indigenes of the communities in ensuring the success of the peace initiatives.
