The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, has reserved ruling on the Preliminary Objection Raised by counsel to Governor Samuel Ortom   of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP’)   Samuel Ortom, praying the tribunal to strike out the petition of the All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) governorship candidate, Emmanuel Jime. Jime is challenging the return of Ortom as governor of Benue State at the tribunal. PDP and INEC are joined as second and third respondents in the petition. At the resumption of pre-hearing trial over the weekend,  Ortom, who was represented by Edward Ashiekaa SAN, urged the tribunal to strike out certain paragraphs of Jime’s application on the ground that they are offensive. Ashiekaa stressed that entertaining the petition would amount to waste of time. He urged the tribunal to strike out same. INEC and PDP did not oppose the application. INEC, PDP were represented at the tribunal by E.O.B Offiong SAN and Chris Uche SAN. However, Jime’s lead counsel, Sunday Ibrahim Ameh, who opposed the preliminary objection, also filed   a 19-paragraph counter affidavit.
