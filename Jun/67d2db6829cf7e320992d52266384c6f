The People’s Democratic Party Youth Network (PDPYN) in Bayelsa State has cautioned governorship aspirants, including a former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Timi Alaibe, against causing crisis in the party ahead of the November governorship election. The Secretary-General, James Oputin, said the youths were worried that activities of some aspirants was affecting the existing unity and strength of the party. Oputin said PDPYN observed sponsored articles in newspapers desperately trying to create a wrong impression of a non-existing strife within the PDP. According to him, the aspirants behind the sponsored articles claimed to be “preferred candidates” of political leaders in the state to resolve the phantom crisis. He was shocked that some so-called ‘leading aspirants’ surreptitiously sponsored articles designed to malign the leadership of the PDP by portraying them as weak and losing grip of its dominance of Bayelsa politics. The president, therefore, urged the aspirants  to note that the PDP, which some of them abandoned when they were needed most in 2015, and which graciously admitted them back, was strong enough to win with or without them.
