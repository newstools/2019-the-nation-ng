The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has granted Green Energy International Ltd (GEIL), operator of the Otakikpo Marginal Oil Field, an embedded licence for a  40 megawatt (Mw) power generation plant. GEIL’s Chairman, Prof Anthony Adegbulugbe, in a statment, said the licence is sequel to the company’s application for power generation licence. This is to enable it to utilise its gas resources for power generation as part of its commitment to the Federal Government to use the gas from the field for power and domestic gas projects. GEIL which had earlier on secured a generation Licence for 12Mw, increased its projected power generation capacity to 40Mw following the increase in associated gas that will be produced from enhanced oil production during the second phase of the Otakikpo field. In addition to providing electricity for the its field power requirements and access to electricity for its host communities (Ikuru town, Asuama  Ayama Ekede,Ugama Ekede and Asu Oyet), the 40Mw power plant will provide power to the Otakikpo Industrial Park which will be sited in Ikuru town in Rivers State.
