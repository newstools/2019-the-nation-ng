Just as notable entertainers and Nigerians are calling for the investigation and likely prosecution of Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has said it cannot interfere in the allegation against him. It will be recalled that Busola, the wife of a musician, Timi Dakolo, had alleged that Pastor Fatoyinbo of COZA raped her twice when she was a teenager. However, Fatoyinbo has denied the allegation and threatened to take legal actions against Busola. While reacting to the development, CAN President, Supo Ayokunle, said the body does not interfere in the running of churches. His media aide, Oladeji Adebayo, noted that CAN only concerns itself with serving as an intermediary between the church and the government. “I am sorry CAN does not intervene in how churches are running. Churches belong to denominations and these are the two bodies that regulate how pastors run their ministries, not CAN,” he told New Telegraph. “CAN deals with inter religious matters and stands between the church and the government.”
