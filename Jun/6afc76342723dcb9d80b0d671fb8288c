Chariscoopers has announced plans to host another session of its highly intense career master class session tagged Career Mastery Certification Programme. The announcement was made by the company’s representative who confirmed that the decision to organize the July edition was as a result of the positive impact recorded at the maiden edition which held in June 2019 and was handled by Tunde-Success Osideko, one of the company’s external consultants. Osideko, who is a distinguished HR professional, said the company was very keen on adding value. He said: “We have seen from the feedback we have been getting that this session is as valuable as we wanted it, hence our decision to begin another which will hold in July. At the last one, we exposed participants to the nitty gritty of building a career and what to look out for. “We touched extensively on how they can become aware of their importance as integral parts of the economy, assess their abilities and play out their strengths. “There was a mock job interview which helped participants better understand what employers look for. We are excited about the next edition and certain it will be worth the time of every attendee”. One of the participants of the maiden edition, Ibukun  Owolabi spoke about her experience at the training. “I am glad for the insights, practical and applicable thoughts and learning points. I am now ready and equipped to focus on my career. I highly recommend this programme for organisations and individuals hungry for career growth’.
