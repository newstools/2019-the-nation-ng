Coalition of Niger Delta Concerned Youths (CNDCY) has said that stoking the embers of regional differences does not help the cause of the Niger Delta or build true nationhood. In a statement, CNDCY said the recent statement credited to the Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) on the issues regarding the suspension of the broadcasting license of DAAR Communications, owners of African Independent Television, AIT and Raypower Radio, the group may have decided to tow a divisive line. Responding to the group’s statement that “DAAR’s suspension alludes to the claim that the Buhari administration is hostile to the people of Niger Delta,” the group said such a comment on a basic regulatory matter “is hollow. Maybe PANDEF needs a reminder of the law establishing the NBC.” On the case of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, the group said, “PANDEF seems to have forgotten that there were weighty allegations over Onnoghen’s superintending of affairs of the state and judiciary, which necessitated his suspension. It said description of such a matter as “a rabid rape of the Constitution” is laughable and nothing short of blind conjecture.”
