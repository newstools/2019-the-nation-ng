A twelve year old girl was swept off by flood waters in Okpanam community on Thursday after heavy rains which lasted several hours. Parts of Asaba the Delta State capital and its environs, were also submerged by flood, including Direct Labour Agency road. The busy dualised Okpanam road was taken over by a torrent of red muddy waters, causing traffic grid lock. Also, residential buildings along Junior Staff quarter road from Summit road were flooded. The premises of the Delta Broadcasting Service (DBS) Asaba were submerged by the flood, sacking the workers from their offices. However, the embattled contractor and some of his staff workers were seen at the DBS at the Okpanam road end. Some of the workers lamented their offices have been taken over by the flood. The staff who pleaded anonymity, said most of the equipment of the broadcasting station have been destroyed by the flood. He appealed to the State Government to expedite actions on the storm drainage project as the incessant flooding is hampering the efficiency of the station. Although the identity of the 12 year old girl has not been ascertained as at the time of filing this report, an eyewitness said the victim lives in the Redeemed Church road. He said the victim unknowingly stepped into an open drain filled with flood waters and got swept off.
