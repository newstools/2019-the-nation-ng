JUNE (2) Green  things Green thoughts Green flames Of the first fires   Green imagination of the rain Which wrote the book of the river With its liquid lines and cursive phrases And the moss-maned mountains whose lofty eyes  Perused the pages just as joyously literate As its school of enthusiastic shoals From the turbulent capers in the nascent heights To the twilight slide into the waiting sea   All so green in June’s jolly jazz The friendly fire of the flame tree whose Wick-long charm enthralls the sun before their quiet draft Into the red army beneath the boughs  Green sweat In the moonless sky of the farmer’s night The leafy canopy over heaps of rising tubers The leguminous lingerie of weeded furrows   Green intimations, all so green Behold your month, oh Offspring of the Rain Count its days, divine its deeds Share their blessings with our universe of being
