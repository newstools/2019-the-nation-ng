The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the Customs administration of neighbouring Republic of Benin have finalised the technical aspects of connectivity and are set to sensitise stakeholders tomorrow on the business process and the inherent benefits in the project. Connectivity between both Customs administrations is expected to achieve ease of doing business, promote trade, prevent revenue losses and curb smuggling across their common borders. The new initiative, said to be a step further in the ECOWAS Alisa project, is expected to be launched towards the end of this month. NCS spokesman Joseph Attah said the move will impact greatly and positively on the fortunes of trans-border trade actors in both countries. Attah, a Deputy Comptroller of Customs, said: “Automation of manifest of imported goods into both countries under the connectivity regime will be captured for Customs declaration in both countries. “What we mean is that whatever declaration you make in either country will be known by the Customs administration of the other country. It will be impossible to now make a declaration at one end and later change or adjust earlier declaration in the other country to avoid arrest or payment of appropriate taxes. “This addresses the possible incidents of duty evasion through insincere declarations or attempts to hide and smuggle a prohibited item into the country. Whatever you are declaring on the other side is electronically transmitted to this side, and vice versa, and will form the basses for you assessment. “It becomes impossible to change declaration concerning the consignment. By this, we shall be preventing smuggling electronically.”
