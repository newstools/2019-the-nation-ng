The Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party, ANDP, on Friday urged media practitioners and other stakeholders in the sector to uphold the sacred tenets of objective and ethical journalism. The National Chairman of the party, Charles Ogboli, who made this known through a statement in Abuja said that a publication by a media platform misrepresented the words of the Chief of Army Staff, General Buratai, to mean that soldiers in the war front against Boko Haram insurgency were lazy and unserious. This, according to him was incorrect and mischievous at best. He explained that General Buratai never indicted soldiers for being unserious and lazy in their fight against Boko Haram, rather he encouraged them to give more and do their very best in the fight against insurgency. According to Ogboli, “The party believes General Buratai must have been quoted out of context in order to portray the Chief of Staff and Army as a whole as incompetent. “The party posits that publications casting the Army Chief in bad light is against National interest and aimed at weakening the morals of the soldiers.” He therefore urged Nigerians to discountenance such mischievous publications, support the Military and give them maximum encouragement having sacrificed their lives for the benefit of this country.
