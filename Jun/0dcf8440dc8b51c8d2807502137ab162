Emzor Wellness Club hosted over 1,000 school pupils drawn from 24 schools across the state to a fun party to make this year’s Children Day unforgettable. It held at Rafiu Jafodo Park, Shasha – Egbeda, Lagos. There were lots of fun activities on the menu for children, including competitive games, dances and bouncing castles.  There was also plenty to eat and drink such as popcorn, cotton candy and juices among others. It kicked off at 11:30 am with opening prayer, national anthem, and introduction of the schools; followed by a welcome address by Mrs. Chinelo Umeh, Regulatory Manager, Emzor Pharmaceutical. At the end of the keenly contested inter-school dance competition, winners who emerged were Ugochukwu (Effort Will School), Maryrose (Cedrus Academy) and Chimamanda (Davey Academy). This was followed by a general dance with Emzor mascot, Maxwell. The fun continued as representatives of each of the 24 schools battled it out in spelling Bee competition. Again, Efforts Will School represented by Joseph produced the winner and he was rewarded with a brand new Bicycle. Other winners included Adebayo (Epitome School), Okoye (Start Right School), and Sarumi (Landmark Montessori School). In tune with its Wellness and health message, Emzor with its worm expeller brand, Zolat reinforced the need for children ensure they are dewormed.
