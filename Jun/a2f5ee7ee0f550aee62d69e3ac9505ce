An influential group in the All Progressives Congress (Lagos State chapter), Jide Sanwo-Olu Youth Movement, has congratulated Mr. Tayo Ayinde on his appointment as the Chief of Staff to the new Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Speaking during an extraordinary meeting of the group in Lagos, its leader, Ambassador Iyabo Ipaye, described the appointment as “well deserved and putting a round peg in a round hole.” Flanked by other leaders of the group comprising party stalwarts of the APC at the grassroots level, including Mr. Korede Sanya, Akin Ogundokun, Wale Erinle and Samson Ayeni, amongst others, Ipaye expressed confidence that the former Director General of the Sanwo-Olu Campaign Organisation would bring to bear his rich experience in public and party affairs in the discharge of his responsibilities.
