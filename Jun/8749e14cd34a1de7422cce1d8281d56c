An Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court Monday remanded an Islamic cleric, Abdulsalam Salaudeen, 43, in prison custody for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl (names withheld) in a mosque. Salaudeen, resident at No. 16, Awoyemi Street, Ikotun, Lagos is facing trial for allegedly defiling the child in his Arabic school. Prosecuting state counsel, Ms T. Olanrewaju-Dawodu, told the court that Salaudeen committed the offence on December 22, 2018 at the premises of Olorungbebe Mosque at No. 15, Palace Road, Igando, near Lagos. Olanrewaju-Dawodu said that Salaudeen, popularly called ‘Alfa’, was caught defiling the child through the footage of a hidden camera which was installed within the premises of the mosque by suspicious individuals. When the charge was read, the defendant pleaded not guilty. Following the defendant’s ‘not guilty plea’, the prosecution requested the court to remand him in prison custody. Justice Soladoye granted the request of the prosecution and ordered the defendant remanded in prison custody. She thereafter adjourns the matter until October 14 for trial.
