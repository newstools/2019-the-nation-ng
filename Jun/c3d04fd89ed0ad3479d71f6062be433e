MTV Base’s Slayed or Shade is set to return on July 2. The show, hosted by MTV Base VJ, Sammy Walsh, returns for a third season of fashion evaluation and ‘shady’ drama. The show will be aired on MTV Base DStv Channel 322. Speaking on the new season of the show, Sammy Walsh said: “I can’t believe that the new season is almost here! The team and I have worked extra hard to make this third season extra special for the viewers. If you thought our guests from former seasons had no filters, wait till you meet this season’s guests! It’s a double dose of slay and shade and I know everyone will love it.” The new season will feature everyone from Men’s Style Blogger, Dr. Akin Faminu, to Nollywood actress, Lilian Afegbai, as well as a number of other fashionista favourites. Speaking on the process of putting the show, Solafunmi Oyeneye, Senior Channels Manager, said: “After two successful seasons, we really wanted to do something special with this third season. We went back to the drawing board to see what was working and what we could improve on. The result is a show that I couldn’t be more proud of and I’m sure that when our viewers see what we’ve put together for them, they’ll be very pleased.”
