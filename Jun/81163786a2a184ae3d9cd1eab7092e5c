The Abia State Police Command on Monday declared one of its officers, Sergeant Collins Akpugo, wanted for his alleged involvement in the killing of one Chibuike Onuoha. Akpugo, reportedly killed a man identified simply as Onuoha at Isiama Afara-Ukwu community in Umuahia North Local Government Area, following an argument. This led to protests and the burning of a police patrol vehicle in the area by angry residents. A statement in Umuahia, the state capital, by the commandâ€™s spokesman Geoffrey Ogbonna, a Superintendent of Police (SP), said Police Commissioner Okon Ene placed a reward of N500,000 bounty on the suspect. He urged anyone with useful information that could lead to the arrest of the killer cop to contact the command to get the financial reward. Ogbonna said the command took the decision after the expiration of a five-day grace given the erring police officer to submit himself for disciplinary procedure. The police spokesman said the gun the sergeant used to commit the act had been recovered by the investigating team. The arm was reportedly abandoned at his hometown in Uturu. It was gathered that though the police commissioner had visited and condoled the family, they demanded that justice be done on the matter. Ene assured the family that the command would make sure that justice is served.
