The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) In Kaduna State on Sunday alleged that, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was under pressure to tamper with election materials  in the March 9th, 2019 governorship elections in the state. The allegation was contained in a statement by the party’s Publicity Secretary in Kaduna State,  Abraham Alberah Catoh. According to the opposition party, ”We have received credible information that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is under intense pressure to tamper with election materials used for the conduct of governorship elections on 9th March, 2019 in the State. “We are drawing the attention of the world, Nigerians and the people of Kaduna State in particular, to note the attempt by the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) and the government Of Kaduna State Tyo coerce INEC into tampering with electoral materials. “In as much as we do not want to question the integrity of INEC, we wish to state that the eyes and ears of our teeming party faithfuls/sympathisers are wide open in all INEC offices spread throughout the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State and the State INEC Headquarters. “We advise INEC not to do anything that could tamper with the fragile peace reigning in the State, as any attempt to do the bidding of undemocratic external forces will be resisted by the public whose mandate was earlier stolen. “Please note that while we would not want to say anything on the petition before the Tribunal, we wonder why the people, who claimed to have won the governorship elections, would be putting pressure on INEC to tamper with the voting materials in their favour. “The eagle eyes are watching and keeping vigil on this undemocratic and crude attempt at coercing INEC officials into embarking on a dangerous mission. We are raising this alarm, to remind INEC that vigilance is the keyword going forward to ensure that electoral materials under its custody are not only safe but unhampered with in any shape or form,” Catoh said.
