Kano state government has canceled the annual traditional Sallah event, Hawan Nassarawa, slated for tomorrow Thursday 6th June, 2019, for security reasons. After security meeting that was held between Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje with all the security agencies, concerning all Sallah celebrations, as it is usually done, there was intelligence report for the fear of breach of peace during the upcoming event. It is clear to all that, Governor Ganduje is a peace-loving leader, who doesn’t toy with safety and security of his people and all other citizens living in Kano. For this reason and as a result of the intelligence report, the state government is not relenting, and it declares Hawan Nassarawa canceled. After the security meeting the Kano Metropolitan Emirate Council was duly informed about the terrifying intelligence report and the cancellation of Hawan Nassarawa. People should move and feel free in these days of Sallah celebration and beyond.  As every measure for the state to remain peaceful is taken with all seriousness.
