Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi II on Saturday replied the query issued to him by the Kano State government over allegations mismanaging N3.4 billion by the Emirate Council. The acting secretary of the Kano Emirate Council Abba Yusuf said Sanusi could not be held responsible for alleged fund misappropriation since he was neither the accounting officer nor the council secretary. Yusuf also said at the time Sanusi was installed as emir in 2014, the Emirate Council had only N1, 893, 378, 927.38, an amount far lesser than the N3.4 billion the Kano State anti-graft Commission said was mismanaged between 2014 and 2017.
