SUPER Falcons’ manager Thomas Dennerby was left angered by match officials after the twice-taken a penalty saw his side lose 0-1. ‘If I give you my honest feelings, they’ll probably send me home, so it’s better I don’t say anything,’ Dennerby said in his post-match press conference. ‘My players are heroes. Of course, I’m disappointed by the result, France is a really good team and don’t need support from anybody to win games. The girls were fighting so well, they followed the match plan and it’s getting destroyed by people that we’re not so happy with.’ New rules state that goalkeepers only have to have one foot on the line at penalties. The video assistant referee has already played a big part at the Women’s World Cup and the match official was a key figure in the outcome of France’s win over Nigeria in Group A on Monday night. France star Wendie Renard was given the opportunity to retake a penalty after missing the first time around with the score level. Referee Melissa Borjas awarded a spot-kick after consulting VAR and adjudging that Viviane Asseyi had been taken down by Ngozi Ebere – who was shown a second yellow card for the challenge. Renard stepped up and smashed the penalty against the post, only for VAR to once again fall in favour of tournament hosts France. Nigeria’s goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie was just inches off her line before Renard struck the ball and Borjas ordered a retake, showing a yellow card to the shot-stopper.
