Five University of Lagos (UNILAG) students were yesterday re-arraigned before an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court for the alleged gang-rape of their 17-year-old colleague. Moboluwaji Omowole, 19, Chuka Chukwu, 19, Peace Nwankama, 19, James Aguedu, 20 and Josephine Osemeka, 20 were re-arraigned on an amended five-count charge before Justice Abiola Soladoye. They pleaded not guilty to the defilement of a child, permitting defilement of a child, procuration and sexual assault. The prosecutor, Dr Jide Martins said, their re-arraignment was informed by the development that emerged from the February 26 testimony of the complainant. In the amended charge, the defendants were alleged to have committed the offence sometime in 2017 at UNILAG, Akoka, Lagos. According to Martins, “Omowole, Chukwu and Aguedo sometime in the month of January and sometime in the month of February 2017 defiled the complainant by having unlawful sexual intercourse with her. “Chukwu sometime in January 2017 at 25, Shobande Street, Akoka, Yaba, Lagos knowingly allowed Omowole to defile the complainant by having unlawful sexual intercourse with her. “Nwankama, Aguedo and Osemeka between January and March 2017 were into the procuration (obtaining) of young girls for the purpose of defilement. “Osemeka sometime in January 2017, in UNILAG, sexually assaulted the complainant by kissing her,” he said. The first defendant counsel, Adebisi Ademuwagun asked for an adjournment to enable him prepare his client’s defence. He said his action was informed by the fact that the penalty for the offence is life imprisonment. The other defence counsel, R.A Oshodi, Mr O. C Aigbangbee, O. C Fapohunda and Ken Edechime, aligned with Ademuwagun’s submission. Justice Soladoye granted their request “in the interest of fairness”. She adjourned till October 15.
