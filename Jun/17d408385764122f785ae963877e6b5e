Anthony Joshua was adamant his swollen eyes were not going to be a problem ahead of his heavyweight title defense against Andy Ruiz Jr in New York later today. The IBF, WBA and WBO champion is making his debut in the US but appeared to have a swollen right eyelid, a cut to his nose and swelling under his left eye. However, Joshua brushed off the damage as simply part of his preparations for the fight. ‘What happened right, I was sparring a lion, because I really want to take this camp seriously,’ Joshua told Sky Sports. ‘It’s just been tough, difficult training. I’m a fighter so the scars and stuff – look at my hands and stuff. That’s just another added war wound to my list of scars so that’s all it is.’ But the unbeaten 29-year-old dismissed the significance of his facial injuries, joking about how he sustained them during a sparring session. Trainer Rob McCracken insisted he was pleased with Joshua’s preparations, despite Ruiz Jr being introduced as a replacement after Jarrell Miller failed a drug test. “It’s been a good camp. He’s in good shape,” McCracken told Sky Sports. “The Miller change was difficult, but Ruiz is a better fighter I think. “A similar style comes forward, puts pressure on, but AJ adjusted. He’s worked hard. Good sparring and good sparring partners as well. He’s focused on the fight.
