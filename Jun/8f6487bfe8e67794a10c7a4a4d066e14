GOVERNMENT has been tasked to bear the cost of managing chronic diseases through a robust health insurance policy. Speaking at the World Scleroderma Day organised by Me and Sclero Foundation in collaboration with the Rheumatology Unit, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), which was held yesterday at LASUTH, a consultant rheumatologist, LASUTH, Professor Femi Adelowo, pointed out that government needs to bear the cost of managing diseases such as Scleroderma just as it is applicable in developed countries through robust health insurance policy. Speaking about management of Scleroderma, another consultant rheumatologist, LASUTH, Dr. Babtunde Olaosebikan, pointed out that Scleroderma is not curable just as other chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, asthma, but can be managed and treated if patients present it early. Olaosebikan also urged patients to present themselves early to their rheumatologist as well as belong to patient support groups available in their state or country. “They must also comply with medications and regular follow up visits,” he warned. On her part, the convener of the programme and Executive Director, Me and Sclero Foundation, Sarah Jato, narrated how she was diagnosed of the disease in 2006 and how she has been managing it ever since.”Planning a day was nonexistent.
