Anthony Joshua has conceded that he lost to a better fighter after he was stunned early Sunday morning by Andy Ruiz Jr in the seventh round, in an all-time great upset at the Madison Square Garden in New York and in the process losing his WBO, WBA, IBF and IBO world heavyweight belts. But Joshua has vowed to come back stronger after losing his first professional fight on his US debut. “Congratulations to the first Mexican heavyweight champion. We bounce back. “I’m a fighter by heart, boxer by trade, it has got people talking and there’s more life in the heavyweight division. “This is the risk we take, every fighter deserves respect so congratulations to him. I respect every fighter, this is all part of the legacy, it’s how strong I came back. He’s a champion for now, I shall return.” Joshua was the favourite against late replacement Ruiz who defied the odds to do the impossible.. “Boxing is a tough sport, but I train hard and I got beaten by a good fighter, it will be interesting to see how far he goes, but this is all part of the journey,” Joshua added. Joshua was knocked down twice in the third round before kissing the canvas in the seventh round and he revealed how his knockdown was different to the time he was caught by Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley. He explained: “When your legs are all over your gaff, you are trying to stabilise. “This is the first fight like that. Against Klitschko, I was just tired.” Joshua is expected to activate his rematch clause with Ruiz with promoter Eddie Hearn hinting the fight may take place in November or December this year.
