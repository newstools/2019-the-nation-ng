A civil society group, Climate and Sustainable Development Network (CSDevNet), has called for a remediation programme to combat desertification and drought. Its Board of Trustees Chairman, Dr Ibrahim Choji, made the call during a briefing as part of activities to commemorate the World Combat Desertification and Drought Day. The event, which had as theme ‘Let’s grow the future together’ focuses on three key issues: drought, human security and climate. Choji said: “Land in Nigeria has long been a silent casualty of war and armed conflicts. From the contamination of land and the destruction of forests to the plunder of natural resources and the collapse of management systems, the environmental consequences of militancy in the Niger Delta, terrorism in the North and herdsmen-farmers’ crises across Nigeria are often widespread and devastating. A small proportion of Nigerians in conflict-prone areas have the luxury of mobility which is not applicable to the land.” According to him, land is static; never mobile hence it is subject to varying degrees of exploitation and despoliation and because  land is fixed in quantity. There is ever-increasing competition to control land resources and capitalise on the flows of goods and services from the land. This, he said, had the potential to cause social and political instability, fuelling poverty, conflict and migration.
