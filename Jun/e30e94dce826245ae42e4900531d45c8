Sanity will be restored on Apapa Ports road this week,  the Presidential Task Force on the road said on Monday. The task force Chairman, Kayode Opeifa, told The Nation that they were working round the clock to ease the pains of motorists and other users of the road. With ‘’appreciable success’’ recorded at the Western Avenue, Iponri, Ijora, and Ajegunle axis, Opeifa said attention has shifted to Apapa-Oshodi to ensure sanity on the road. President Muhammadu Buhari, two weeks ago, ordered trucks and trailers off Apapa port and all access road within 72 hours. The task force was raised to ensure compliance with the order within two weeks. The task force moved to Apapa on  May 23,  met with  stakeholders and leadership of all road transport unions  till May 24, and started enforcing the order on May 25. Opeifa told reporters on Sunday that attention would be around Coconut to Tin Can, which he described as ‘’a thorny spot’’ because of the collapsed road between Mile 2 and Tin Can. He said he was heading to Coconut with  policemen to clear the area, adding that the team will work  throughout the Eid-el-Fitri holidays to sanitise the area.
