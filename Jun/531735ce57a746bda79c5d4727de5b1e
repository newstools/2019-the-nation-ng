RESEARCHERS have formulated a new form of drug which is said    drastically improves survival rates of young women with the most common form of breast cancer. The results of an international clinical trial presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, yesterday showed that the addition of a drug known as a cyclin inhibitor increased survival rates to 70 percent. The mortality rate was 29 percent less than when patients were given a placebo. Lead author Sara Hurvitz said  the study focused on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, which accounts for two-thirds of all breast cancer cases among younger women and have in the past generally been treated by therapies that block estrogen production. “You actually can get synergy or a better response, better cancer kill, by adding one of these cell cycle inhibitors” on top of the hormone suppression, Hurvitz said. The treatment is less toxic than traditional chemotherapy because it more selectively targets cancerous cells, blocking their ability to multiply. The trial, which looked at more than 670 cases, included only women under the age of 59 who had advanced cancer — stage four — for which they had not received prior hormone-blocking therapy.
