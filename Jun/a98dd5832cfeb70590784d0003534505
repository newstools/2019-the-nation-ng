Federal College of Education (Technical), Omoku, Rivers State, has regained full accreditation status of its three degree programmes. They include:  Agricultural Education, Home Economics Education and Industrial Technical Education. The said programmes are run in affiliation with the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). The Provost of the college Dr Emmanuel Ikenyiri, broke the news while addressing the 31st NCE/ and eight Bs.C joint matriculation held at the institution’s premises. Ikenyiri recalled how the aforementioned programmes were denied accreditation by the National Universities Commission (NUC) since 2016, owing to dearth of electricity at the permanent site, otherwise called Campus II of the college which houses the three programmes. Ikenyiri who was presiding over his first matriculation since he became Provost, is nonetheless happy that electricity is now restored at the CAMPUS which has been in the dark since 2015, because of the damage of many of the campus facilities by vandals. He also said the internal roads in the two campuses which were once death traps have all been rehabilitated and new ones constructed courtesy of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). He said efforts are on to fence the entire permanent to avoid encroachment by land grabbers. Most importantly, Ikenyiri said the move is to forestall activities of herdsmen that have turned the campus into a grazing land by destroying the farmland therein. Come next academic session, Ikenyiri said more degree programmes would be introduced in order to boost enrolment in the degree programme. Ikenyiri who regretted that the institution held her last convocation 10 year ago, announced to the delight of the students that a convocation would hold this year for those that have graduated at the NCE and Degree levels from 2011 to 2019.
