Association of Food Vendors in Nigeria, Lagos State Zonal Headquarters, have congratulated Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on his successful election and inauguration The Southwest Coordinator, Dr Olakunle Akinkusote, said Sanwo-Olu’s victory attested to the belief of Lagosians in the governor to take the state to the next level. He noted that the mandate given to Sanwo-Olu is an opportunity for him to leave his footprints on the sands of time. According to him, Sanwo-Olu’s victory was no surprise as he instructed members to vote for the governor. Akinkusote advised Sanwo-Olu to support the association to get rid of food poisoning outbreaks linked to street food. According to him, a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organisation said 2.5 billion people globally eat street food every day. He said: “Today, local authorities, international organisations and consumer associations are increasingly aware of the socio-economic importance of street, food but also of their associated risks. The major concern is related to food safety.”
