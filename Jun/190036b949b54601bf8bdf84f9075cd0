A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Razaq Bello-Osagie, has asked Governor Godwin Obaseki to shame those Edo politicians asking him for money by publishing their names. Bello-Osagie said it was worrisome that Governor Obaseki is constantly under pressure from a few greedy and disgruntled party leaders to distribute the resources of the state meant for development. Edo State Chairman of the APC, Anselm Ojezua, told newsmen after a meeting with Obaseki that it was the first time he was seeing Edo politicians openly complaining about money and reward for party supremacy. He said, “What you have are some of those who say share the money. That is not the essence of the APC. This is the first time I see people shamelessly talking about money. This is not the character of the APC.” The former lawmaker said it was good for Obaseki to shame the politicians particularly if their actions were distractive and they now want to reap where they did not sow in the election process. Bello-Osagie, however, said there was more wisdom for Obaseki to micro-manage the political class even under very difficult circumstances He said the political class is an integral part of the internal and external democratic processes. He said, “Leaders should be genuinely involved. We need statesmen especially those who are concerned about the party. “Obaseki must understand he cannot remove politicians. He should micro manage them because they were part of those that gave him mandate.”
