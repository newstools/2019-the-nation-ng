The Catholic Diocese of Nnewi, Anambra State, says it is targeting to produce no fewer than 500 new business owners and entrepreneurs through its foundation, Assumption Foundation for Diocesan Empowerment (AFDE). The foundation’s Chairman, the Reverend  Father. Daniel Ileka, said at the end of a three-day empowerment training for 350 persons at St. Cletus Catholic Church, Nnewi at the weekend that the organisation would provide funding for deserving people. Ileka said the training had equipped the participants with the requisite skills for modern business management, adding that the foundation would provide funding for the eligible ones. “We are thinking that by the end of the year, we must have raised at least 500 entrepreneurs who are going to be in charge of their business and these people are going to employ at least two persons,” he said. “Those who are trained are going home with great economic tips for their businesses, for management of their finances and knowledge for strategy building. “They have been taught documentation which is very difficult for most people, especially those who get daily revenues and need to become more systematic in their business approach,” he said. Ileka asked the people of the area to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the diocese and key into the empowerment training and benefit from the one digit interest rate loans for small businesses.
