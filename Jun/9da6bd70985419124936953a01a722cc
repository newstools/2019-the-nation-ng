THE Molomo family of Elewa Village in Abeokuta, Ogun State has petitioned the Ogun State Police Commissioner, Bashir Makama, to save their lives and properties from land grabbers. In the petition signed by the head of the family, Mr. Moses Olayemi, said: “Some people who claim to be members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), led by its Ita-Oshin Chairman, Alhaji Akeem Bodunrin (a.k.a Iyeru) have been illegally occupying and allocating our lands to individuals, families and corporate bodies.’’ The family said their efforts to stop  the illegality proved abortive. He added: “The parts of the land registered via our family surveyor, Alhaji Bashiru Durowoju via two registered survey plan: DAA/OG/96/131 and DAA/OG/98/128, with the remaining land un-surveyed till date due to financial constraints and challenges. He said in 2005, one, Alfa Kamoru (one of their son in-laws) took the registered survey plan of the land from  Mrs. Saratu Akanni, under the pretence of marketing. Since then, he claimed, Kamoru had been illegally selling the land, thereby denying families that have the legal right to the property. He further alleged that Kamoru and his group resorted to destruction of properties and extortion of  those that work on their land. The petitioner added: “We call on the government and other security agents to save us from these people as well as nullify the purported grabbing of our lands allocations which have all been done without due process. ‘’We also advise all those who allegedly acquired our family land through this illegality to vacate same as this land, being our sole property, will be fully protected within the ambits of the law.”
