The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has faulted the interception of containers on the highway by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON). A statement signed by the LCCI Director General, Muda Yusuf, on Monday  stated  if there are outstanding charges to be paid to SON, or where there are issues about SONCAP compliance, such matters should be dealt with before the container is allowed to leave the port. He said it is unprofessional for the operatives of SON to intercept containers on the highways on account of fees or charges that have not been settled by importers. Yusuf also expressed worry over the practice by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to instruct banks to place lien on the accounts of alleged tax defaulters. He stressed the need for FIRS to adhere strictly to due process in dealing with issues of alleged tax defaults. He said there should be  communication and engagement with taxpayers to properly ascertain a tax liability before placing lien on the accounts of companies. LCCI said the practice is very disruptive and has caused grave embarrassment to many corporate organisations.
