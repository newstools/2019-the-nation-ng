A CHINESE company and a subsidiary of Globelink China Investment Group, Hudson Mining Limited, is set to invest $30 million in solid mineral processing in Nigeria. The company decided to invest an initial $3 million and subsequently increase it to $30 million during the first phase of the project. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, Mr Solomon Cai, explained that the company intends to invest in tin and columbine in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Mr Cai said the company will buy the mineral products from local miners in the state and process them. The company chief spoke in Abuja, the nation’s capital, while meeting with workers of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC). He added that Hudson Mining Limited would also serve as a leasing company to local miners who do not have modern equipment to mine. Mr Cai said: “Hudson Mining is committed to serving Nigeria by a national strategy through developing mineral exploitation, processing, mining machinery and equipment manufacturing into Nigeria’s core economic pillar, relying on the advantages of its parent company, Globelink China Investment Group. Hudson Mining will bring into the Nigerian market technology, equipment and capital. It will gradually go into Nigeria’s mineral exploration, mining and refining areas. “To achieve these series of grand blueprints, Globelink China Investment Group has decided to invest an initial US$3 million in Hudson Mining Limited and subsequently increase it to US$30 million at the first phase of the project.” A representative the NIPC, Ahmad Gwandu, said the commission intended to work closely with the company. “Our own is to find a way to increase the activities at the local level, so that people will get something doing,” he said.
