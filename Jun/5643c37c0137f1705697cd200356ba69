THE Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has impounded various adulterated items, such as sugar, milk and fertiliser worth over N14 million in markets in the ancient city of Kano. Director General, SON, Mr Osita Anthony Aboloma, made this known yesterday at a general sensitisation of the agency market surveillance with business communities in the North-East and North-west zones. He said the seizure of the substandard products was carried out during a routine operation by a special surveillance squad. Abolomo, who expressed disgust over the prevalence of adulterated products in circulation, reminded that SON is currently prosecuting owners of the products and will not relent in ridding markets of fake products. Represented by the zonal head, northwest zonal office, Adamu Abba, Abolomo regretted that despite the agency’s close surveillance, local manufacturers and importers of fake products often bypass regulating agencies to perpetrate their nefarious acts. He explained that SON is banking on support of the business community and critical stakeholders across the country to check the influx of adulterated goods. According to him, market surveillance is one of the most important and strategic consumer protection strategies of SON, aimed at controlling the influx of fake and substandard products into Nigeria markets at the expense of ignorant consumers. He maintained that SON has developed some technical machinery and structures aimed at apprehending and intercepting substandard and fake products in the society. He said: “this sensitisation programme is another step forward to enhancing effective market surveillance through cooperation of all concerned.”
