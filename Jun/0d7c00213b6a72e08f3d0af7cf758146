THE national Union of Shop and Distributive Employees (NUSDE) has advised the Federal Government to provide the enabling environment for active public-private partnership (PPP) to bridge the huge infrastructure gap in the country. Its President, Comrade Innocent Jaja, said infrastructure problem in Nigeria persists due to lack of active PPP in the area. He said the government should allow the private sector to drive the construction sector for maximum provisions check infrastructural deficit. “All that government needed do is to provide the enabling environment that will aid the activities of the private operators. “There are millions of decayed infrastructures in major cities of Nigeria; they are not available for Nigerians to use because they were built by profit-making government official. “Government alone cannot provide the needed infrastructure such as roads, schools, houses, markets and others. There is need for full partnership between government and private sector, through a well-programmed PPP scheme. ‘‘This means leaving roads and housing infrastructure delivery in the hands of the private sector, while government provides the enabling environment.” Jaja expressed the hope that the active partnership of the private sector on roads infrastructure delivery would have great impact on the nation. He noted that for the PPP scheme to work effectively in addressing Nigeria’s infrastructure desire, government at all levels should go further and formulate acceptable policy frameworks. The labour leader added that government in this context should grant positive incentives to private sector developers, especially import duty waivers on construction materials, provision of infrastructure and credit facilities through effective mortgage system and tax relief, among others.
