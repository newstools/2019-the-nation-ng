Brazil’s Marta became the first player to score at five different FIFA World Cups on Thursday at the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. This was when she put her team 1-0 ahead in their Group C game against Australia in Montpellier. The 33-year-old netted a record-extending 16th FIFA World Cup goal from the penalty kick spot. She has already scored at the 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 tournaments. NAN
