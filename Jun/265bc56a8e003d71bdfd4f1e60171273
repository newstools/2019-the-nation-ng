One person has been confirmed dead as the traditional Durbar, Hawan Daushe conducted during the festive period of Eid-El Fitr and Eid-El- Kabir, turned bloody at Kano Emir’s palace on Wednesday. Two people were also reportedly injured and six arrested. The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II held the event without the presence of Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje who was at Bichi Emirate to witness the first Durbar in the newly created Emirate. In a letter, dated June 4 and signed by Ibrahim Hamza, the director of Special Duties, Office of the Secretary to the State Government, said the governor absence was due to some pressing engagements. “I am directed to inform you that His Excellency the Executive Governor of Kano State, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje OFR will not be able to attend this year’s Hawan Daushe due to some pressing official engagements that require his utmost attention. In the same vein, the usual Hawan Nassarawa to the Government house held on the third day of the Sallah has also been suspended by the state government. According to the letter, “While regretting any inconvenience this may have caused the Council, it is hoped that His Royal Highness the Emir will have a successful Sallah celebration.’’ The Nation reports that many were injured close to the end of the celebration when some suspected thugs attacked people and stabbing some of the spectators. Our reporter also reports of heavy gunshot that was not similar to the dane gun used for gun salute in honour of the Emir at the event. The Kano Police Spokesman (DSP), Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa confirmed to The Nation that six suspects have so far been arrested and the investigation continues. He said the corpse of the man killed at the occasion has been deposited at Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital while urging people to go and identify the victim.
