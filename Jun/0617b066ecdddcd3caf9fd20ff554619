Already, Lagos hosted the first audition at Stalad Gardens, Agege and Havana Hotels in Egbeda on Wednesday, while the selected talents slugged it out for a place in the quarter-final concert on Friday. Other auditions will hold in Ota and Abeokuta on June 19; in Ibadan and Akure on June 26; and in Oshogbo and Ilorin on July 3. Successful contestants from the regional auditions will proceed for mentorship at the Ariya Academy, where they will be under the tutelage of veterans in the Juju, Fuji, and Yoruba hip-hop scene. The competition will then continue on July 26 with the Quarterfinal in Akure, while the Semi-final and the grand finale will take place in Lagos and Ibadan on August 2 and August 9 respectively.
