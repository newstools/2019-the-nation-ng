The battle to be part of the Nigeria contingent to the 2019 All Africa Games enters final stage today as top table tennis players across the country compete for spots at the national trial holding at the National Stadium in Lagos.  Over 100 male and 50 female players are aiming for the top 10 spots available with the eventual qualifiers emerging at the two-day tournament.  According to the Secretary-General, Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF), James Eakyns, the turnout of players for the trial was impressive as some of the junior players also joined top players to battle for shirts.  “The trial is necessary as we have less than two months to the All Africa Games and we need to pick the best that will represent us for the games. We have decided to make it an open trial so that we can give everybody equal chance to make the team. We are indeed so excited with the huge turnout and we are hoping that we can use this to discover new talents that will rub shoulders with the top players during the final trial next month when the foreign-based players will be in camp for the final phase of camping before the team departs for Rabat, Morocco,” the scribe said.  Among the players aiming for places in the team are African junior champion, Azeez Solnake and Italy-based duo of Nurudeen Hassan and Jamiu Azeez. In the female category, national sports festival champion, Ajoke Ojomu will be hoping to continue her dominance against the likes of Tosin Oribamise, Bose Odusanya and Cecilia Otu-Akpan.  The 20 players made up of 10 male and 10 female will make the cu for the second phase of camping which will commence after the trial and they are expected to compete against their foreign counterparts at the final phase of trial next month.
