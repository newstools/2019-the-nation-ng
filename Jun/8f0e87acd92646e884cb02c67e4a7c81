Igbo group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has charged governors and politicians in Igboland to serve the people who elected them into the office or quit from politics. The spokesman of the group Chuks Ibegbu also warned the governors against looting public funds and asked Ndigbo to watch their elected officials and what they do with funds that accrue to the zone. In a similar development, the leadership of Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) has called on all the governors in the Southeast not to renege in fulfilling their campaign promises. COSEYL in a release issued to journalists on Saturday asked the Southeast governors to emulate the leadership qualities of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. Michael Okpara, Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu-Ojukwu and De Sam Mbakwe who they described as selfless leaders. The release signed by Chief Goodluck Egwu Ibem, President General of COSEYL charged the governors to ensure that they implement people-oriented programmes and policies to move the zone forward in their various states. According to COSEYL, any of the governors who knows that he’s not prepared and only cooked up his manifesto just to deceive electorates to come to power should quickly resign, stressing that the era of amassing wealth for their selfish use is over. “We advise all of them to go back to history and emulate legends like our founding fathers: Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. Michael Okpara, Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu-Ojukwu and De Sam Mbakwe in rendering selfless services to the did not end people.”
