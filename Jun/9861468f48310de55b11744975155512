The Simba Group, distributors of TVS motorcycles and keke – official sponsors of the Super Eagles – added great fanfare and celebratory spectacle to the departure of the team making its way to Egypt for the upcoming African Cup of Nations. The TVS King Keke and TVS HLX motorcycles, branded in the national team’s colours, led a motorcade style procession, surrounding the team bus as it made its way from the Golden Tulip Hotel camp in Asaba to the airport, on Sunday June 9. The procession, which attracted football fans on the streets and some residents of the Delta State capital, was a cynosure of all eyes and was described by onlookers who watched with admiration, as a befitting way of encouraging the Super Eagles as they commence their mission to capture a fourth AFCON title, when the Nations Cup kicks off on June 21. Mr Karthik Govindarajan of Simba Group, expressed confidence that the colourful send-forth ceremony, would go a long way to spur the Super Eagles to a superlative performance at the continental football fiesta. This colourful parade is our own special way of showing appreciation to the Super Eagles and furthering our association with football in Nigeria. We wish the Super Eagles all the best for the upcoming tournament and hope that they come back with the cup,” Govindarajan said. The TVS tricycle procession, marks the second time in two years that the Official Keke and Motorcycles of the Super Eagles, has staged such a remarkable event.
