Commercials, adverts have a way of walking into our lives leaving us with good memories that we cannot forget in a hurry. Just because it is #ThrowbackThursday, let us take a trip down the memory lane; Who remembers Papilo? “Papilo, one day, I know say u go help us proud”. This is an old Peak commercial which featured Kanu Nwankwo, a popular Nigerian Footballer. You would agree with me that this advert is ever green. Who remembers this advert of a young man eating noodle from a billboard?  “…and I was determined to nefa giv up” This advert was very popular because of this special line. I am sure it rings a bell. It is Kanu Nwankwo on this one again.  “Aswear, I no go do am again” This is a popular line of an old ‘Baba Blue’ television commercial. This advert was quite funny back in the days when N5 could still purchase two Baba Blue sweet. “Blue Band gives them the energy to grow” Even if you don’t remember any of the adverts above, you should remember the theme song.
