Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu has continued to solicit local and international support for the actualisation of the sovereign state of Biafra. The group’s Media and Publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, in a statement yesterday, said Kanu had been hosted in several states of America by members of the group in the country and diplomatic society. He said the leader was expected to move to Toronto, Canada, after the American tour. According to him, Kanu’s visit to America brought all Biafrans residing in the city and other parts of the world together to pursue a common cause under one dominant ideology. The statement reads: “The international move to gather Biafrans together for the total and final liberation of Biafran people from Nigeria by our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is gathering momentum across the whole world. Our people in America hosted Kanu, his wife Uchechi and his entourage at the Martin Luther Jnr Centre in Atlanta Georgia on May 30. “Many more Biafrans and Diaspora organisations are also preparing to host him in the various town hall meetings across the United States from Chicago to Houston, New York city, Maryland and Washington DC. He will also visit Toronto, Canada this weekend for an important meeting with IPOB family and Biafrans in Canada.”
