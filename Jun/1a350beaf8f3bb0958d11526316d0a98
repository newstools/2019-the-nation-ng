Villarreal forward Samuel Chukwueze revealed that he draws motivation from Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel and Ahmed Musa when they play for the country. Chukwueze earned his invitation to the national team for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations after producing a string of impressive performances in the Spanish top-flight during the 2018/2019 season. During his debut season in La Liga, the 20-year-old contributed five goals and two assists in 26 appearances for the Yellow Submarine. In March, Chukwueze made his international debut against Uganda in a friendly game and he is currently one of the youngests player in the Super Eagles’ camp in Asaba, alongside Sporting Charleroi’s Victor Osimhen and goalkeeper Francis Uzoho. After training with the whole team this week, he disclosed the influence Mikel and Musa have on his career. “When I was young, I used to watch Mikel Obi and Ahmed Musa; 2010 and 2014 World Cup. They always motivate me,” Chukwueze told the media. “Now it is a dream come true, they always motivate me to keep working hard so I can reach my potential.” As part of preparations for the Afcon, Nigeria are scheduled to play against Zimbabwe at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on Saturday. They will make their 18th AFCON appearance in Group B where they have been paired against Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi.
