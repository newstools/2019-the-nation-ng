Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Mr. Banji Alabi, said yesterday that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu will have the mandate of the people to serve the state for the mandatory eight years. Alabi, who is the Chairman, Governing Council of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic (RUGIPO) Owo, noted that Akeredolu came with twin promises of prompt payment of workers salary and infrastructural development, which, according to him, had been fulfilled. Speaking at the reunion of St Catherine Old Girls Association, Owo, Alabi decried the abject poverty being experienced  daily around African continent and particularly Nigeria. Besides, the APC stalwart urged the state Assembly to promulgate a law that will make kidnapping a capital offence to dislodge the perpetrators. He said Akeredolu’s administration had renovated over 500 schools, reducing the mortality rate of women at child birth as well as prevention and treatment of hypertension, diabetes measles and malaria and tuberculosis. Meanwhile, scores of Hausa community leaders from the three senatorial districts of the state yesterday converged on Akure, the state capital, to kick off the sensitisation exercise for Akeredolu’s second term. Numbering 500,the meeting was presided over by the Special Assistant(SA) to the Governor on Hausa/Fulani Matters, Bala Umaru. Bala said the sensitisation began in earnest as a sign of appreciation for what Akeredolu had achieved in the state for the people, particularly the Hausa tribe. According to him, the grand finale for the exercise is fixed for September, where five governors from the North would be in attendance. Besides, he said many National Assembly members would witness the occasion with three notable Emirs from their home base in the North.
