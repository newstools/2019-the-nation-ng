Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday warned the Christians pilgrims to Israel not to run away. He told them to be good ambassadors of the state. Sanwo-Olu told them to exhibit high standard and the sterling characters of good Christians, adding that no pilgrim should elope or do things that would “portray us in a bad light or bring us to disrepute.” He spoke at the Prayer Session and Seminar for the Easter Pilgrimage to Jerusalem at the Chapel of Christ the Light, Alausa, Ikeja. Represented by Ministry of Home Affairs Permanent Secretary Mrs. Adebunmi Elizabeth Adebukola, the governor urged the pilgrims who were about to be airlifted, to show humility, dignity, dedication and sincere spirituality during the pilgrimage rites and forever afterwards. He said “right here in Nigeria”, the pilgrims must more than before, begin to reflect on why they “are leaving families, friends, other loved ones, homes and work behind to make this important journey.” She said as the pilgrims would be “walking the path of Jesus,” their prayers and supplications would easily be answered. The governor appealed to them to pray for sustenance of peace and growth of Lagos and the nation. The officiating Minister, Rev. Olu Ayo Oladotun in his sermon, advised the intending pilgrims to separate themselves from habits and people that would diminish their spirituality. He said they must do away with drunkenness and anger so that they “can be able to assume the higher plane of spirituality which is the main purpose of their pilgrimage.”
