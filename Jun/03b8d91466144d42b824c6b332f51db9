A fake Medical Doctor identified as, Aliyu Ya’u has been arrested by the Kaduna State Command of the Nigeria Police for allegedly killing a patient. Ya’u who was paraded at the Command’s headquarters was said to have performed a medical surgery for hernia on a patient (name withheld) who eventually died. The Command PPRO, DSP Yakubu Sabo said, Ya’u, was arrested for culpable homicide and impersonation. According to him, “Ya’u is not a Medical Doctor, but he admits and carries out medical surgery on unsuspecting patients. He has confessed to carrying out hernia surgery on a patient who died in the process.” Meanwhile, Ya’u in an interview with newsmen boasted that, he had carried out countless and successful surgeries on patients. According to him, “I am not a fake Doctor. I studied at College of Health Technology, Pambegua, Lere Local Government area of Kaduna State. I operate a clinic in the village and I have carried out uncountable surgeries successfully. “All the patients I have operated in the past survived and nobody died. If anyone of them had died before, you would have heard. So, this one is just God’s wish. “The patient came to my clinic and I discovered that he was suffering from hernia. Then, I admitted him and performed the surgery, removed the hernia. Then, when I discovered he was not responding to treatment, I referred him to another hospital, where he later died. That is why I was arrested.” he said.
