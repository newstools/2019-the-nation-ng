WITH 75 stores expected to be opened in Nigeria within the next four years, the Executive Director/CEO, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC)  Olusegun Awolowo said the Council’s partnership with Africa’s retail giant, Shoprite will boost exports of Nigerian products in Africa and beyond. He spoke in Abuja during a courtesy call by Shoprite delegation, stating that he is optimistic that the NEPC working with local exporting companies would leverage Shoprite’s platform to increase the basket of exportable products from the country to African markets. He said the partnership will help meet the Council’s quest to bring Made-in-Nigeria products to over 15million Nigerians in Diaspora with a view to increasing the volume and value of the country’s non-oil exports. Awolowo said: “This development is commendable and would help our exporting companies improve the quality of their products as well as build strong brands for Nigerian goods in the international market. The memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed soon will be considered to actualise the objectives of the trade partnership.” Speaking on distribution of local goods in the international market, the General Manager of Shoprite Group, Nigeria, Mr. Carl Erickson, said the Group is looking to expand outside of the Africa, as part of strategic initiative to increase its operations and generally promote goods of African origin. He said with the partnership, local  products will be able to compete with other brands in the international market as Shoprite will provide a platform for promoting and marketing Made-in-Nigeria products beyond the shores of the country.
