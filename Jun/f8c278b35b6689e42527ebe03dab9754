HASSAN Alhameen, aka Harmeen, a 10-year-old rapper has said he is using his free time after school to compose music and keep away from negative peer influence. The JSS-1 student of Gold Field College, Ikotun, Lagos, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos recently. According to Harmeen, who is signed on by the Nigeria/UK record label, Efoski Entertainment, several children had become victims of negative influence because they did not channel their energies into positive things during their leisure time. Harmeen, who started rapping at age five, won the Murkreminisce Competition in 2018 and he received monetary reward for it from popular rapper “Reminisce”. He praised his parents for their support and guidance in nurturing his talents as well as ensuring that he remained focused in his education. “I attribute my success to my parents who have dedicated their time to building the needed character in me to excel both in my school and my music career,” he said. “It is the home training that has led me to where I am today. I just don’t want to be famous alone but to also be a good influence to my generation.” The young rapper said his role models in the industry had remained Reminisce, Olamide, Davido and many others. “My mum always tells me to do my best and my dad also encourages and supports me so that one day, I will eventually become a successful musician like my role models,” he said. Harmeen advised his colleagues to build a hobby that would keep them busy after school hours and prevent them from taking to vices. Harmeen has recorded four musical tracks and two videos and he was nominated as the next young rated budding artist by Wonder Kids Awards 2019.
