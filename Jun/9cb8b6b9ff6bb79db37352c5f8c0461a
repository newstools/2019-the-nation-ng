The Nigerian Army has commenced work on upgrading the army museum at the Mambilla Barracks to international standard. The army which took a cue from the Arlington National Cemetery Museum in fashioning the Nigerian army museum will also be upgrading the Buratai Museum in Borno State. For the upgrade to be a success, the army is collaborating with National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) to ensure that the vision of the Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant, General T.Y Buratai, which is to have a professional responsive Nigerian army in the discharge of its constitutional role is met. Chief of Army Standards and Evaluation, Nigerian Army headquarters, Maj. General Adekunle Shodunke, said that the museum when upgraded will remind Nigerians of the sacrifices made to keep the country united. Speaking in Abuja, at a meeting between the Army and NCMM, Shodunke added that the collaboration was made to inform the army of government’s policies on museums and monuments. His words: “The resource centre has the Nigerian Army Museum and the museum is being separated from the resource centre, as it is now we want to ensure that we bring the museum to international standards in line with the vision of the Chief of Army Staff which is to have a professional responsive Nigerian army in the discharge of its constitutional role.” Acting Director General NCMM, Abdulkerim Kadiri, said that the Nigerian Army’s approaching the commission for professional advice and guidance will not only be of benefit to the army but the Nigerian populace.
