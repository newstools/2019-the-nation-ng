THE Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC)  has given Meter Service Provider (MSP) Certification to CWG’s smart meters. The achievement of the feat came at a time the potential for scale-up in metering electricity consumers across the country opened. Before now, the operations of CWG Smart Utility Systems (SUS) had been restricted to servicing  clients within the real estate sector. Facilities management firms were the principal targets. However, with that model, there was virtually no opportunity to do business with the electricity distribution companies (DisCos). However, the conferment of the MSP certification has opened the CWG SUS product line to unlimited business opportunities. The firm will also be able engage with more DisCos, most especially now that NERC is insisting that Discos must provide meters  to customers to stop the exploitative practice of estimated billing. The rigorous certification process  lasted for over 10 months.
