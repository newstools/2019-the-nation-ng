You don’t need to resume to an office to make a living. There are websites you can explore opportunities beyond your geographical region and make money while working from home. You only need the following skills to register on the websites: •       Digital marketing skill •       Content marketing skill •       Social media managements/ engagements skill •       Graphic designer skill •       Writing skill •       Transcribing skill •       Virtual assistant /customer service agent skill These companies will credit your account immediately after completing certain tasks for them with your smart phones or personal computers. Your earning grows as you complete these tasks and could also be penalised if there is any form of irregularities committed with your account. Your earnings could be withdrawn through PayPal, bitcoins wallets (BlockChain, Coinbase) or through cheques. All these sites are quite legit and will pay when you reach the threshold. All you need to do is pick any of the under listed websites, read through their terms & conditions then register with the one that suites your taste. Many of the listed companies are remote jobs (jobs you can execute from home) and also the ones where you might be required to relocate (that is if you’re ready to take new opportunities). Note: This is suitable for sit- at- home moms, pregnant women, students, unemployed graduates and freelancers.

Checkup the below sites and register, be sure you are always available for service because a client could put up a complaint against you if you don’t deliver after the deadline and you could get blocked by the company. Also make sure you write up a very attractive gig or bio. 1. http://www.guru.com 2. http://Fiverr.com 3. http://UpWork.com) 4. http://jobscribe.com 5. http://linkedIn.com 6. http://transcribeme.com 7. http://gotranscript.com 8. http://amazonturk.com Goodluck
