The Southwest All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed delight over the election of Dr. Ahmed Lawan as Senate President of the Ninth Senate, urging him to promote cordial relations between the Executive and Legislature. The party also congratulated the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila,  and his deputy, Hon Wase, saying that Gbajabiamila presented a great hope for a leadership that will unleash his wealth of experience to build a responsible legislature. In a statement by the South West Zonal Publicity Secretary, Karounwi Oladapo, the party also congratulated the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege. It said the APC had found brilliant partners in Lawan and Omo-Agege  that share the progressive ideals of APC to move Nigeria forward, while Gbajabiamila’ s antecedents in the House of Representatives over the years raised a great hope for a new Nigeria that places emphasis on character and competence to lead a huge country like Nigeria with her complexities. Oladapo said: “It is on record that for the first time in the nation’s political history, Gbajabiamila started as a member of the House of Representatives and later was the Minority Leader before he was elected Majority Leader in the Eighth Assembly only to now top it with the Speakership of the House. “It is particularly noteworthy that throughout the electioneering for the exalted office, the refrain was Gbajabiamila’s competence, brilliance, leadership qualities and commitment to the vision and ideals capable of evolving development  programmes  to build a new nation. “We also want to praise  his colleagues across party lines who believed that his vision should be a collective vision to take Nigeria to the Next Level.” While also praising members of other political parties for lending support for Lawan and Gbajabiamila’s emergence as leaders in both chambers of the National Assembly, the party expected that as the National Assembly settles down to work, national spirit will guide members’ conduct to make a difference in Nigerians’ thirst for development.
