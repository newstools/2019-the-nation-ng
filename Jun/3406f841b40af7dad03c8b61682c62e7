After recently bagging ambassadorial deal with a Chinese tech company, Ja Solar Energy Equipment, singer, actress and entrepreneur, Chioma John, has added more feathers to her hat. The ‘Man No Be God’ crooner is set to launch her fashionable sunglasses, Cura, which got into Nigeria from China few days ago. Speaking on why she went into sunglasses business after she had established her hair, eyelashes and make-up brands, Annjay stated that her love for good look is inborn. “I went into beauty business because I like it since childhood,” she said. “It’s also part of my profession as a singer and a model.  I love to see people look good. We also know that the level of sunshine in Nigeria is something to worry about. That was why I introduced the sunglasses brand.” The Ebonyi State born artiste also said that she is a lover of entrepreneurship. “I have been doing this business before I went into journalism but not as big as it is now. Annjay products are international now. We have our clients globally. Some USA,  U.K., SA, Ghana and many more. People order our  products from there and we ship to them.”
