Winners in the Tecno Spark light up your dream were part of the SM Jury business conference held at the Oriental Hotel in Victoria Island, Lagos. The programme is meant to inspire and educate budding, youthful Nigerian entrepreneurs on how to make the most of social media and 21st century business skills in growing their start-ups. The new millionaire entrepreneurs present include Bolatito and Jeremiah, past winners of the Tecno Spark Light up Your Dream Competition. They were on hand to take attendees on a journey of how their lives and businesses took a turn for the better after winning N1 million in the competition some years ago. Jeremiah told the guests how his ginger farming business badly needed funds, including how he was able to more than double the size of his farm and yield with the prize money. He praised the participants for attending the conference and urged them to take that bold step in starting and growing their businesses. Bolatito, who owns a booming fashion design business, tipped guests on overcoming certain challenges in business. She thanked the TECNO team for believing in her and granting her the opportunity to relocate to Lagos and expand her business by gifting her N1 million cash prize. Distinguished entrepreneurs with decades of business experience present at the event included Chief Executive Officer of The Source Computers Victor Onyejiuwa; Mrs. Funke Soyibo, CEO, HNK Interiors and others.
