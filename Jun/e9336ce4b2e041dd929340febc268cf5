U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated he may place new tariffs on French wine to help bolster the position of U.S. winemakers. “France charges us a lot for the wine. And yet we charge them very little,’’ Trump said on CNBC, in an interview that largely focused on tariffs. “It’s not fair. We’ll do something about it.’’ Trump alleged he was hearing complaints from U.S. wineries about their market access to France. Earlier, Trump met French President Emmanuel Macron for commemorations of the D-Day landings. This is not the first time Trump has lamented over tariffs on wine, already in 2018 he warned that the tariffs on the European side needed to change. (dpa/NAN)
