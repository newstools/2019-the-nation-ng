The Lagos State Government on Monday took over the prosecution of dismissed Inspector Olalekan Ogunyemi, who is accused of killing a football enthusiast, Mr Kolade Johnson on March 31. Ogunyemi will now be tried at the high court following the recommendation of Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP). He has been in prison since April 5 following his remand by an Ebute-Meta Magistrates’ Court pending the DPP’s advice. The remand order was obtained by the police. When the case was mentioned on Monday, Magistrate A.O. Salawu said the DPP advised that the case be transferred to the high court. The DPP, she added, advised that Ogunyemi should be prosecuted in accordance with Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. But the DPP absolved the second suspect, Godwin Oji, of complicity in the case and asked that he should be released. The magistrate adjourned till August 6 for the case to be filed at the high court. Ogunyemi, of No. 17, Alhaji Ede Street, Igando, was brought before the court on April 6, on a temporary one-count charge of murder. Prosecuting Inspector Kehinde Olatunde alleged that he committed the offence on March 31, at about 5:10pm , at Onipetesi Estate, Idi-Mangoro, Lagos. Olatunde alleged that Ogunyemi, who served in the Anti-Cultism Unit of the Lagos State Police Command, shot Johnson, a 36-year-old father of one, to death, with his AK47 rifle.
