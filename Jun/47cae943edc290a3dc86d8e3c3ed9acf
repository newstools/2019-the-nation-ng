The United States (US) has invested over $5 billion in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, it was learnt. The US has also the largest commitment globally in the fight against the scourge with $80 billion investment. The US Ambassador to Nigeria, W. Stuart Symington, disclosed this during an event organised by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – Nigeria-Programme, where 16 nominated individuals were honoured and given awards for their contributions to the control of HIV in Nigeria. “PEPFAR is the U.S. government’s response to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and represents the largest commitment in history, by any nation, to address a single disease,” Symington said. He stressed that, through the leadership and generosity of the American government and people, together with the work of many partners, PEPFAR has saved millions of lives, averted millions of infections, and changed the course of the AIDS epidemic. The envoy explained that the war against the disease cannot be fought by one institution or group of officials ‘tasked by the government,’ saying “people, not programmes solve problems and they only do it by working together.” He said the prevalence of the disease poses a big threat, urging the Nigerian government to ensure that its citizens know their status for effective treatment options.
