The Mountain Top Rehabilitation Centre (MTRC), a faith-based organisation, has stepped up awareness about the dangers of drug and substance abuse among Nigeria youths. This year’s ‘World Drugs Day,’ has the theme: “Health for justice, justice for health.” It aims to address drug problems and trigger effective responses to the world drug problem, which requires inclusive and accountable institutions of criminal justice, health and social services to work hand in hand to provide integrated solutions. In line with this, MTRC held its symposium tagged: “The Rage of Drug and Substance Abuse in Our Society: What Must We Do” to tackle the rate of drug abuse and addiction in the country. The event was well attended by students, parents and government parastatals. Assistant General Overseer, MFM Ministries Worldwide, Kehinde Adegbolahan, who represented the keynote speaker, Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya, said there is no doubt that “drug abuse is threatening the future of our youths and indeed our nation. “The rate of drug abuse in Nigeria is becoming alarming and has consequently contributed to the rate of criminal activities in the society. Many cases of drug abuses are more than just physical, but spiritual. By the time you start asking people on why they get involved with drugs in a way that has eventually destroyed their lives, they will not give you a reasonable answer. But when you look at it from spiritual perceptive, you will observe that people have been held in bondage,” Adegbolahan said. He, however, identified two major reasons people go into drug abuse bondage, saying “there is vacuum in the heart of every human being and people try to fill it with all kind of things, including sex or drug addiction and other form of things.” The second, he said, is an angry spirit.
