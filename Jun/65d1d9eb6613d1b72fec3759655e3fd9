The wife of the Niger State Governor, Dr. Amina Abubakar Bello, has been confirmed as the chairperson of the Northern Governor Wives Forum. Her emergence as the chairperson came after the former chairperson, Bauchi State governor’s wife, Hajiya Hadiza Abubakar, had to leave the forum as a result of her husband’s inability to secure a second term. Bello was unanimously confirmed as the chairperson after a meeting of northern governor wives at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. She urged government at all levels to introduce skill acquisition programmes in order to create jobs that will stem rampant unemployment and breed a new generation of entrepreneurs who will transform the economic landscape of the country.
