Emmanuel Jime and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Governor Samuel Ortom. Emmanuel Jime is challenging the return of Governor Samuel Ortom of Peoples Democratic Party ( PFP) as Governor of Benue State at the tribunal. Justice Adebola Olusiyi, chairman of the panel who issued the order at the end of prehearing said the “course is now clear and the stage is set for full trial.” According to Justice Olusiyi, there shall be strict compliance with the number of days parties are entitled to.” He noted that there is only one pending Motion on Notice which will be taken outside prehearing. Ortom’s lead counsel Sabastian Hon SAN, who responded on behalf of the Bar assured the panel of their cooperation towards ensuring that trial is conducted in line with the law. He thanked their Lordships for the conduct of proceedings thus far. Earlier, while ruling on application by INEC for an order striking out certain paragraphs of Jime’s reply, Justice Olusiyi held that the panel cannot depart from its earlier position, to defer ruling until the substantive petition is heard. The chairman further held that there is no compulsion on the Tribunal to deliver ruling on applications before hearing the substantive petition. He accordingly differs ruling on the application pending hearing of the substantive petition. Similarly, Ortom’s application which was struck out last week and refiled was argued and deferred for ruling at the conclusion of hearing.
