Kano State Police Command on Friday paraded over 100 suspects involved in various criminal activities ranging from kidnapping, murder, armed robbery, possession of hard drugs and manufacturing of local weapons. Briefing reporters at the Bompai police headquarters, Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ahmed Illyasu, said a syndicate of kidnappers was busted, which led to the arrest of three suspected kidnappers such as Abdullahi Ali, Sani Rabe and Shuaibu Idi, who have been operating in Katsina, Zamfara, and Kano states. According to him: “In Kano, they do operate in Gwarzo, Kiru, Bebeji, Shanono, Rogo, Karaye, and Madobi Local Government Areas in Kano state.” He further stated the suspected kidnappers confessed to have five AK47 rifles in possession of their gang leader, who is popularly known as Gemu. The leader, he said, is believed to be hiding in Zamfara forest “but police has mounted man-hunt to track him down.” Illyasu said exhibits recovered from the suspects include 14 bags of Indian Hemp, 64 knives, scissors, axe, cutter, charms and hard drugs, adding that the suspects have been charged to court for prosecution. According to him: “On the June 2, 2019, a team of policemen, while on patrol along Independent Road, Dakata, Kano, one Abba Abubakar of Borno state and Sumaila Hassan of Dakata Quarters were arrested, and were found with locally-made pump action riffle.
