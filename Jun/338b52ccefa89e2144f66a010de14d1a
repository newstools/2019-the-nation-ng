As part of measures to halt the occurrence of some pilgrims over-staying their visa permit while on Hajj, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria-NAHCON, established a formidable Task Force with the directive of being pre-emptive of culprits. Membership was drawn from various security agencies and NAHCON staff. Similarly, the Commission has also concluded a three-day induction training and inauguration of staff committees charged with the responsibility of monitoring service providers of Nigerian pilgrims in both Makkah and Madinah. While inaugurating the committees in Abuja, NAHCON Chairman, Barrister Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad admonished members on some issues necessary for the comfort of pilgrims. These includes allocating rooms and getting them ready before arrival of pilgrims, that they must not be allowed to stay for long in hotel reception upon arrival. Similarly, there must not be overcrowding in rooms, pilgrims must not be served cold or unwholesome meals or unwholesome or fruits. He also enjoined the committees to ensure that there was no breach of contract on the part of any service provider, and where such occurs, the providers must be sanctioned appropriately. He drew their attention to the matters of accommodation security, sanitation, provision of toiletries and constant changing of beddings. The Chairman urged members of the respective committees to always discharge their duties diligently and not to compromise the pilgrims’ wellbeing but resist temptation and bad temperament, bearing in mind that there will be accountability before the Almighty. Committees inaugurated include feeding and accommodation in Makka and Madinah, hand luggage monitoring, tents and Masha’er, Turadudiyya (Transportation) among others. Heads of the various committees made presentations to provide more insight on expectations and realities on ground.
