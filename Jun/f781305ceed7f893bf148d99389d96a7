The scene of the exploded pipeline of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at Kom-Kom in Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State has been cordoned off by security agencies. Investigation into the immediate and remote causes of Saturday’s explosion by the security personnel and officials of PPMC/NNPC was ongoing as at press time on Sunday. Soldiers from 6 Division, Nigerian Army; policemen; operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and personnel of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were mobilised to the scene to ensure thorough investigation and to prevent the survived vandals from returning to the area. NSCDC’s spokesman in Rivers state, Mr. Akin Oguntuase, on Sunday evening confirmed more personnel of the security agency were deployed in the scene and adjoining area. He assured the fleeing criminals would be apprehended and prosecuted to serve as deterrence to others. The exploded pipeline led to the death of ten persons from the vandalised pipeline that conveys fuel from Port Harcourt refinery to the PPMC’s depot at Aba in neighbouring Abia State.
