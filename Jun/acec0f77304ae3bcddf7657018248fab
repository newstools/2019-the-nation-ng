Bayelsa State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant, Dr. Franklin Osaisai, has promised to build on the achievement of Governor Seraike Dickson when elected in November. Osaisai, a nuclear scientist, who declared his ambition to govern at the state capital, Yenagoa, said the people need a visionary leader to succeed Dickson. The former Director-General, Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission explained that he resolved to serve the people by making his declaration known to the people at the grassroots and Christendom. He said it was the grace of God that took him from a Chorister at the St John’s Anglican Church to the pinnacle of his career and becoming a pioneer chief executive of the Atomic Energy Commission. Osaisai added that his aspiration was borne out of compassion for service to the people of Bayelse, following the winding down of the Dickson administration on Feb 14, 2010. “I aspire to lead the people of Bayelsa to consolidate the achievements of Gov. Seriake Dickson and it is in realisation of the fact that leadership comes from God that I chose to declare my intention from where I had my humble beginning. Speaking at the occasion, Bishop of Niger Delta West Diocese, Dr. Emmanuel Oko-Jajan, said God instituted government and ordains leaders, adding that those who want to lead must have the right motives. He said that it was instructive that Osaisai did not forget his humble beginnings, noting that such a trait was rare amongst the elite.
