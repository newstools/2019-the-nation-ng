The dramatic 2018/2019 UEFA Champions League trophy will be heading to England, with Tottenham Hotspurs and Liverpool fighting to be king of Europe club football. The battle takes place this night at the Estadio Metropolitano, which is the home ground of Atlético Madrid Liverpool will be aiming to win their sixth UCL title. The last they won was on that memorable night in 2005, when they came back from 3-0 down to beat AC Milan on penalties. They have since appeared in two UCL finals but lost in 2007 to AC Milan, and in 2018 to Real Madrid. Tottenham Hotspurs on their part partake in the last fight for Europe’s club glory for the first time ever. Both teams got to the final after miraculous semi-final comebacks: Liverpool overturning a 3-0 first leg loss against FC Barcelona to win 4-0 in the second leg, and Tottenham Hotspurs also recording a comeback, which included a last minute goal, to defeat Ajax Amsterdam. They had lost the first leg 1-0, and were 2-0 down in the first half of the second leg, but Lucas Moura needed the second forty-five minutes to turn the table around, scoring a hat-trick to seal a place in Madrid, setting up the second all-English final in the Champions League history There are however some memorable facts to record about the UEFA Champions League final 1.
