Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has said that his yet-to-be-constituted exco will be made up of round pegs in round holes. AbdulRazaq added that his over three-month-old administration, unlike in the past, has been accused of not spreading political patronages. The governor spoke on Tuesday in Ilorin, the state capital, at a dinner/investiture night of the Ilorin District of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN). The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Kayode Alabi, said: “I assure you that professionals would be well-represented in our cabinet. We will ensure we put round pegs in round holes, even as we operate an open-door policy that welcomes quality suggestions from reputable professional bodies like the ICAN. “The last three months have been very interesting for us as an administration. Many of you must have heard whispers of my administration being very frugal with public resources. We have been accused of not spreading patronages like in the past. I can tell you that those whispers were very true. “We promised so much. We inherited nearly a red account and a debt profile not commensurate with the infrastructure on the ground. But that is now in the past. What that means is that we need a great measure of financial prudence and discipline to pull through. “We are therefore faced with the option of using the little resources to serve the overwhelming majority of our people or dole out patronages to the privileged minority. We chose the former and that explains the pace with which we are stabilising things in the areas of provision of water, healthcare, road rehabilitation, pensions and gratuities, education and basic facilities.”
