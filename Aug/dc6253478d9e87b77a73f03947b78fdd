The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC), on Wednesday announced two weeks extension of deadline for political parties to conclude primaries for candidates participating in the November council polls in the state. Alhaji Isa Shettima, the Executive Chairman of the commission, made the announcement in a statement issued in Yola. Shettima said that the deadline had now been shifted to Sept. 21, as against the initial Aug. 31. He explained that the change was as a result of the Eid el-Kabir festivity. The chairman said that all dates scheduled for other activities as contained in the election timetable earlier issued, remained unchanged. African Democratic Congress (ADC), All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP) have indicated interest to participate in the election and had since commenced the sales of forms to candidates.
