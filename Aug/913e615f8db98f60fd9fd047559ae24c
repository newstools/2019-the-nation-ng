Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha has advised his predecessor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha,  not to see the Judicial Panel of Inquiry to probe land transactions in the state as an attempt to witch hunt him. He said the former governor was making petty allegations. The governor said he has deliberately avoided the ploy of the former governor to drag his administration into controversy. Ihedioha reminded his predecessor that the people had already evaluated his performance, adding that he has a case to answer. However, he maintained that he has no intention to witch hunt the former governor. Ihedioha explained that the probe was setup, following complaints, petitions and lamentations by indigenes of the state. The governor wondered why Okorocha arrived at the unfounded allegations that the panel was set-up to witch hunt. He said he could not understand why there was panic in the camp of the former governor when the panel was yet to be inaugurated. Ihedioha said Okorocha regresed into the media war to distract his administration and derail his programmes. The governor maintain that he was not on a vendetta mission against his predecessor. Ihedioha said Okorocah was out of tune with reality, urging him to reflect on his past mistakes. The governor  said investors and donor agencies are not looking at the direction of Imo State, following the change of guard. He promised to fulfil his campaign promises and ensure that the mistakes committed by his predecessor are not repeated. Ihedioha urged the people to support his administration in its bid to develop the state. He said: “My administration is on course and cannot be distracted or derailed by mindless and unfounded allegations, which of course, are poorly rehearsed and diversionary stunts intended to pull wool over the eyes of Imo people and Nigerians. “I will subject to judicious scrutiny every action that violated the people and the extant laws of the land. But, the innocent has nothing to fear.
