The  Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council on Friday deplored the order by Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State that the people of the state should arrest his predecessor, Senator Rochas Okorocha and warned that the statement was capable of sparking anarchy. Okorocha himself called the governor a tyrant for ordering his arrest.. Ihedioha issued the order on Thursday after some youths believed to be  sympathetic to Okorocha allegedly  assaulted  the Chairman of the Recovery of Government Properties, Mr. Jasper Ndubuaku, while trying to invade a property of the former governor. Responding to the governor’s statement, the President General of the Ohanaeze Youths,  Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said it was a threat to democracy  and should be reversed immediately. He asked for the intervention of the South East Governors and other Igbo leaders in the current face-off between the Imo governor and his predecessor. His words: “We call for the immediate intervention of the South East Governors and Igbo leaders as we ask Imo State religious leaders, traditional rulers, State House of Assembly to join Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide to intervene.” Besides, he asked the people of the state especially the youths to  “suspend any action pending the outcome of the peace parley with the duo,” while urging Okorocha to “stay away from the state at the moment until the dust settles down.” He added: “We believe that Governor Ihedioha will see the wisdom and rescind the decision to arrest Okorocha. “We urge him to suspend the activities of Jasper Ndubuka committee on the Recovery  of Government  Assets until the situation is under control. “We will not allow any South East State to be under the control of a sole administrator under State of Emergency.”
