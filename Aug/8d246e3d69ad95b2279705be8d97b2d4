United Africa Company of Nigeria (UACN) has honoured its immediate past Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Mrs. Muhibat Abbas. At the event, which held in Lagos,  members of the company’s management, family members, friends and well-wishers poured encomiums on Abbas for her unrivalled service to the company and humanity. Abbas, who joined the firm in 1984 as a management trainee, worked across different units of the company, amassing wealth of experience as she held strategic positions to her credit. She served as Company Secretary, Group Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, the last position she occupied before her retirement last April 30. Chairman of UACN Group, Mr. Dan Agbor, praised the virtues of Abbas. According to him, apart from the fact that she worked only in UAC for 35 years, she, however, stood tall among others in the company with her exceptional qualities. “Muhibat personifies integrity, hard work and humility,” Agbor said, as he wished her the best in her future endeavours. According to testimonies received across board, the retiree was an epitome of discipline, hard work, honesty, transparency and accountability, among other virtues. To many, she was a role model and a mentor, an unassuming fellow, humane, compassionate and caring to a fault. Abbas said: “I feel elated to leave with good health and wealth of experience. I have navigated across different positions in UAC including its Pension Fund for 12 years and they are happy with my performance. “What you see today is a reward of jobs well done. I remember being posted to some delicate areas because UAC needed someone who is not economical with the truth. I had no godfather when I joined UAC till date. It’s all about upholding your virtues,” she said.
