Paulo Dybala must inform Juventus that he wants to move to Manchester United by Monday if the transfer is to go ahead, according to reports in Italy. The Argentine has been a target for the Red Devils for most of the summer but with Thursday’s deadline for the Premier League transfer window looming, time is running out to get a deal done. Italian daily newspaper Corriere dello Sport claims the Argentine must decide by Monday where his future lies, with a potential switch to Old Trafford one that involves Romelu Lukaku heading in the opposite direction. It follows a week where Dybala met up with boss Maurizio Sarri and other Juve chiefs for talks before he was ‘exiled from the first team and made to train alone’. Complications remain over such a deal, with the 25-year-old not against staying with the Bianconeri and having reservations of moving to United given their inability to offer Champions League football this season. In addition, United also have complications over the move as they have been left ‘disgusted’ by the request of Dybala’s agent Jorge Antun for a huge personal cut, in the region of £13.7m.
