Foreign shipping firms  in Nigeria topped the complaints chart by maritime stakeholders to the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) in the second half of last year. According to the log, from 150 complaints received within the period, 89 were about shipping companies. The complaints were on allegations, such as arbitrary charges,  and refusal to refund container deposits, among others. The figure was followed by 31 complaints against terminal operators, eight against freight forwarders, 12 against shippers and nine against foreign buyers. The statistics revealed that stakeholders complained most about arbitrary charges during the period captured in the review. The cases of arbitrary charges received by the Council from freight forwarders and importers within the period stood at 27. Other complaints include, refusal to refund container deposit, export/import fraud, short landing/loss and damage of cargo, storage charges, demurrage charges. Illegal use of licence, excess charges, cargo delay, abandonment of cargo, illegal charges, commercial dispute, inadequate holding bays, royalty charges. However, more than one quarter of the cases have been successfully resolved while others are still receiving attention. Maritime stakeholders had at different fora accused the Council of failing in its responsibility to intervene on behalf of shippers and their agents.
