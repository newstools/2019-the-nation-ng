Some residents of Gwoza and Bama in Borno State have expressed delight over peaceful Eid-el-Kabir celebrations for the first time in five years. Gwoza and Bama were among the communities displaced at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2014. Thousands of people from the communities, including the Emirs of Gwoza, Mohammed Shehu Timta and that of Bama, Umar Kyari El-Kanemi, fled their homes and took refuge in Maiduguri. Sequel to the peace restoration and resettlement programmes, Timta and Elkanemi returned to their domains in July, which avail them the opportunities to celebrate the season with their subjects. A cross-section of jubilant residents said they celebrated the festivities in a happy mood without fear of attacks by the insurgents. Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim, a resident of Gwoza, said he celebrated the Sallah with members of his family in a peaceful atmosphere. Ibrahim recounted that thousands of Muslim faithful attended the Eid prayer under the stewardship of the emir. Mrs. Fanta Mohammed, who celebrated the season in Bama, said she was elated over the peaceful conduct of the Sallah celebration.
