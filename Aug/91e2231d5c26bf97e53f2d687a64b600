A landlord’s son, Quadri Adebayo, on Tuesday appeared at a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly defrauding a shop seeker of N350,000. Adebayo, 26, is facing a charge of fraud to which he pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Ajaga Agboko told the court that the defendant committed the offence on July 16 at 11am at Harmony Estate, Langbasa, Ajah, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant collected the N350,000 from a shop seeker, Mr. Solomon Adelana, on the pretext that one of his father’s shops was available for rent. “He paid and took a carpenter to work in the shop, but when he later went back there, he discovered that the shop had been locked. “The defendant told him they had a family issue and promised it would be resolved so that the complainant could start his business. “Adebayo, who rented out the shop without his father’s consent, absconded with the money, but was later apprehended,” the prosecutor said. Agboko said the offence contravened Section 314 (1) (b) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate T. A. Anjorin-Ajose granted the defendant N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He adjourned the case till August 27.
