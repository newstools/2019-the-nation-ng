Red-hot Nigerian forward David Okereke has continued to receive praises from different quarters for his quality displays in the colours of the Belgian side, the latest of which is from the club’s head coach. Philippe Clement, Club Brugge manager, has poured encomium on the new acquisition from Italy after the Super Eagles’ hopeful netted another goal for the second consecutive game. David Okereke joined Club Brugge from Italian side Spezia only a few weeks ago and he grabbed a brace and an assist as the former league champions handed a 6-0 drubbing to Sint-Truiden in their first home clash of the new Belgian League season. The 21-year-old, who was also on target, on the opening day against Waasland-Beveren, has now been backed by Clement to have a successful time in the Belgian league. “The tension that some players had before the game was clearly not noticeable with David. It turns out that he is sliding away like that, “Clement told the club’s official website. “When he came in last month, it seems as if he has been here for years. He is very bold in the group and very inquisitive. We will enjoy him a lot.”
