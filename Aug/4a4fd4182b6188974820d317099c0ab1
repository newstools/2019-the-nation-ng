A non-governmental organisation, Human Development Initiatives (HDI) has announced an Education Trust Fund aimed at supporting the education of orphans, children of widows and children living with disabilities. It said the scheme was based out of the fact that the targeted groups are highly prone to dropping out of school because their parents and guardians hardly have enough to meet their educational needs. The Human Development Initiatives-Education Trust Fund, (HDI-ETF) supports government’s efforts in ensuring the education of selected beneficiaries from primary through university based on good behavior and consistent outstanding academic performance. A statement by Media Officer of HDI, Tosin Adesile, said the scheme provides beneficiaries with school uniforms, pairs of socks, ties, berets, school sandals, school bags, exercises books, mathematical sets and core subject text books not provided by the government while also paying all government approved associated costs or fees.
