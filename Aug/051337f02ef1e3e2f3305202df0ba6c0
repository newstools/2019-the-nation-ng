Policemen attached to the Presidential Taskforce on Apapa Traffic have arrested two suspected car hijackers at Mile Two, Lagos. It was gathered that the suspects were arrested on Tuesday morning while attempting to rob motorists in the rush-hour traffic. Their arrest came about a week after policemen attached to Satellite Division apprehended one Francis Abubakar, while his gang comprising three men were attacking motorists in an attempt to snatch vehicles at Mosalachi, Badagry Expressway. While the other members were said to have fled after policemen foiled their attempt to snatch an unregistered Peugeot 307 saloon car around 11pm. The robbers said to have shot sporadically, allegedly forced their victims to kneel before them by the road side. They however fled on their waiting motorcycles following gunshots released by the policemen into the air. Abubarkar was however, not lucky as the patrol team pursued and arrested him. It was gathered that the police recovered a short gun from him and the suspect wasÂ  transferred to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for investigation and prosecution. It was learnt that the two arrested yesterday might be those who fled last week. They were said to have been handed over to the Area E Command for investigation and prosecution since the Taskforce does not have such mandate.
