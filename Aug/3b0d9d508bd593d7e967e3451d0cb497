The Lagos State House of Assembly on Thursday commenced screening of the 25 nominees of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s for commissioners and special advisers. The screening is taking place at the Lateef Jakande Auditorium in the Assembly complex. The House had set up a committee at plenary on Monday chaired by the Chief Whip, Hon. Rotimi Abiru to screen the 25 nominees. And the 16-man committee is expected to report back to the House in one week, which means the screening of the nominees must be completed between today, Wednesday and Sunday. Prominent among the nominees is the immediate past secretary to the government of Lagos state, SSG, Mr. Tunji Bello and the editor of The Nation newspaper, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso. The nominees had earlier submitted 60 copies of their curriculum vitae, CV, to the office of the Clerk of the Assembly in reparation for the screening. The nominees will appear before the whole House for further screening and confirmation at the end of the committee’s screening.
