Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences Agency (Task Force) have begun a clampdown on illegal commercial motorcyclists plying restricted routes, including inner streets. Agency Chairman Mr. Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, said in a statement that the clampdown began yesterday, adding that 125 motorcycles had been impounded for flouting traffic regulations around Ejigbo and Cele bus stops. He said the agency embarked on the clampdown following complaints by the public about crimes being perpetrated by illegal commercial motorcyclists early in the morning and late at night. Egbeyemi said: “We will ensure compliance with the traffic regulations by commercial motorcyclists in our local governments and local council development areas. “In accordance with the traffic laws, every motorcyclist must wear crash helmet, be above 18 years, not ride on kerb/median/road-setbacks, avoid restricted routes, must not carry more than one passenger/expectant mother/adult with baby/child below 12 years, must not install any musical gadget, must wear an apron, must not operate beyond 10pm, must have a rider’s permit and have their motorcycle registered with the government.” He said investigation by the government showed that most illegal commercial motorcyclists are not from Nigeria, but from neighbouring countries, noting that some of them are involved in crimes. Egbeyemi warned okada riders to ensure that their motorcycles are registered with the government, “as anyone caught will be dealt with in accordance with the law.”
