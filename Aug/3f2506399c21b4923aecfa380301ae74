The Vice Chancellor, Delta State University (DELSU), Abraka, Prof Victor Peretomode, has been awarded the Thomas Sankara Agnize Award for Excellence by the Ambassadors of the Economic Community of West African States Youth Council (EYC), during its tour of West African countries. While presenting the award, spokesman of the group Ambassador Daniel Emeka Nwachukwu said the objective of the tour was to identify outstanding individuals who had distinguished themselves, particularly in human capital development, in order to recognise their input in achieving better lives for Africans. He praised Peretomode, particularly for infrastructure development, quick response to students’ challenges, among others. The EYC Vice-Commissioner of Engagement, Nochiso Toure, from Cote D’Voire (Ivory Coast), also said the VC demonstrated versatility on various issues bordering on Africa, especially relating to youths and nation-building. In his response, Peretomode said he welcomed the award because of the Council’s robust mission and vision that cuts across West Africa. Furthermore, he requested that Management would appreciate that the ECOWAS Youth Conference scheduled for September be hosted by DELSU, assuring them of free accommodation for all delegates as well as venues for the conference. The Vice-Chancellor acknowledged the role played by his management team, staff and students; and above all, God Almighty in his success.
