The lingering feud between Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi ll has taken another twist, as 11 district heads defied a directive by the governor to attend Hawan Daushe Durbar at their newly created emirates. Ganduje’s directive was issued in response to an earlier order by the emir inviting District Heads from all 44 local governments in Kano to attend the event in Kano city. A statement issued by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor Abba Anwar had instructed the district heads not to obey Emir Sanusi’s invitation. The statement directed that only district heads under the jurisdiction of the Kano Emirate should attend the Hawan Daushe in Kano. It added that district heads in the four new emirates created by the Ganduje administration should attend the durbar at their respective emirate capitals. But, 11 district heads, whose territories fall under the new emirates, participated in the Kano Hawan Daushe on Monday. These include Madakin Kano Yusuf Nabahani of Dawakin Tofa, Dan Amar Aliyu Harizimi Umar of Doguwa, Dokaji Muhammadu Aliyu of Garko, Makama Sarki Ibrahim of Wudil, Sarkin Fulanin Ja’idinawa Buhari Muhammad of Garun Malam and Barde Idris Bayero of Bichi. Others are Sarkin Bai Mukhtar Adnan of Danbatta, Yarima Lamido Abubakar of Takai, Dan Isa Kabiru Hashim of Warawa, Dan Madami Ibrahim Hamza Bayero of Kiru and Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta Bello Abubakar of Gabasawa. The district heads’ defiance is in continuation of the running battle between Ganduje and Emir Sanusi. The Ganduje administration is accusing the Emir of supporting its political opponents, an allegation he has always denied. The governor had attempted deposing the Emir, but some influential citizens had intervened and appealed to him to give up.
