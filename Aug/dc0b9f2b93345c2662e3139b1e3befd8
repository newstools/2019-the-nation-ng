Edo Director of Sports, Sunny Airende, on Friday in Asaba said that 22 out of its 93 players have been disqualified from the ongoing National Youth Games (NYG) Zonal Elimination. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the South-South Zonal elimination was in preparation for the 5th edition of the NYG, which would hold in Kwara State from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17. Airende said the players were disqualified as a result of over age, urging the rest of the players to remain focused with their training. “I want them to remain focused, not to be distracted in other for them to win medals for the state and zone. “They should train hard, put in their best as the state government has given them the necessary support for their preparation. “I am optimistic that when we get to the competition fully, we are going to do well and win medals for our great state,” he said. The director said that Edo came with seven registered sports; basketball, cricket, football, handball, hockey, rugby and volleyball. (NAN)
