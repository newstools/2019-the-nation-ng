The Senate has promised to work towards a speedy passage of the bill seeking amendments to the Surveyors Council of Nigeria Act No. S18 LFN 2004. President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan, disclosed this while playing host to a delegation from SURCON, led by its Chairman, Kasim Olufemi, alongside the Registrar, Kabir Mansur. Lawan was quoted in a statement from the council as saying: “We are going to ensure that we make the necessary efforts for the bill to see the light of day this time round. “You can be rest assured that you have the support of the Senate. I will personally push to see that it is signed. We will ensure that the bill gets a very expeditious consideration.” The SURCON chairman said they were at the Senate to reflect on their performances and explore new areas of collaboration with a view to fast-tracking Nigeria’s economic growth and national development. Olufemi urged the National Assembly to support increased budgetary allocation as a form of capital investment in survey and geo-infomatics. This, he said, would enable SURCON meet its mandate of surveying and mapping at full capacity so that Nigeria would attain enviable status in the sector like other countries. Olufemi lamented what he described as dismal number of surveyors in relation to the vast land Nigeria has. He stated that this was due to poor mapping and its attendant consequences of boundary disputes, insecurity, among others. The SURCON boss urged the Senate and other stakeholders to provide legislative framework that would facilitate an increase in the number of surveyors, their training and establishment of council offices in each state of the federation.
