With plenty of time and energy to burn during the long holidays, Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Dr Ganiyu Sopeyin, has advised parents to pay attention to their wards as the schools are not in session. While decrying the increasing trend of cultism and drug abuse among children during a TV show last weekend, Sopeyin, underscored the importance of parents monitoring their wards now that schools are not in session. Beyond checking their movements, she counseled parents to keep their  young ones productively engaged and encourage them to read as children are more vulnerable during the holidays. “The underlying fact here is that children generally are more vulnerable during the holidays hence, the need to pay adequate attention to all that they do during this period and if possible regulate their exposure to negative things on the social media,” he said. He said the task of fighting cultism and drug abuse must not be left to government alone, but be complemented by parents and non-governmental organisations. He said community leaders and other stakeholders must be concerned about stamping out vices, which are ways of exploiting children. Sopeyin assured parents and guardians that the government would not relent in protecting children from the menace of cultism and drug abuse. He also said the registration of children into Primary One classes of public primary schools was still ongoing, urging parents to take advantage of the extension, which runs through September to enrol their children. The SUBEB chairman also called on parents to take advantage of the recently launched free health mission tagged: “Healthy Bee Project”, by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to take their wards to the various centres for adequate medical attention so that the children would be healthier when schools resume for the next academic session.
