Delivering judgment, Justice Oluwatoyin Abodunde said Asateru, 53, stands guilty and is convicted to serve a prison term of five years, adding that the convict will pay N50, 000 fine as stipulated by the Child’s Rights Law 2005. Prosecuting counsel Ronke Odetola said the convict defiled a five-year-old girl on December 23, 2016 at Ifisin-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State.

Odetola tendered the doctor’s report and the defendant’s statement on oath to prosecute her case. She called three witnesses to testify against the priest.
