THE People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to rescind his directive to the CBN. Warning that the directive was capable of inflicting more damage on the polity, it described the directive as ill-timed and completely against the wellbeing of Nigerians. In a statement on Thursday,  PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the directive would worsen food scarcity, exacerbate the already harsh economic situation, general depression, frustration, resentment and despair in the country. He said: “It is indeed appalling that instead of bringing solutions to the depreciating living conditions in our nation, President Buhari is rather imposing more suffering by ordering the removal of subsidy on food even when it is manifestly clear that he had failed on all fronts to achieve any level of food security despite the huge resources available to his administration. “By this directive, the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have again demonstrated their insensitivity towards millions of Nigerians who are already suffering acute hunger and starvation due to severe food shortage and high prices brought by President Buhari’s misrule.” Stating that Nigerians do not in any way deserve such suffering being foisted on them by the directive, the said such situation will only breed further despondency among the citizenry.
