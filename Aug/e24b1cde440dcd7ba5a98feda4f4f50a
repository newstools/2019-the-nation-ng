In his swaggering white agbada and sometimes supernova smile, the BOS of Lagos set his cabinet in motion. Many had waited for that moment. In a solemn, sometimes vivacious air, the roll call of the commissioners and special advisers turned the morning ceremony into a foretaste of the years to come. The governor called his cabinet “unique in diversity.”  From the experience of Tunji Bello, to the youthful promise of Olatunbosun Alake to  the new voice of a Joe Igbokwe, and my colleague, Gbenga Omotoso, we anticipate a new edge. There are also the women. So, from east to west, the BOS of Lagos is now raring to go. He inspired the team, at once praising and challenging them. His speech-making is growing from its initial tentative pace to a relaxed, rhythmic control, his pauses holding that power to tease… For instance, when announcing the portfolios, he brought an air of playful mischief when he announced Bello’s portfolio. Knowing the audience expected Environment, he reversed it and said, “water resources,” and the audience resounded through the hall with “ha!!” He smiled and completed it by saying “and environment.” It is the quality of an orator’s stagecraft.  He has so far run his affairs with stately poise and dignity without airs. So, Lagos is unlike some other states in the rear. Governor Sanwo-Olu promises to be on a tear. So much to do, from traffic to environment to the expansion and restoration of infrastructure and education. He knows he cannot be in the rear, but rare. That is the goal he has set and that is the glare he will get.
