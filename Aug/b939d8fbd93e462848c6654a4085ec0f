The Nigerian Institute of Training and Development (NITAD) has canvassed the integration of technology in training professionals to enhance human capital development. Its Chairman, Annual Trainers’ Conference, Mr. Oluremi Ajalogun, who made the call at a briefing in Lagos, said the corporate world is going digital to promote effectiveness and efficiency. He said: “Digital transformation is the profound transformation of business and organisational activities, processes, competencies, and models, to leverage the changes and opportunities of a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact on learning and development in a strategic and prioritised way with the present and future.” Ajalogun said the society stands on the brink of a technological revolution that would fundamentally alter learning, relationship, and the workplace, noting that the response to this must be integrated and comprehensive, involving stakeholders. He said to enhance human capital development and boost performance in the workplace, NITAD will hold its 27th Annual Trainers’ Conference (ATC) in September at the Central Bank of Nigeria International Training Centre in Abuja. Ajalogun said the summit, themed: “Transforming learning and development in the digital era,” will serve as a forum for professionals and practitioners to brainstorm on strategies to compete more effectively in the digital world, delivering training means, strengthening core competencies and fostering new capabilities.
