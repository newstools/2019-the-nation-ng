Aritz Aduriz netted a sumptuous late strike, which helped Athletic Bilbao past reigning champions Barcelona in the opening match of La Liga on Friday night. Aduriz came off the bench to steal the show with a wonderful acrobatic effort from inside the penalty area which left Marc-Andre ter Stegen stranded. The buildup to the match was dominated by the news that Messi was unfit to play and the imminent loan move of Philippe Coutinho to Bayern Munich. The opening 30 minutes belonged to the hosts with Marc-Andre ter Stegen was called twice into action to keep out quality efforts by Inaki Williams before the quarter hour. Barca’s best first-half chance was gifted to them when Athletic’s Unai Lopez played a back pass right to the feet of Luis Suarez only for the Uruguayan to smash his shot off the post with only the keeper to beat. Suarez picked up a knock on the play and made way for Rafinha on 37 minutes and the Brazilian rattled the crossbar minutes later before the half time call. Despite dominating possession Ernesto Valverde’s side only managed one shot on goal in the entire match, Barca will hope that this loss would not affect their quest in defending their La Liga title. The result marks the first time Barcelona lost in an opening La Liga fixture since a 1-0 loss to Numancia in August 2008, ending a run of 10-straight wins on matchday one in the league. Next up for Barcelona is a home match against Real Betis, defending champions will hope Messi can return to action.
