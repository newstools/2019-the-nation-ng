A YET-to-be identified girl has been found dead in a hotel at Amukpe area of Sapele town, in Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State. The Nation gathered that the deceased had lodged in the hotel with a male partner, who was suspected to be her boyfriend. It was learnt that some of the hotel workers, however, suspected foul play when they saw the boyfriend trying to escape from the hotel. They reportedly stopped him and followed him to the room where he lodged with his lover, but found the girl dead. The workers were said to have raised the alarm, held the suspect and handed him over to the police. The Nation gathered that the girl entered the bar of the hotel with the young man; they both drank Campari before they retired to the room. The Delta State Police Command confirmed the death and arrest. Spokesman Adeyinka Adeleke said: “Yes it’s true. They told me about somebody who died in a hotel room. “Be careful about that story because we don’t know the reason or what might have killed her. But they said they are suspecting fumigation. Be careful about what you write about it. We are not really sure about it, but it’s true.”
