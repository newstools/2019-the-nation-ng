Popular social influencer, Fanu Omolade, popularly known as Witty Gem, has reacted to a viral video of OAP, Toke Makinwa where she (Makinwa) advised young ladies to frustrate their partners on their happiest days. Omolade said Toke who is a role model should always lay positive foundations for the next generation. “Toke Makinwa is a role model to many young girls out there, myself included. Hearing her use the excuse of being a “Scorpio” is ridiculous. Men do not appreciate such nonsense. Any lady that follows her advice is definitely a witch,” she said. She quoted Toke to have said, “A Scorpio chick is crazy, the kind of bitch that will piss her man off just because he is happy, why are you happy? She’ll just fuck up his day most especially on those days he can’t afford to be pissed off, maybe he has an important meeting or he is about to close up a deal.” Omolade expressed disappointment in Toke stating that her utterances shows how irresponsible she is and which might be the reason her marriage hit the rock in no time. “This is very irresponsible of someone to say, especially someone who is a mentor to many young girls out there, advising them to piss their man off just because they can is ridiculous and such shouldn’t be heard from a Woman as Toke Makinwa. “I’m highly disappointed in her but I hope she can change this narrative and apologize for her excesses, I still remain a fan, I love her style and she slays every goddamn thing, I just hope she realizes the statement she made was uncalled for and we deserve better”.
