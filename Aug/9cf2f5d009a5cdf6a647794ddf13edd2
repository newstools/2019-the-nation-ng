 After an impressive run at the Wimbledon, 15 year old American tennis player Gauff Coco is again tickling the fancy of many with her performance at the US Open. Handed a wild card entry, Coco has so far left no one in doubt that the wild card was not a waste as she hit the third round in style beating Timea Babos 6-2 4-6 6-4 to set up a clash on Saturday against World number one Naomi Osaka. She was dubbed giant killer when she overcame Serena Williams at the Wimbledon and Saturday’s clash is another huge hurdle for the ever determined teenager who has warmed her way into the hearts of many tennis fans. The Osaka/Coco clash is huge and will indeed be the focus especially billed for an arena with a capacity of 24,000 spectators, the Arthur Ashe arena. The odds one may say favours Osaka 21 who clinched last year’s US Open and this year’s Aussie Open but the pressure also will be on her facing this Coco character who appears to have adopted operation fight to the finish as a her motto. The fans have been giving Coco the much needed support and it will be fun to see how they will react when Coco versus Osaka takes the centre stage. While Coco’s two defeated opponents Anastasia Potapova and Babos are from Russia and Hungary respectively Osaka has always been based in South Florida and did consider representing USA at a point despite having a Haitian father and Japanese mother. Coco is considered the underdog but her fighting spirit does not indicate that she will be overwhelmed on Saturday an indication that fans are in for a good show that will leave them perhaps asking for more. Three major players will be on parade on Saturday, Naomi, Coco and the crowd!
