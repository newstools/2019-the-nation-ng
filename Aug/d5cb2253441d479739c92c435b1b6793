Gunmen suspected to be cultists have shot dead the leader of a vigilance group in Rivers State. The victim, identified as Emmanuel Ikechukwu, who was said to be the leader of Choba community security outfit in Obio/Akpor Local Government, was allegedly killed in his Rumuchuakara home town, about 10pm on Wednesday by the armed men. Besides the security leader, two other persons allegedly sustained gunshot injuries in the hands of the hoodlums. The incident, according to the community source, caused tension among residents of Rumuchuakara and their neighbouring community. The source, who claimed to be a member of the bereaved family, who preferred anonymity, told reporters in Port Harcourt on Thursday that the victim, who he referred to as his uncle, was killed by suspected cultists, who were in the community on a different mission. He said the victim, who was also the youth leader of the community, had confronted and interrogated his killers to disclose their identity and mission in the community, as he did not recognise them as residents of the community. The source suspected that his killers might have shot him in anger for trying to unveil their identity and mission in the area. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed the incident, but noted that the victims was killed by yet to be identified individuals. He said Police Commissioner Mustapha Dandaura had ordered investigation into the killing, adding that peace had been restored.
