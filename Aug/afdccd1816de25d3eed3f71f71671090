Life Lager, the beer brand renowned for inspiring progress and for celebrating the culture of the South East people has added another landmark achievement to its growing list of successful consumer engagements. The 2019 edition of Hi-Life Fest, which is proudly sponsored by Life Lager, came to a fitting conclusion recently. The competition, which is in its third year, has been a huge success with various regional knockouts across the south-eastern parts of the country. The search for the next Hi-Life king saw Life Lager head to cities such as Awka, Asaba, Onitsha, Enugu, and Port-Harcourt. After two months of exciting musical events across these cites, four finalists emerged as the cream of the crop and these four talented artistes took to stage in Onitsha, hoping to do enough to impress the judges on the night. The judges included actor/singer – David Jones David, renowned dance instructor – Dr. Jude Akaz, highlife legend – Bright Chimezie, and Nigerian music icon- Onyeka Onwenu. After a keenly contested showpiece, Chijioke Charles emerged as the winner of the singing category and Ofu Obi Dance Troupe won in the dance category. All winners on the night were clearly elated, particularly as they were handed their cheques.”
