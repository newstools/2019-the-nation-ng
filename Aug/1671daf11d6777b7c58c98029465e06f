THE President, Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) Chartered, Prof Olukunle Iyanda, has urged the Federal Government to tackle the insecurity and infrastructural deficit in the country. Speaking in Lagos with reporters, he said it was possible to lift people out of poverty, stressing the need to adopt the right policies, focus more on people than on politicians and be less partisan. He said: “If you want to lift people out of poverty, do not give them money, but empower them with jobs. The only way to create jobs is to be productive and you cannot be productive without electricity and good roads.” On food security, Iyanda wondered whether Nigerian would ever attain development, if she keeps importing food from other countries. “No grain of rice or tomatoes should be imported into Nigeria. We can produce rice, as well as tomatoes, and even export then to other countries. “We should encourage agriculture in Nigeria. If we do, we will not import from outside,” he said. Iyanda said the institute, as part of its contribution to nation building, would hold a national management conference with the theme: “Managing the challenges of democracy”. He said the conference,  scheduled to hold between September 15 and 17 in Abuja, hopes to proffer solutions to improving the myriad of challenges facing the country.
