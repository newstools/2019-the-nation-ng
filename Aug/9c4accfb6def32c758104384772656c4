TAYO: What are the modalities of payment for those who joined the civil service in 2003 going by the Pension Act? PENCOM: Any employee who is entitled to retirement benefits under any pension scheme existing before the 25th day of June, 2004, being the commencement of the Pension Reform Act, 2004 falls under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). You may liaise with your PFA who would advise you further in respect of modes of payment when you retire. ABDULSALAM: My name is Abdulsalam, a staff of Yaba LCDA. I have been with Stanbic IBTC Pension since its inception. But just this month, my pension fund was transferred to Leadway Pensure without my authorisation. Please what can I do because I want Stanbic as my pension manager. STANBIC IBTC PENSION: Please note that the policy of the National Pension Commission (PenCom) on multiple registrations is the ‘First PIN’ rule which recognises the first RSA PIN generated for a client as the valid one to be maintained. Based on this, Mr Abdulsalam’s first PIN as confirmed by PenCom is the PIN registered with Leadway Pensure. Therefore, his RSA PIN with us was invalidated and the funds transferred to his valid Pension Fund Administrator in January 2019. Kindly note that Mr Abdulsalam was informed of his valid RSA PIN with Leadway via a letter dated 10 October 2018.  We advise that he provides his Leadway PIN to his employer to ensure his RSA is credited timely. However, he can choose to transfer back to us once the transfer window is opened by PenCom. Do note that we also called him today to provide further clarification but our calls were unpicked. We would try again before  the close of business. SULEIMAN: I  retired on Level 14 Step 10 in June 1996 And Was Last Paid N59400 Monthly in March 2018.

I want to change my PFA because I am not satisfied with my current PFA. Is it possible for me to change and move my pension fund to another in my current situation? Thanks.
