The Ondo State All Progressives Congress (APC) has criticised the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for releasing imaginary allegations to distract the state government. The PDP was accused of a desperate attempt to smear the image of the ruling party. The opposition party recently accused the APC-led government of defrauding the state, impoverished traditional institutions and destroying the health sector, among others. A statement by its spokesman, Alex Kalejaiye, said: “APC is deeply astounded that a party that carried out a crude castration and strangulation of the state finances could issue such a statement in less than 30 months of its exit. “The party wishes to declare with all sense of modesty that the current administration has proved that it has come to serve the people; develop the land, and not to plunder the treasury. “The above assertion explains why the government never struggled to pay salaries as at when due. Pensions that the previous administration considered an aberration are also being paid. “It is incongruous to listen to a government that couldn’t pay salaries for several months, and left behind hundreds of billions of debts, accuse the APC government of defrauding the state, with all the celebrated infrastructures that are visible, to even the blind. “In the health sector, the APC government has so far employed about half a million health workers to ensure a healthier state.”
