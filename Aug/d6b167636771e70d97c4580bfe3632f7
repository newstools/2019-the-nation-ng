The Future Awards Africa has announced the call for nominations for this year’s edition scheduled to take place in November. The launch event which held at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, saw Amina Mohammed, the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations endorsing the prestigious awards which has been described as the “Nobel Prize for young Africans.” With the theme, ‘Nigeria’s New Tribe’, The Future Awards Africa rewards excellence and service amongst youth between the ages of 18 and 31. Speaking at the event, Ms. Mohammed said: “Even while we all acknowledge our socio-economic issues and challenges, our hope for the future is bound on the talent, creativity, and determination in every young Nigerian. They represent the much-needed agents of change – a new and perfect direction in giving back power to our youth – so joining the new tribe should be a movement every young person should aspire to be a part of.” The Chief Operation Officer, The Future Project, Bukonla Adebakin, said: “We are doubling down on the theme, ‘Nigeria’s New Tribe’ as there’s no better time to identify, acknowledge, and showcase a new set of bright, young Nigerians leading the charge to establish a positive, new narrative for the continent. We therefore urge everyone to nominate outstanding young people in different communities across the country so as to inspire many others who need models of hard work, creativity, impact, and integrity to emulate.” Persons eligible for nomination must have made considerable impact within Nigeria and/or globally within the last one year and must have easily accessible documentation of their achievements.
