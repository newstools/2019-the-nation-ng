Two women, Blessing Asugwa and Joy Ogbu, were on Wednesday brought before an Ebute-Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly defrauding a housewife of N21million. Asugwa, 23, and Ogbu, 24, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge of obtaining under false pretence, fraud and theft. Prosecuting Inspector Oladele Adebayo alleged that the defendants committed the offence between 2015 and 2017 at the Computer Village, Ikeja, Lagos. The court heard that the defendants collected the cash from the complainant, Mrs Amaka Joel, with a promise to help her invest in a business but failed to do so. They allegedly failed to return the money. Chief Magistrate O. O. Olatunji granted them N5 million bail with two sureties each in the like sum. The case continues on September 3.
