AN Ado-Ekiti High Court has sentenced two men, Adewa Sunday, 34, and Adedayo Amos, 33, to death by hanging for robbery and illegal possession of firearms. Delivering judgment, the Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, held that the prosecution had proved its case of robbery and illegal possession of firearms. He said the evidence tendered proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecuting counsel Gbemiga Adaramola said the convicts robbed Mrs. Abosede Oyeyemi Malomo at Ilogbo-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government on June 4, 2015. He said they attacked the victim with guns, cutlasses and other weapons, thereby injuring her. The victim was said to be reading at night when they broke into her apartment and robbery her at gunpoint. During the operation, one of the convicts was said to have mistakenly called the name of his colleague, which served as a lead for the police to carry out their investigations. Hearing began on March 27, 2017 and two count charges bordering on robbery and illegal possession of firearms were slammed on the convicts. During hearing, the prosecuting counsel called two witnesses and also tendered a cut to size pistol, iPad and the victim’s statement on oath as exhibits. Counsel to the defendants, Adeyinka Opaleke, didn’t call any witness.
