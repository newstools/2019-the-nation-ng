SmaRtphone giant, Tecno Mobile at the weekend in Lagos, bankrolled the BMW Autofest, which held in Victoria Island, Lagos. In a statement, the firm said lovers of BMW and luxury cars  were there to add colour to the occasion. The event showcased BMW super car and power bike models of various kinds. As usual, Africa’s most preferred smartphone brand, Tecno was on hand to capture the colourful event as a sponsor. “The fun Tecno mascot, Tboy and its stunning cheerleaders, were also on ground to give guests at the event a chance to experience a variety of smartphones from the brand. “We are delighted that there was visible excitement in the air as stunt men displayed their skills in a parade of classic and more recent BMW car and bike models,” the statement read. While some say it is the biggest Autofest in Africa, others say it is best. “Whatever you choose to call it, this year’s edition was very well-befitting of the class and sophistication that Tecno and BMW are known for. “Plus, there was a prize giveaway, which further spiced up the event, in which one pleasantly surprised young lady emerged winner. Clearly, the Tecno brand is not just about awesome smartphones but also about awesome experiences for its many fans,” the statement added.
