Minister of Interior, and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola has described his appointment as a call to greater service. He promised to use his exceptional skill for problem solving in his new position. The former governor acknowledged the great challenge to deliver, assuring that he will live to expectation. Aregbesola said it was heart-warming that President Muhammadu Buhari had captured the people’s expectations in his ‘Next Level Agenda’. He also said that, with the Next Level battle-cry, the president had already set agenda for the new ministers, adding that what is left is for them  to come up with achievable ideas and documents that are critical to its fulfilment. In his view, the widening gap between the poor and the rich, which has resulted in the falling living standard,  was due to inequitable distribution of  wealth. Aregbesola lamented that few corrupt people controlled over 90 percent of the wealth. He called for the redistribution of national wealth to reduce poverty. The minister urged Nigerians to embrace the culture of hardwork and diligence, adding that there is gain in dignity. Aregbesola urge Nigerians to cooperate with the Federal Government in its bid to give them a lease of life. He said: “Some of the economic hardship being experienced by some individuals were self-imposed due to ostentatious life-style that could not be sustained by their income. People should live within their income, instead of living a fake life-style. Self-discipline should be the watch word.” Aregbesola thanked the president for appointting him as a minister, assuring that he will live to expectation.
