WHILE on holiday last July, billionaire Femi Otedola and his  daughters stopped by in Italy for some Gelato, the video of which DJ Cuppy excitedly posted online and bang!, it went viral, spurning countless rehashes, memes and skits by established stars and social media influencers and users. Weeks later, DJ Cuppy, who is a Law graduate of Kings College, London, teamed up with rave-of-the-moment street hop star, Zlatan, of the Zanku fame, to collaborate on a new song fittingly titled ‘Gelato’. Since its release, Gelato has enjoyed streaming and downloads on music-streaming websites like Spotify, Tidal, Boomplay, Soundcloud and MTN Music among others. DJ Cuppy, whose real name is Florence started out as a deejay, a female in a male-dominated sector where talents abound and the competition is cutthroat. She has made many hits including, ‘Green Light’ featuring Tekno.
