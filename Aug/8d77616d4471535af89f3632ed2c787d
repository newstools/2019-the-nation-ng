The traditional ruler of Awka, Obi Gibson Nwosu, has appealed to the Vice Chancellor of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka (UNIZIK), Prof. Charles Esimone, to provide jobs and admissions in the institution to indigenes of the community. The monarch and his subjects reiterated that the community does not have two traditional rulers as being alleged in some quarters, saying anyone who parades as one should be treated as an impostor. They spoke yesterday when the Vice Chancellor and management of the institution visited the palace. Director of UNIZIK Business School and a cabinet chief in Awka Prof. Austin Nnonyelu said some people wanted to cause problems in the town by parading themselves as traditional rulers. He urged the visitors to disregard such people. According to him, the community had custom and traditions, and the people who picked Obi Nwosu as their monarch about 30 years ago did not make any mistake as the community has been peaceful since. President-General of the community Chief Tony Okechukwu, and other High Chiefs, corroborated Nnonyelu, while Obi Nwosu endorsed everything they said. They, however, said some of the challenges being faced in the community were unemployment, not enough admission slots for their children and insecurity. Prof. Esimone told the monarch that his mission was to take his blessings and to officially introduce himself as the VC.
