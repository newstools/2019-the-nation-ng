A murder suspect, Ibrahim Tafiyau has been arrested for murder by the Niger state Police Command nine months after he and his gang committed the murder. Ibrahim Tafiyau from Tutungo village of Paiko local government area of Niger state had conspired to kill one Abdullahi Mohammadu of Izom in Gurara Local Government of the state. It was learnt that on November 11, 2018 Ahmadu Abdullahi, had reported to the police that his son Abdullahi Mohammadu left home with a Bajaj motorcycle and was attacked by unknown armed men along Izom-Suleja road who also made away with the motorcycle. According to the bereaved father, the armed men inflicted injuries on his son who later died. It was also learnt that on December 5, 2018, one Babangida Shaibu was arrested in possession of the said motorcycle and was charged to court. Investigations had been on since then and the suspect, Ibrahim was trailed and apprehended by a team of policemen attached to Gawu-Babangida Division. Confessing to the crime, Ibrahim said he and two others who are still at large had killed the victim and made away with his motorcycle. Ibrahim told our Correspondent that he never knew that police will get at him, “I thought that the case is over. Frankly speaking, I thought that this matter has died down since 2018; I do not even know that Police is still dragging the matter. I never knew that police was trailing me until I was arrested. “Myself and my gang members actually killed the victim and dispossessed him of his motorcycle; we thought it was all over not knowing that the long arm of law will one day catch up with us one by one.” The Niger state Police Command Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar said the Police are still on the trail of others adding that they are not resting until they are all brought to book. He said that the matter has been charged to court.
