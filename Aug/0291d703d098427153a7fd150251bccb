Teachers under the aegis of College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) of the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, will resume their suspended strike today. The resolution followed the union’s Congress a fortnight ago where members resolved to resume indefinitrike should management refuse to heed the union’s demands withing a two week window. “In line with the resolution and directive of the congress of the union, it has become obvious that the college management and the Governing Council are not genuinely interested in proffering solutions to the demands of our union,” a statement signed by the union’s chairman and secretary comrades Ige Ajayi and Alaka Micheal, stated. The union is demanding among other things:  immediate commencement of payment of 53.37 per cent allowances and arrears; rescuciitation of Internally Generated Revenue program; payment of outstanding honoraria; and approval of promotion criteria for accademic staff. Others include:establishment of college/school based book shop; and release of 22.8m Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund); money to the deserving beneficiaries. The Senior Staff Union of Colleges of Education (SSUCOEN) of the institution similarly embarked on strike since Monday last week over what the union described as intimidation and victimisation of the members.
