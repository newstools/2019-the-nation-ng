Participants at the 14th University of Lagos (UNLAG) Research Fair and Conference have called for the inclusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the curriculum of tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Their recommendation was contained in a communique read by the Director, Academic planning unit, UNILAG, Prof Obinna Chukwu at the end of the Fair last Friday. They also seek greater collaborations between tertiary institutions and industry, as well as more creativity in acquiring skills within the school system. Reading the communique at the closing ceremony, Chukwu said: “Researches in academia that cut across all disciplines should partner with industries to build competencies in AI adoption; Higher education should help their students compete in AI age by including it in their curriculum. “Educational system should be more creative, and skills driven, emphasis should be more on skills acquisition through the manipulation of analytical technology. Stating other recommendations, Chukwu also said that there should be a proposed model of the operation of an e-health system for the treatment of Tuberculosis (TB) in rural communities in rural areas. He said the proposition is as a result of the observation that TB has been reported to be the second leading reason for loss of lives aside the human immune-deficiency virus (HIV). Speaking on the transportation sector, Chukwu said e-mobile technology should be adopted to improve its quality. “Public-private partnership as the best business case for cost effective gradual deployment of innovative ITS, e-mobile technology for a better, safer and smarter transportation system in Nigeria”, he said. The Research Fair had over 400 participants from universities within and outside Nigeria with 168 oral paper presentations and 49 poster presentations.
