 Nigeria born ex-footballer Andrew Akingbaje has been jailed and given the tag of “danger to Women” after he was caught on camera in front of a club in London viciously punching a lady. Twenty four year Akingbaje was sentenced by Inner London Crown Court after admitting the attack on 21-year-old Krystal Mission outside a South London nightclub in the early hours of New Year’s Day 2019. The brutal assault according to the Mail was caught on camera and footage showed shocked revellers watching on as the former footballer rained down punches on Miss Mission before fleeing the scene The fracas kicked off due to a ‘queue-jumping’ row between Miss Mission and her friends and a group of women wearing blue wigs who later approached Akingbaje before the assault. Miss Mission told the court she now suffers panic attacks and says she has been too frightened to go out in London since. Akingbaje previously pleaded guilty to one count of ABH having disputed some facts, claiming he had been provoked and spat on by the victim. The father-of-one, from Brixton, previously played for non-league Peckham Town and had trials at Accrington Stanley. Mitigating, Bethany Condron said: ‘He accepts that there were two assaults and he accepts responsibility for them.’ Two other counts of assault by beating against two of Miss Mission’s friend were ordered to lie in file. Sentencing Akingbaje to 32 months in prison, Judge Mark Bishop branded him a danger to women. Akingbaje also had previous convictions for drugs and domestic abuse and was handed an 18-month jail sentence for wounding his partner in 2017.
