The police in Ogun State have arrested three suspected highway robbers alleged to have terrorised Odogbolu/Ijebu-Ode Expressway. Johnson Afokolu, Victor Michael and Jacob Usang were arrested on Saturday morning by a police patrol team that saw them allegedly taking position to attack early travellers.
The suspects were said to have attempted to flee when they sighted the policemen but were chased and apprehended. It was gathered that a toy gun, knife, phones, substances suspected to be Marijuana, military accoutrements and torches were from them. “They confessed to have been responsible for most armed robbery cases in the area and that other members of the gang usually joined them on special operations,” said police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP). He said the Commissioner of Police Bashir Makama has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for discreet investigation while massive manhunt for their accomplices have commenced.
