Sequel to the last week’s  attack on former Deputy Senate President, Senator  Ike Ekweremadu, by suspected members of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB ) in Nuremberg, Germany, the German government has requested it be notified by the Federal Government of visits by government officials and other dignitaries. The Head of Information Section of Nigerian Embassy in Germany, Peter Lambat, disclosed this in an interview with The Nation on Thursday evening. He said: “The German government has advised that it be informed of visits of Nigerian/government dignitaries (VIPs) to enable provision of security coverage. “Additionally, on the IPOB threats, the government informed that the German Secret Service and the Police have been fully briefed for necessary action and to ensure that there’s no future reoccurrence of what happened at Nuremberg on 17th August, 2019.” Contrary to reports that four suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident, Lambat said no arrest has been made, adding: “It is not true. There’s no such information as police investigations are ongoing and have not yielded any results so far. “The German authorities have clarified that against the initial misinformation, the German Police is still investigating the matter with a view to identifying the culprits.”
