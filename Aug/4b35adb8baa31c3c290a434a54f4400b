There is nothing like a touch of black and white dress to give you a sparkling effect. It is the queen of design at the moment. The black and white attires are in a class of their own.  Whether as a top or gown, or as a spaghetti strap, it’s now a must-have item among young and old fashionistas. There is no doubt it is the hottest dress for the season; it’s hot and haute. The designs and artwork on most of these dresses are sexy, classic and stylish. The colour combinations and intricate designs add just the right touch. They are everywhere and in several imaginative styles and fabrics that include flirty eyelets to well tailored dinner gowns. Black and white attires can be used to dress up or down, it all depends on the design, occasion and the way they are combined. For the best result, pair your white top with jeans or trousers (three quarter or cropped) and for a solid casual look put it on a snazzy skirt for a night out. Whether you are going clubbing, partying or just hanging out with friends for fun, a black and white dress is just for you.
