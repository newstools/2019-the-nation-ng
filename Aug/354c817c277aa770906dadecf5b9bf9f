Oil workers have urged the Federal Government to put in place, policies that will translate to massive job creation in the country. Acting under the aegis of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), they said its only when jobs are created that criminal activities would be reduced. Speaking with The Nation, its National President, Comrade Williams Akporeha, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that all relevant agencies are compelled to implement the relevant Executive Orders without delay so as to foster value addition in the nationâ€™s human capital development and utilisation of material resources and services. He also appealed that the application of local content law should be geared towards the creation of decent jobs for Nigerians. Akporeha argued that casualisation of jobs, especially in the oil and gas industry, was appalling and disturbing in view of the high expectations and premium it placed on the Nigeria Content Development and Management Board (NCDMB) since its creation.
