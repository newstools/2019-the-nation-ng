 President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) Daniel Igali has assured that the Nations wrestlers will battle to the finish in their quest for glory in Morocco. While hinting that the team may not garner as many medals as it did at the last edition in Brazzaville, no effort however will be spared in trying to make the nation proud. The federation according to him is constrained to take only 16 wrestlers out of 23 that are good to go as only those in the Olympic Games weight categories have been chosen. Reduction in the number according to him is sure to limit the level of medal haul but added that with determination those on parade will rise to the occasion. “We are taking just 16 wrestlers to the event, we may not get as many medals as we did the last time but we will certainly do our best,” he enthused. The Sydney Olympics Gold medalist expressed hope that the contribution of the Wrestlers will as usual rub off positively on the final performance by Team Nigeria. Wrestling has continued to be a major medal hopeful for Nigerian contingent to the African Games, the commonwealth Games among other meets. Nigeria won the wrestling event at the Brazzaville 2015 with 19 medals, comprising 9 gold, 5 silver and 5 bronze medals. Recall that Team Nigeria finished overall second with 144 medals, 73 medals behind winners Egypt who led with 217 medals and 22 medals better than South Africa who finished third with 122 medals made up of 41 Gold 41 Silver and 40 Bronze. Nigeria will be participating in 23 sports at the Games in Morocco.
