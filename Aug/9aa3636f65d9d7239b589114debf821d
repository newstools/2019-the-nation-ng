FOUNDER of High Tower Prayer Ministry, Ipaja, Lagos State, Prophet Olawale Ikotun, has said that the solution to Nigeria’s problems is prayers. The clergyman said the country as a hub for churches in sub-Saharan Africa stood at an advantage to resolve socio-economic and political issues through prayers by men of God. Prophet Ikotun made the remarks at a press briefing to announce programmes marking his church’s 10th anniversary staring from tomorrow. He noted that the government at the centre had not utilised the presence of men of God enough in solving numerous problems confronting the country. He disclosed that activities lined up to mark the anniversary will commence tomorrow with a three-day revival ‘’Mighty man of Jacob’’ and end on September 3. According to Prophet Ikotun, the revival will be used to offer prayers for the country and redeem those who are being hampered by evil forces. “Workers’ conference will take place from September 2 to 5 with scriptural ministration by Pastor Yemi Adetona, while Covenant Day of Possibility  will hold on September 6. There will  be a propehetic hour tagged ‘Grace for Continuity’ on September 10, ‘Source of Calling’ on September 12 and ‘Pride of a Woman,’ among others,” he said.
