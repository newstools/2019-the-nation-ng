 Junior international and Liverpool winger Taiwo Awoniyi was in action for five minutes on Saturday as Mainz05 suffered a 3-0 defeat away to Freiburg in the Germany Bundesliga. Awoniyi who began a season loan deal with Mainz early this month, was brought in as replacement for Edimilson Fernandes in the 85th minute with Mainz already two goals down. The former Olympic team ace had hardly settled down when rampaging Freiburg took the goal tally to three thanks to homeboy Gian-Luca Waldschmidt who converted an 87th minute penalty. Although Awoniyi and his teammates managed to mount pressures on their hosts and retaining a 49 to 51 possession ratio they however failed to remedy the situation as Freiburg remained resolute gingered by their teeming home supporters. The three goals scored by the homers came within seven minutes. Awoniyi who joined Liverpool in 2015, has since been on loan to five clubs beginning with FSV Frankfurt, and stopping over at NEC, Royal Excel Mouscron, Gent and finally Mainz. The 22 year old has made cumulative 85 appearances for the loan clubs scoring 19 goals in the bargain.
