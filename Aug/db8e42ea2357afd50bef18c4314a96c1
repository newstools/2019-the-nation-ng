Traders and shop owners in the Badagry Roundabout International Garage and Shopping Complex have been called upon to vacate the market to pave the way for the reconstruction of a new complex to be known as Badagry  Ultra Modern International Shopping Complex. The Chairman of the Badagry Local Government, Hon Olusegun Onilude, made the call during the commencement of work on the new project during the week. He said the local government had provided a temporary site within a short distance away from the shopping complex billed for demolition to relocate the affected traders in order not to disrupt the economic activities in the area. Onilude noted that the reconstruction of the market was borne out of his desire to upgrade infrastructural facilities in the ancient city which is an international gateway to West African countries. The council boss noted that “our administration is mindful of the inconveniences the demolition of the current shops may cause the occupiers. We have made adequate provisions to relocate the affected traders to a temporary site pending the completion of the project. To further ameliorate the inconveniences, the demolition of shops and relocation of the affected traders shall be done in phases in order to avoid the problems that may arise, if all the shops are to be demolished at a time. To this end, all affected persons are hereby required to vacate their shops immediately to give way for a new, better organized modern garage and shopping complex.” Onilude pointed out that the shops, which are expected to be completed within 24 months, will first be distributed to the displaced traders  at  affordable prices. He appealed to the traders to cooperate with the local government in order to facilitate the completion of the project within the stipulated time frame.
