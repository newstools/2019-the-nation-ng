RESIDENTS of Abule Ijesha, Abule Oja and Akoka in Lagos Mainland on Monday marched on the premises of Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IE), Ikorodu Road, near Obanikoro bus stop. They protested against high rate of electricity tariff. The protesters were led by a community leader, Alhaji Sanusi Olawale. They condemned the ‘crazy bills’ given to them by IE. Sanusi alleged: “We are here to say no to the high electricity bill given to us and also to say no to the sending of electricity bills to residents through text messages, as it a form of exploitation. Enough is enough.” Mr. James Gbenga, a representative from Abule Ijesha community, alleged that the Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company was  exploiting residents through ‘crazy bills’. “We say no to ‘crazy bills’ and injustice.” Mr. Hassan, an Akoka resident, said N5000 was the initial amount he paid monthly as electricity bill, but recently it was increased to N28,000. “The bill these people bring to us is alarming, from N5,000 to N28,000 in less than six months. We want them to come and disconnect the light, we don’t need their service anymore.  We have our children’s tuition fees to pay, house rent is there and other bills are also on our neck,” he said. An official of the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the protesters that the IE has taken note of their grievances. He promised to convene a meeting to address the problem.
