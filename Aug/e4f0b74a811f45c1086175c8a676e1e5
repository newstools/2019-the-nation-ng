Former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has advised his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, to avoid policies that will take the state backward. Okorocha urged him to borrow a leaf from his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, and desist from attacking his legacies, with the sole aim of getting accolades from his party members. The former governor, who was reacting to the setting up of a Judicial Panel of Inquiry to review land acquisition and allocation between 2006 and 2019, described it as another ploy to malign him. A statement by his Media Adviser, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, said the decision was in bad faith. He said: “Looking at the members of the panel, who are card-carrying members of the PDP, and their terms of reference, one would have no other option than to conclude that the governor has his target or mission, which is to continue his vendetta against the past APC government in the state and the man who headed it, Senator Rochas Okorocha. “Governor Ihedioha has set up more than 14 committees and panels since he became governor and each of the committees or panels has one or two specific assignments to carry out and all against the APC government, which Senator Okorocha had led. For instance, the Prof. Jude Njoku’s education committee took no other action than to take over the PPP-oriented Eastern Palm University and also scrapped the six new Universities, four new Polytechnics and three new Colleges of Education built by Okorocha”. Okorocha added: “The panel on infrastructure made no other recommendation than to give the governor the licence to demolish some of the prime projects of the former governor like the flyovers, tunnels and waterfalls.”
