The official confirmed that the court has been informed about the development and that a Deputy Registrar visited the hospital, and was told that the judge actually left his room. The source said: “I am aware the family has not officially informed the court about the development. “A Deputy Registrar was at the hospital earlier today (Monday) and confirmed that the judge was admitted in the hospital, but actually left is room on Saturday. “I cannot confirm the name of the hospital at the moment. I know the court is working with relevant agencies on this. I will get back as soon as there are new developments.” Justice Saleh, from Yobe State, as published in the court’s website, was born on June 23, 1965, and had his primary and secondary school education in Yobe. He graduated from the University of Maiduguri in 1992 and the Nigerian Law School in 1993.
