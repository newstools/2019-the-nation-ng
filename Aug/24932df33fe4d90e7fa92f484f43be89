Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has taken over a block of flats belonging to the former governor of Cross River, Donald Duke, in Ikoyi. A Federal High Court in Lagos had ordered AMCON and United Bank for Africa (UBA) to seize property of Donald Duke over an alleged N537,334,360.77 debt. Vacation judge Justice Chuka Obiozor also authorised AMCON and UBA to, in the interim, take possession of funds in the accounts of Duke and others in any bank.
