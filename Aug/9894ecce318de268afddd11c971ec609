The Ekiti State Government has assured applicants that the ongoing recruitment of teachers into its primary schools will be fair and transparent. Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi said applicants would be given a level-playing ground in the recruitment exercise being conducted by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB). Egbeyemi spoke in his office at the weekend while receiving in audience the executive of the state council of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by the chairman, Mr. Olatunde Kolapo. The deputy governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, pledged the readiness of the state government to consider qualified applicants for the teaching jobs without interfering in the exercise. Egbeyemi noted that the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration would not rest on its oars in reducing unemployment among the youths to make them useful to the society. He also added that the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) would soon invite applications for teaching jobs in secondary schools to fill the available vacancies therein. On arrears of workers’ salaries, Egbeyemi noted that government was working out means of defraying the arrears left behind by the last administration and would not relent in the regular payment of salaries, pensions and gratuities as and when due. Kolade hailed the Fayemi administration for the regular payment of workers’ salaries, retirees’ pensions and increment in the monthly savings for the payment of gratuities from N10 million to N100 million monthly. The NLC chief appealed to government to fulfil its promise in the payment of salary arrears, leave bonuses and implementation of workers’ promotion.
