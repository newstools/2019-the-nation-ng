The family of Mrs. Anna Ejiofor shot and killed by suspected kidnappers in Ikwerre area of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, has urged the security agencies to fish out her killers and make them face the consequences of their action. Family sources said Mrs. Ejiofor’s son Tobechukwu Andrew Ejiofor, Managing Director of Homes of Success Agro Farms Nigeria Limited, was kidnapped in 2017 then rescued by police. On July 4, this year, some gunmen presumed to be the ones who earlier kidnapped Tobechukwu, returned to the home of the Ejiofors at No 27, Pius Street Omademe in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state demanding to see Tobechukwu and his wife Latai. Rummaging through virtually everything in the house and failing to find the couple, the gunmen reportedly shot 78-year-old Mrs. Anna Ejiofor in the head. She died immediately. The Ejiofor’s home was also set on fire. It was gathered that other occupants of the house and neighbours took to their heels on hearing the assailants’ gunfire. The anti-kidnapping unit of the police who are still investigating the incident are yet to apprehend the kidnappers, said the family members. The Ejiofors have sustained their prayers for God to bring the perpetrators of this evil to book within a short time. They have also asked the relevant authorities to apprehend the killers of their matriarch
