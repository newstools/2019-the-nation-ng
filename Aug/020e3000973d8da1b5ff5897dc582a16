President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of victims who lost their lives, as well as those whose property perished due to havoc wreaked by flash floods, rainstorm, windstorm and fire incidents across the country. He spoke following the updated brief he received from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) over the incidents. In order to ameliorate the negative effects of these natural and in some cases, avoidable disasters, the President has also directed NEMA to immediately provide relief assistance to the affected persons and communities in all the geo-political zones of the country. Going forward, President Buhari, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, also appealed to Nigerians to without further hesitation, heed early warning instructions by relevant government agencies intended to avert the negative consequences of such natural occurrences in the country. He said “It is important that our people listen and immediately comply with early-warning alerts and forecast by government bodies in order to save lives and property from wanton destruction. As the saying goes, ‘a stitch in time saves nine.’”
