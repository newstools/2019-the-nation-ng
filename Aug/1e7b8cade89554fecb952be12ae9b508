But Dickson, who spoke shortly after casting his vote at Oruere-wari polling unit 05, ward 2 in Toru Orua, Sagbama local government area of the state, said over 30 political parties participated in the exercise. The governor said contrary to concerns raised about the council election in the state,  security reports indicated that the exercise was peaceful and hitch-free. He expressed satisfaction at the large turnout of voters and urged the electorate to conduct themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner in electing candidates and parties of their choice. The governor recalled the boycott of the council poll by the APC but noted that over 30 political parties contested the exercise and expressed optimism that the election would end  peacefully. He said: “Report from the security commanders across the state have given me the overview which does not indicate any major concern. “Our hope and expectation is that this exercise will end peacefully just as it has started on a peaceful and orderly note. “The major opposition party in the state on their own decided to boycott the election but there are still over 30 political parties that presented candidates for the election and so it will be a contested election. “But at the end of the day, i call on all persons to vote according to their conscience in an orderly and peaceful manner.”
