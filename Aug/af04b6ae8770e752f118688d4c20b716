Amid preparations for Ed-eil-Kabir, the Lagos State Government on Wednesday spoke of the need for a clean environment during the celebration. Addressing reporters at Alausa, Ikeja Permanent Secretary (PS), Ministry of the Environment Abiodun Bamgboye, urged Lagosians to keep their environment clean, as they celebrate. He implored them to dispose of animal waste properly, bag their refuse and put them at designated points. Bamigboye said everything would be done to rid Lagos of refuse under the sanitation Intervention Programme (SIP). The PS said: “To prevent outbreak of epidemics, residents must always ensure that they handle waste in the most appropriate way.” He said the law against street trading was still on, warning against the display of rams on major highways, road medians, lay-bys, gardens and parks. Bamigboye said the sales of rams must be done without defacing the state or compromising the well-being of Lagosians.
