Ahead of Friday’s battle for Gold against Burkina Faso at the ongoing  Africa Games in Rabat, Flying Eagles head Coach Paul Aigbogun has told his boys to resist the temptation to leave any room for mistakes that can be capitalised upon. He praised the boys for rising to the occasion so far by making it all the way to the finals, but added that everything must be done to end on a golden note. “You have done well so far but the battle is not finished.  We must all work very hard in this last game to carry the day,” he submitted. Aigbogun who led the team to unimpressive run at the recently held FIFA U-20 World cup in Poland insisted that emerging victorious in Rabat will be a bit of a consolation. Friday opponents Burkina Faso created an upset by defeating defending champions Senegal in the second match on Tuesday, holding the young Teranga Lions 1-1 before emerging victorious on 5-4 penalty same margin with which Nigeria defeated Mali. Senegal and Mali will slug it out today (Thursday) in the third place or Bronze medal match. It is the second meeting between the two sides who had earlier clashed in the group stage in a goalless draw. Some analysts have predicted that today’s bronze match will be full of fireworks as both teams fight to avoid missing the medals podium. Interestingly Nigeria and Burkina Faso will settle for Gold and Silver respectively on Friday, had equally met in the group stage with the encounter ending 1-1. The duo of Ahmad Ghali and Kalifa Nikiema who scored for their sides in the encounter will be hoping to replicate their performance on Friday. The Nigeria versus Burkina Faso match will come up at 5pm.
