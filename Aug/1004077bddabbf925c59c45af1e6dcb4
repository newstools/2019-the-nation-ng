An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Thursday adjourned till October 27 and 30 the trial of six ex-employees of CHISCO Group of Companies, including the chairman’s brother, who allegedly defrauded the firm of N634million. Mr B. I. Bakare fixed the long adjournment because magistrates of the Lagos State Judiciary are going on retreat in September. The first to fourth defendants are: Henry Uwalaka, 48, Chukwudi Ezeoma, 42, Stephen Okeke, 55 and 42-year-old Mrs. Nonye Obianwu. The fifth and sixth defendants are: 47-year-old Nonso Anyeagbu, who is a brother to the Chairman, CHISCO Group of Companies, Chief Anyeagbu, and 56-year-old Essang Okon. They were arraigned early in the year on a 23-count charge of conspiracy and fraud, before Mr B.I. Bakare. They pleaded not guilty and were granted bail. According to the charge, the defendants committed the offences between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 at 104, Funsho Williams Avenue, Iponri, Costain, Lagos. The court heard that they and others on the run conspired and stole the sum, contrary to Section 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. Henry Uwalaka and Chukwudi Ezeoma were alleged to have stolen N13.1million by inflating prices of vehicle particulars from N20,000 to N56,000, property of CHISCO Group of Companies. The duo allegedly stole N26 million by inflating prices of 642 vehicle emblems from N4,500 to N45,000, property of CHISCO, being their employers, contrary to Section 285(7). Both Henry Uwalaka and Chukwudi Ezeoma were also alleged to have stolen N16.4million meant for vehicle recovery expenses and another N329 million unlawful debit from excess usage of Automated Gas Oil (AGO), property of CHISCO. Okeke and others allegedly stole 134 motor batteries valued at N6million by negligently allowing those stolen items pass through the gates they manned as security officers.
