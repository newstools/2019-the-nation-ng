ACE fashion designer and social media personality, Toyin Lawani, has revealed why she would marry three different men with her money as soon as she clocks 40 . Lawani who is in her late 30’s revealed this via her Instagram post. She said since a man can conveniently marry three wives, she sees no reason why a woman should not do the same. ”If men can, why can’t I?” she argued. “Don’t tell me bullshit that it’s a man’s world. What a man can do a woman can do better. The world is changing so men need to sit up. Una fuck up don too much. If you like don’t be loyal, I will marry another one and replace you. Women should be respected worldwide. Men can never give birth to kids, and I know yea, women can’t get pregnant without men but we can buy sperm.” The stylist added that if a woman is rich, she can marry any kind of man of her choice. “Women need to start taking the bulls by the horns. See, owo nikoko. If you have money, you will marry any type of man you want. When he cheats, replace his ass. Ladies, double up your hustle and get that money. “A woman will carry baby for you a whole nine months, dedicate two years of their life to the baby’s care, before she can even work again, you go still cheat on her,” she posted on her Instagram handle.
