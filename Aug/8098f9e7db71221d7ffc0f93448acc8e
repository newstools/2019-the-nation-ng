Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, also joined Oyo State government, Olubadan Council of Chiefs, royal family and indigenes in saluting Oba Adetunjiâ€™s visionary and purposeful leadership, which consistently promotes peaceful and harmonious co-existence and respect for religions and diverse cultures. As the 41st Olubadan clocks 91, the President believed Oba Adetunji has successfully carried on with the legacies of his forefathers, dating back to the 16th century, with an intentional focus to uphold the beautiful traditions of hospitality, respect for authorities and communal development that has always defined the throne.
