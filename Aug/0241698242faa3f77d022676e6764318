Following prevalent cases Lassa fever and other viral deceases among pupils in both public and private schools in the country, teachers in Anambra State have promised to promote hygiene education in schools. Over 80 teachers, comprising of Directors, Education Secretaries from the 21 local government areas of the state, Area Education Officers, and others made the pledge during a one-day sensitization seminar in Awka, the state capital. They also resolved to improve sanitation and protection of the school environment. Addressing participants during the occasion, Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof Kate Omenugha, underscored the need for proper maintenance of hygiene among teachers and pupils in all schools in the state. She regretted that the culture of hand-washing and sterilizing which was effectively practiced during the period of the dreaded Ebola disease, was gradually dwindling among pupils, stressing the need to revive it again. “This workshop is to further create awareness on the necessity of maintaining hygiene and sanitation among our stakeholders in various public and private schools across the state,” she said. Prof Omenugha said the teachers were strategically selected in view of their regular contact with pupils. Delivering a paper on Preventive Measures for Lassa Viral Hemorrhagic Disease, one of the resource persons, Dr. Tony Okwukaogu, described the disease as endemic and on the rise, calling for deliberate efforts on environmental cleanliness and protection. Earlier, Acting Director, Education Services Department, Lady Vera Ogbalu, was confident that the exercise would go a long way to assisting in checkmating the spread of the disease among teachers, students and pupils in the state.
