Barely four days after its launch by Governor Dapo Abiodun, over 25,000 unemployed people have registered with the Ogun State Government Job Portal. The Special Adviser to the Governor on jobs creation, Mr. Lekan Olude, disclosed that a “whopping 24,815 had registered as at Monday afternoon.” This was made known by Kunle Somorin, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Dapo Abiodun, in a statement. Olude added that following calls by a cross section of the state that the jobs portal was malfunctioning, the Governor ordered that all glitches be cleared. “I can confirm to you that the portal works seamlessly now and in spite of the pressure and number of applicants, registration goes on on a minute-by-minute basis. “The diversity of applications received is also overwhelming. They cut across careers, ages and ethnic backgrounds. People have applied from all over the country and beyond. “Artisans and craftsmen and women should also know that we expect them to also register as we are planning tons of programmes for their empowerment,”Olude said. He stated government has started analysing the profiles and would in a couple of weeks start matching those on the database and linking them with prospective employers. He noted that Abiodun is a man of vision, and would not settle for anything less than quality, adding that the governor decided to officially launch the portal alongside the Vice President because of the premium placed on youth employment and human capital development. He also enjoined those who had issues registering earlier to go back online and complete their applications. Olude, a co-founder of Jobberman, Africa’ urged those who are complaining about the site to be patient, and follow the same process which helped the over 25,000 that had registered. According to him, the government had placed the management of the portal in the hands of very competent professionals who are worthy partners in the building the future together agenda.
