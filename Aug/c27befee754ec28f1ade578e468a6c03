Task Hospitality Ltd Chairman,  Sikiru Rufai has advised business organisations to embrace opportunities digital technology offers for optimal growth. He spoke at the the 2019 Lagos Digital Transmission Summit, organised by the Institute of Enterprise Management and Analytics (IEMA), in Lagos. The event brought together government representatives, business leaders, the academia, and technology-driven companies. He said for businesses to thrive competitively, individual and corporate organisations must identify their level of operation and core competencies and adopt digital applications where it has comparative advantage and grow in that direction. According to him, digital transformation is indispensable for everyone, adding that anyone who does not think along digital will crash because digital transformation is the future. “We must embrace  digital trasnformation in line with our level of operations and our destination, though it’s a process but we must key in,” he said. Rufai said innovation is key for all to be relevant, adding that the government must redefine the education curriculum to match with future demands in the business world. He said: “We all have roles to play, the government on whose shoulders rest the onus to show practical commitment should not be found wanting to deliver as expected, then corporate organisations and individuals must do their bids to meet up the challenges ahead of us because the world is moving fast.”
