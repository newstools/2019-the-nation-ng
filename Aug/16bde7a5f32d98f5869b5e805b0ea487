Popular Afro beats singer and songwriter, Augustine Kelechi, also known as Tekno, has released a music video titled “Agege” and featuring Zanku pioneer, Zlatan. Despite the ongoing investigations as regards the controversial music video, the video shows scenes of four strippers’ pole-dancing in a moving van on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos. He was seen throwing money at the semi-nude young women. The viral video of Tekno and the dancers was met with criticisms by the Government and members of the public. Tekno had, in a statement on his official Instagram account, claimed that the viral video was as a result of logistical issues experienced during the shoot. He had said, “There was no reason for us to be dancing in a truck around Lekki. There was no music and ventilation in the truck. “We were shooting a music video and we had a shortage of vehicles to convey people to the next location, because some of the cars broke down in between the shoot. We divided ourselves into various vehicles, because we had been shooting all day and having fun; we then moved to the next location. “We sincerely apologise if some people saw this and felt offended by the scenery. It was never my intention.”
