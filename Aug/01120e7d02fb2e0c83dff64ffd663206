Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is expected to grace today’s grand finale of the 2019 ITTF Challenge Plus Nigeria Open at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Number one seed, Aruna Quadri of Nigeria zoomed into the semifinal of the men singles after a convincing 4-0 win over Brazil’s Thiago Monteiro. He will face a familiar foe in India’s Ghosh Soumyajit today. According to Executive Chairman, Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), Dr Kweku Tandoh, the sports-loving governor will attend the finale as he is committed to sports development in the state and Africa at large. Dr. Tandoh said: “I can confirm to you that our sports-loving governor will be part of the grand finale of Africa’s elite table tennis tournament. This is another confirmation of his commitment at ensuring that Lagos becomes the sports hub of Africa. “The annual Nigeria Open is growing every year and the presence of the Number One Citizen in Lagos is a confirmation of the interest of the governor in empowering youth through sports. The governor had earlier in the week received officials of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) in his office during which he also assured them of the state’s commitment to Nigeria Open, which has become a model for others in the world,” Tandoh said. In the last 10 days, Lagos had hosted major tournaments in the ITTF calendar starting with the African Club Championships and followed by the ITTF Africa Cup, climaxing with the 2019 ITTF Challenge Plus Nigeria Open. Tandoh said hosting these tournaments was another sporting milestone for the state with over 200 players from 40 countries within and outside Africa visiting Lagos, stressing that it was another way to promote sports tourism.
