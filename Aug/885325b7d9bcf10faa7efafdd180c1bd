A POPULAR bible verse quotes God as saying that He would have mercy on whom He would have mercy. Although President Muhammadu Buhari is a Muslim, he would appear to have keyed into this bible verse with respect to the appointment of one of the recently sworn-in ministers. Like a cat with nine lives, the new minister was said to have survived three different attempts made by some power brokers to remove his name from the list of ministerial nominees because President Buhari insisted on each occasion that his name be restored on the list. The new minister himself was said to have been surprised that his name survived on the list after the numerous attempts made by the power brokers in question to remove it. The irony of it all is that the minister, who hails from one of the northern states, eventually played a key role helping the President to assign portfolios. So much so that those who had wanted his name removed from the ministerial list started running after him to seek favour. A case of the stone the builder rejected becoming the head of the corner.
