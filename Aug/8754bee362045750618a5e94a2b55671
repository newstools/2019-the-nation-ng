The decomposing body of a 16-year-old girl allegedly raped to death by suspected hoodlums in Isale Ijeun area of Idi Ape in Abeokuta, Ogun State, has been found in a bush in the neighbourhood. Aishat Shodeinde was allegedly abducted on Friday, August 16th while returning home by some unidentified men who proceeded to  gang-rape  her to death in the  bush. Aishat was, until her tragic death, an SS3 student at an unnamed secondary school. She was simultaneously undergoing training as an auxiliary nurse   in a hospital in the neighbourhood. Sources said she had repeatedly turned down love advances from one of the suspected hoodlums. A search party was launched to find her  soon after her relations realized that she had been unusually  away from home for too long. Her corpse was found near a rock by members of  the So Safe Corps when they raided a joint operated by hemp smokers near the bush. The matter was reported to a police division at Itoku area of Abeokuta but nothing was done to apprehend the culprits. A source said: “We learnt the girl was accosted by the hoodlums while she was returning home and they forcibly took her to the bush and gang-raped her to death. “The  police divisional headquarters at Oke Itoku was duly informed about the incident but their search for Aishat’s whereabouts did not yield fruits. “It was the operatives of So Safe Corps who raided a hemp smoking joint that recovered her body after they perceived odour from the bush near the joint.’’ A source said that four suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident. Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi did not respond to enquiries sent to his mobile phone at press time. He also did not   pick his phone when he was called.
