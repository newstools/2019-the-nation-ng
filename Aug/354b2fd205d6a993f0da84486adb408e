Mavin president, Donjazzy, during the week gifted 10 fans and followers with a 3.5Kva generator each to help upgrade their businesses. He did via his Twitter account. Donjazzy tweeted: “Ok guys as promised I have received the 10 generators. It’s just 3.5Kva. So abeg if you need the ones bigger than this wait for another time sir/ma. I hope that this really helps take your business to the next level. “I am off to another meeting so I won’t be able to pick the winners myself. But my good friend @deejaybign will be picking the winners. So pls follow @deejaybign and tell him why to pick you using the #TheDonsBlessings” Fans and followers then headed to the Twitter handle of Mavins official disc jockey, DJ BigN, giving him reasons why they needed the generator. Thereafter, DJ Big N selected 10 winners of the generators and posted it on his Twitter handle. One of the winners, @Crownwealth_, while showing gratitude, tweeted his appreciation at Donjazzy and DJ Big N thus: “Brand New TIGMAX Generator just arrive in my office.
