An original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Vivo, said it plans to expand into the Middle East and African (MEA) markets and launch its latest Y series smartphones in the region. As part of its global expansion, Vivo’s products are now available in united Arab Emirates (UAE) and Morocco. Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are to follow suit in the coming months. Speaking on the plan, its  Senior Vice President, Spark Ni, said MEA is important to the firm’s growth plan. “Since our first entry into international markets in 2014, we have been dedicated to understanding the needs of consumers through in-depth research in an effort to bring innovative products and services to meet changing lifestyle needs,” he said. He added:”MEA markets are important to us, and we will tailor our approach with consumers’ needs in mind. The launch of Y series is just the beginning. We look forward to bringing our other widely popular products beyond Y series to consumers in the MEA very soon.” Building on the success of its popular V15 and NEX in markets across Asia, which has propelled its return to the world’s top five smartphone makers, according to IDC, Vivo is continuing its mission to bring innovative and stylish products to more consumers around the world.
