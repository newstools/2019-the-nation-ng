Newly signed Barcelona goalkeeper Neto is expected to be out for 6-8 weeks after undergoing operation for a fracture in the scaphoid of his left hand. The surgery was performed successfully on Tuesday morning. The goalkeeper was Barcaâ€™s second signing this summer, after Frenkie de Jong, and participated in the first four pre-season friendlies. The Brazilian arrived from Valencia and was officially introduced as a new player for Barcelona on July 9. In the first of the two matches played against Napoli, Neto completed an almost perfect match, repeatedly stopping the Italians from scoring.
