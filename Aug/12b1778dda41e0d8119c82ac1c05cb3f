Inter and Man Utd confirm Alexis Sanchez joins Inter on loan. The Chilean has joined the Nerazzurri from Manchester United on a loan deal that will last until 30 June 2020. The Chile international has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and departs after a miserable two-and-a-half-year spell at the club that has seen him score just three Premier League goals. Much was expected of the former Arsenal star after he completed a switch to United in the January transfer window in 2018 â€“ a deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan head in the opposite direction. But injuries and a lack of form have curtailed his progress, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sanctioning a loan exit as he puts faith in an attacking line that includes the likes of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James.
