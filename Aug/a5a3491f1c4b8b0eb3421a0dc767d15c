The Federal Government, through its Rural Electrification Agency (REA) will, today, inaugurate the 80 kilowatt (KW) solar hybrid mini-grid power plant at Upake in Ajaokuta Local Government of Kogi State. REA’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Mrs. Damilola Ogunbiyi, who spoke at the weekend in Abuja, said 496 residential and commercial buildings would be connected and enjoy constant electricity supply. She said 12 communities would be energised and 19,000 Solar Home Systems (SHS) deployed under the first call of the Rural Electrification Fund (REF). Ogunbiyi added that the government would provide electricity for all Nigerian, to increase power access to everyone. She said the move was in line with the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to ensure electricity was available to all Nigerians. She said: “Families and businesses at Upake will now …access power… This will enhance productivity and create jobs.” Other communities set to soon inaugurate solar hybrid mini grids include Kare, Dadin-Kowa and Tsulaye communities in Kebbi State, as well as Akpabom community in Akwa Ibom State. REA is tasked with electrification of unserved and underserved communities. It provides equitable access to electricity across the country to maximise the economic, social and environmental benefits of rural electrification grants, as well as promote off-grid electrification and stimulate innovative approaches to rural electrification. Its projects are administered using a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model.
