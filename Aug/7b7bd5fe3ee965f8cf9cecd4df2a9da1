Immediate past Executive Secretary of Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) and Minister of state, Environment, Bar. Sharon Ikeazor has warned pensioners against falling prey to fraudsters. Ikeazor gave the warning on Wednesday during the commissioning of the liaison office in Awka, Anambra State. She urged them to avoid dealing with unauthorized persons in the name of facilitating the resolution of their complaints and payment of their entitlements. “Always contact us at our offices or through our various channels to reach us for your issues. We’ve dedicated telephone lines you to contact us,” she said. According to the Minister, the idea of a state liaison office was to bring the world class pension services to the doorsteps of pensioners. “We also want to discourage and stop our senior citizens from traveling long distances to get their complaints or other issues resolved,” she added. Appreciating the governor of the state, Willie Obiano for allocating space for the organization, Ikeazor urged the retirees to take advantage of the facilities to better their lots. Earlier, the Executive secretary of PTAD, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme applauded the numerous legacies of her predecessor, pledging to build on her achievements. She said, “Before, pensioners come with mats to collect their entitlements as they have to sleep waiting to be attended to. “There was no dignity, rather it was frustrating and humiliating for the retirees. “But the story is no longer the same today, especially when Bar. Ikeazor held sway. Pensioners cases were dispatched with speed.”
