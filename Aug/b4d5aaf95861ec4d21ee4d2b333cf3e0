A veteran journalist and former Pro-chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Alhaji Yakubu Mohammed, has said that Kogi State deserves a better governor. He obtained the Nomination and Expression of Interest Form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest the governorship primary at the weekend. Mohammed, who spoke with reporters after obtaining his form, lamented that Kogi State was gradually becoming the capital of poverty and thuggery in the country. He said: “We aspired for a state of excellence but what we have today is far from what we dreamed about.” The veteran journalist, however, said, Governor Yahaya Bello should not be blamed for the lack of performance, saying he could not have performed above his capacity. Mohammed, who is from Kogi East contested the 2015 primary ialongside Bello, James Ocholi, and the late Prince Abubakar Audu.
