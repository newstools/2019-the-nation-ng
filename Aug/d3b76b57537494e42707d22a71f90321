The Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Governor Ayodele Fayose on Monday exchanged verbal attacks over alleged plot to cause havoc in the state. The party alleged that Fayose has perfected plans to tinker with the state’s peaceful ambience by hiding under the celebration of the annual Udiroko cultural festival scheduled to hold today. But, the former governor denied the claims, describing the allegation as baseless and figment of the critics’ imagination. In a statement signed by the APC Director of Media and Publicity, Elder Sam Oluwalana, said: “We have it on good authority that a former governor of the state wants to hide under the Udiroko festival to attempt to launch himself back into the politics of the state, having failed woefully to achieve this through the ballot. “The former governor and his cohorts, having been traumatised by the gale of unprecedented achievements of the present administration of Dr. Kayode Fayemi, are now attempting to make a return to the politics of the state through the backdoor. Elder Oluwalana, who doubles as SSA Media (Party Matters) to Fayemi, advised the people not to allow themselves to be used by political marabouts in their quest to portray themselves as friends of the masses. But Fayose’s media aide, Mr. Lere Olayinka, said: “We are not in the habit of dignifying lowlife and people living with guilt of forcing themselves on Ekiti. “It is obvious that almost a year after manipulating themselves to power,  they are still afraid of the shadow of Ayo Fayose, a man whose footprints will remain on the sands of Ekiti forever. “Rather than jumping up and down spinning lies against Fayose, who is moving on with his life after serving Ekiti diligently, Governor Fayemi and his APC election riggers should concentrate on making meaningful impacts in the state.”
