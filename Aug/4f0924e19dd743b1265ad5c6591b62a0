It’s obvious that Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka did not solicit the unusual love that has been showered on him these past weeks as he celebrated his 85th birthday mid last month. Apart from newspaper reports that featured him regularly throughout the month of July, Soyinka had the sheer luck of being celebrated in different quarters by different groups at different venues. Some of the parties were privately held while some were full public show. One would not be surprised if the 85th birthday celebration of the literary icon is still on or about to be held in some other quarters. But the particular one that the Nobel Laureath will not forget in a hurry is the artistic show of love and deep regard that artist-soldier Gen. Babagana Monguro (rtd) displayed for him some days ago. The Borno State-born general and incumbent National Security Adviser presented a collection of artistic paintings he devotedly created by himself. They were different sketched portraits of the Nobel laureate presented to him in Lagos. An enthralled Soyinka, we heard, expressed great delight and thanked the amiable general for his unusual gesture. Soyinka said: “It’s fascinating and nice for the NSA Gen. Monguno to take time to make the sketches. I’m pleasantly surprised. Thank you General,” he said.
