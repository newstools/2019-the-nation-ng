The Ondo State Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has arrested Mr. Oluwomise Modupe for allegedly involving in the trafficking of Folashade Ogunfamuyide to Oman. Parading the suspect at the headquarters of the NIS in Akure, the state Commander of the NIS, Mrs. Eunice Aboyade-Yebovi, said the victim was innocently sold into slavery by the suspect. She said: “We arrested this trafficker. From our findings, we understand that he has been in the business for some time. He sent victims abroad to an Arabian country to some of his collaborators. They used the victims as ‘slaves’ and he made money from the business. “When this particular case was reported to us, we went into action and through our intelligence gathering, we traced the victim to Oman and we arranged how she would return from the Arabian country to Nigeria.” The commander said the suspect had been handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) for investigation and prosecution. She said: “We have been sensitising our people to let them know that the victims were being sold to slavery. Some of them are assaulted sexually and also face all sorts of maltreatment in the foreign land.” The suspect, Modupe, who admitted that he ran an agency for getting job, denied the allegation of being a human trafficker. He claimed that he assisted the victim to get a housemaid job in Oman. Said he: “The victim came to me to help her get a job abroad and I told her the type of job available. She agreed to do it. I didn’t lure her into it.”
