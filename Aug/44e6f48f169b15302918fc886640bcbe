Manchester United have reached an agreement to sign England centre-back Harry Maguire from Leicester for £80m – a world record fee for a defender. The 26-year-old is expected to complete a medical at the club at the weekend. He will become United’s third summer signing following Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, who arrived from Crystal Palace and Swansea respectively. “The clubs have agreed [a fee] and there’s still some work for it to go through,” said Brendan Rodgers. Speaking to Sky Sports, the Leicester boss added: “There’s still a bit to go in terms of Harry’s medical and whatever personal things to sort out, but it is what it is. “He’s a special player, he’s not a player that of course we would want to lose. “He’s a top-class player, he’s a good man as well, and everything about Harry over the course of this pre-season, he knows there has been interest over the summer and he’s been super professional.” Maguire made 69 Premier League appearances for Leicester after joining from Hull City in 2017. The deal means Maguire becomes the world’s most expensive defender, eclipsing the £75m Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January 2018.  BBCSports
