Stand-up comedian and social commentator, Francis Agoda, aka I Go Dye has praised Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa and the youths for the peace enjoyed in the state so far. The comedian who was speaking at the instance of the 28th aniversary of the creation of the state, urged all not to let the crisis that bedevilled the state in the past rear it’s ugly face again. He noted that militancy, ethnic crisis and kidnapping of expatriates were done of the things that once gave the state a setback.
According to him, “The journey towards the creation of Delta State began with a collective aspiration, which witnessed a bond of diversity, creating Delta State of Nigeria in love and brotherhood. Reflecting on this 28th anniversary, a lot has happened to us as a people. Today, I felicate with all Deltans, urging us to expand our collective goals towards greater capacity, sustaining peace and resourcefulness. In retrospect, we must continue to promote peace and live together as one, because the years of militancy, ethnic crisis and kidnapping of foreign expatriates led to the departure of many oil companies in Delta State, which created unemployment and loss of social support from the companies because their operational offices were relocated out of Niger Delta region.” He urged the authorities to open all seaports across the nation, continue to promote peace, as no community can thrive in rancour. While urging Okowa to expand on the state’s human resorce development, he noted that the latter’s administration has been a fertile ground for continuous development in the state.
