The election petition tribunal in Kano on Friday sacked Shamsuddeen Dambazau, the son of former Minister of Interior Abdulrahman Dambazau, as member representing Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency. The tribunal ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to issue certificate of return to Surajo Kanawa, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Dambazau, who did not contest the election but came second in the APC primaries, got the mandate when a Federal High Court in Kano disqualified a former presidential aide, Kawu Sumaila, in a pre-election suit. Dambazau had sued INEC, APC and Mr Sumaila challenging the nomination of the latter as the candidate of APC. He told the court through his counsel, Nuraini Jimoh, that Mr Sumaila contested for the Kano South senatorial seat and lost to Kabiru Gaya. Sumaila had indeed contested the Kano South senatorial ticket of the APC. He lost to a serving senator, Kabiru Gaya.
