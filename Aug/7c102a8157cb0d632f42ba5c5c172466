The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) plan to set up a 10-man working committee to assist in achieving the agency’s four cardinal points agenda. The agenda are: the harmonisation of tariff, enforcement and regulation of standards, unified waterways operations and creating an enabling environment for passengers and operators. LASWA General Manager Emmanuel Oluwadamilola, who spoke at the weekend in Lagos, said the agreement reached by the agencies would focus on enforcement of all waterways laws, adding that harmonisation and unification of operations is key to achieving safety. He noted that tariffs, fees and penalties would be streamlined through the harmonised system put in place, adding that all payment made by operators would be designated to a single purse. The LASWA boss stressed also that parties would share proceeds in furtherance of their respective agencies. He also disclosed that both agencies would also collaborate with the Nigerian Navy and Marine Police to ensure compliance by passengers and operators. “Our agreement reached is for us to set up a joint committee, which is going to ensure the implementation of these points highlighted. That joint committee is made of five people from NIWA and five people from LASWA and they are the people that will sit down and harmonise the whole process put together towards the implementation,” he said. He said the previous administration channelised four routes which are about 80 percent completed,  pointing out that the joint committee would emphasis on additional routes that would come on stream. “Now that we have joint resources, we will pull them together because channelisation is capital intensive; it runs into millions or billions of naira; and since Lagos was able to do at least four before, now that we have come together you will realise that we will be able to double the figure,” Oluwadamilola said.
