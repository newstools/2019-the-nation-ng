A man, Sylvester Sunday, who allegedly stole a television set and a stabilizer worth N82,000 from a shop on the pretext of buying items there, appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, at the weekend. Sunday, 21, who lives at Kayode Alabi Street, Ifako-Ijaiye, Ikeja, is facing a two-count charge of stealing and burglary. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Michael Unah said the defendant committed the offences at Haruna Street, off College Road in Ijaiye. He alleged that the defendant entered the shop of the complainant, Linus Nwaigwe, and stole a TV set and a stabilizer worth N82,000. Unah alleged that the defendant committed the offences when he went to the complaint’s shop to buy some items. “Nwaigwe said when the defendant gave him money, he discovered that he did not have change, so he decided to ask around. “By the time the complainant returned to his shop, he noticed that the defendant had carried away his television set and a stabiliser. “Nwaigwe said he immediately dashed out of his shop; he saw the defendant going away with the items he had stolen from his store,” the prosecutor said. He said the complainant raised the alarm, which led to the arrest of the defendant by some of the people in the area. He said the defendant was handed over to the police, who brought him to court after they had completed their investigations. He adjourned the case August 28.
