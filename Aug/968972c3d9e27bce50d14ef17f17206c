A labour expert, Ms Cynthia SamuelOlonjuwon, has said Africa’s large population should be a demographic dividend, if properly harnessed. According to her, underemployment, unemployment, informality and working poverty have remained persistent challenges on the continent. Ms. Samuel Olonjuwon, who is an International Labour Organisation (ILO) Assistant Director-General and Regional Director for Africa, said a staggering 95 per cent of young African workers were engaged in informal employment coupled with other challenges, while around 38 per cent others were  working poor. Speaking at a workshop in Abuja, Olonjuwon said while the region continues to witness frequent situations of disaster, conflict or fragility, the youths are the most vulnerable, noting that from 2000 to 2014, employment grew at an average annual rate of only 1.8 per cent. She said while the labour force grew at an annual rate of three per cent, almost twice as fast and if the trend continues, Africa will have an additional 100 million unemployed youth by 2030. To her, Africa must observe that  the youth crisis in Africa is an employment crisis that affects the whole economy and community and not just the youth.
