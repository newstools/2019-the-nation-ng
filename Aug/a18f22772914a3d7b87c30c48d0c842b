To ensure proper implementation and compliance with the recently-launched National valuations standards, also called Green Book, the Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria (ESVARBON) has rolled out a comprehensive capacity building programme for stakeholders, estate surveying and valuation practitioners. The two-day event, held in Lagos, received full complements of financial institutions, credit officers, regulatory agencies, valuation teachers and registered estate surveyors and valuers. Chairman of ESVARBON, Sir Nweke Umezurike said the training was geared towards bringing the relevant stakeholders on the imports of the valuation standards in their works. It is also aimed at making the stakeholders see the efforts of the board in improving the valuation practice.While urging the clients to reciprocate by paying what is fair to the practitioners, Umezurike wants the clients to patronise registered valuers rather than their friends and relatives in order to reduce the frequency of valuation reviews. He stressed that the key professional document was produced by ESVARBON last year in fulfillment of its obligations under the enabling Act to ensure greater transparency and responsibility in valuation practice in Nigeria.
