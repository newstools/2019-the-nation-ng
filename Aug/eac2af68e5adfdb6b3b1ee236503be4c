A final year student journalist of the Obafemi Awolowo University,  Ile Ife, Adejumo Kabir has unveiled a book on best practices of campus journalism. The book, titled “Campus Journalism Beginners Handbook” according to its author Mr Adejumo Kabir, is a guide that will help student journalists report their campuses better and prepare them for journalism after school. In the foreword of the book, the Executive Publisher of Premium Times, Dapo Olorunyomi, noted the author had done the broad practice of journalism in Nigeria a great service by putting together and publishing what, to his mind, is the first practice guide on the hitherto “hidden” genre of campus journalism.  Another top Media Career Specialist, Lekan Otufodunrin also wrote that the opportunities available for campus journalists of this generation are much and there is a need to ensure that those engaged in the art maximise their potentials. Kehinde Ayantunji, Chairman of Nigeria Union of Journalists in Osun, said the book is an intelligent investment and a huge consolation about the predicament of the Nigeria youths particularly the educated ones in tertiary institutions. Kabir is a freelance journalist for Premium Times with dozens of investigative journalism awards to his name at the national and international level. He was named finalist at the 2018 Africa Check Awards (Student category) in South Africa. Early this year, he launched the Campus Press Hub; an initiative offering training and consultancy services on best practices of campus journalism to students across Nigerian institutions. This book is the second handbook guide for campus journalists after a book titled: “The Road Before the Fourth Estate” co-authored by Kunle Adebajo and Kanyinsola Olorunnisola, who are now both graduates of University of Ibadan.
