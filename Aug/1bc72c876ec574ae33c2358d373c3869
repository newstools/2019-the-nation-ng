NIGERIA’S prospect of winning a medal in the Women’s 100m at the 12th Africa Games, was thwarted after two-time Commonwealth champion, Blessing Okagbare-Ighoteguonor was disqualified in the semi-final for a false start on Monday at the Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex, venue of the track and field event of the ongoing Africa Games in Rabat Morocco. NationSport reports that African Queen of the Tracks had given the country the hope after finishing with a time of 11.53s in the 1st round Heat 3 earlier in the day.
