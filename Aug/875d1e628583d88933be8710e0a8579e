The Esogban of Bénin Kingdom, Chief David Edebiri, has shared secret of why he looked healthy at 90 years. Chief Edebiri said understanding how the heart works and contentment has helped him to maintain a healthy life style. Edebiri spoke in Bénin City while addressing journalists on activities lined up to celebrate his 90th birthday scheduled to hold between August 30th and September 2nd, 2019. He said, “The most important thing is the heart. Look at your heart. If people understand how their heart behaves, they will not do bad things and you will sleep normally. “Don’t go and put your hands where it will not reach. You are not able to buy a bicycle but you want to ride Mercedes. How can you sleep well? Chief Edebiri however praised President Mohammadu Buhari for making his cabinet a mixture of old and young people. Edebiri noted that a cabinet filled with only young people would not achieve anything because ‘they will fight, beat themselves out and nothing will be done in the next four years. If they are all old people, they will be snoring while debates are going on.’ He stated that the problem in Nigeria is because opposition party does not praise the government even if when they do good. On the crisis in the Edo Assembly, he said, “Those quarrelling are my children. No good father sides some of his children to beat others. Those quarrelling are the supporters of the groups who continues to exchange bitter vexations, sentiments and rhetorics. “They are the people causing the trouble. The ones you think are quarrelling are my children. Edo Assembly crisis is a phase. It will soon pass off and peace will be restored. Those of us who want peace don’t talk publicly. Those people who talk were the same people who came to me to complain about the Governor here. They are now the same people saying they are going to die.”
