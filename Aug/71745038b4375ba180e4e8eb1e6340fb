The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, Comrade Abba Yaro, has unfolded plans to reposition the chapter for future elections. He said the party will take stock and rebuild to avoid the pitfalls of 2019 polls. Yaro said the re-building will involve aggressive membership drive, mass mobilisation of members and reconciliation. He described the APC as the best party for Benue. Yaro lamented that APC was rigged out of power, adding that the mandate will be retrieved at the tribunal. According to the APC chairman, the party has started mobilising members. He said: “We don’t have to wait until  2023 is around the corner  before mobilising our supporters ,we are doing that now “said Yaro. On the governorship case before the election  tribunal, the chairman said APC was waiting for  the outcome, which he said, will favor APC candidate, Emmanuel Jime.
