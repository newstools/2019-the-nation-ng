President Muhammadu Buhari must make a difference on the economy, which, according to the National Union of Shops and Distributive Employees (NUSDE), has been in coma for the past four years. NUSDE President Comrade Innocent Jaja told reporters that the task would not be impossible for him to achieve, if he could get technocrats to do the job rather than party members. He stated casualisation enslaved workers, and the union’s  position is that they must be liberated. Jaja listed the problems the union was facing in organising its members and the steps taken to resolve the issues. He said: “It is the issue of the economy. Last year you said the economy was in crisis and, right now, it is still in crisis. I mentioned then the issue of just one factor, which was power. I said then very fortunately that the then minister of power was the former Lagos State governor and he did say then that a serious government could fix the power problem within six months. “He was there for four years and the problem still persisted. Government should fix power, most of the companies in our sector use power 24 hours. One can imagine how much they have to spend buying diesel to run their organisations. If power is fixed, for instance, the money being used could be deployed for the expansion of the companies and these companies could employ more hands, which would help in reducing the unemployment problem in the country.’’
