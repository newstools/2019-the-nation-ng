Groups under the platform of Forum of Civil Society Organisations in Nigeria (FCSON) have backed the ambition of Engr. Keniebi Okoko to lead Bayelsa state. They believe Okoko has what it takes to lead Bayelsa into the team of developed states in the country. In a statement by the Coordinator of FCSON, Olasumbo Lawson, the groups stated that beyond the global paradigm shift of young people taking up the mantle of leadership at various positions, Okoko is adequately positioned and eminently qualified to consolidate on the work of Governor Seriake Dickson in the areas of job creation and youth empowerment. They called for the support of PDP delegates and people of the state towards ensuring Okoko’s emergence as next governor of the state. The statement reads: “We are of the strong view that the person of Engr.Keniebi Okoko is eminently qualified to lead Bayelsa from the shackles and manacles of stagnation into the cynosure of all eyes in the committee of States in the country. “The group hereby call on PDP delegates to the party guber primaries on September 3rd, to rightly vote and endorse the candidature of Keniebi Okoko. This shall be a preparatory endorsement toward his ultimate emergence as the next Executive Governor of the state in the November general election on the platform of PDP”. The statement went further.”
