Romelu Lukaku has completed an €80 million (£74m/$90m) move to Inter from Manchester United, putting an end to a summer saga that sees the striker join forces with long-time admirer Antonio Conte. Having fallen out of favour at Old Trafford under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Belgian is now set to spearhead a Nerazzurri side looking to unseat a Juventus outfit led by Cristiano Ronaldo as the champions of Serie A. Inter announced the deal by having Lukaku video himself in Milan, with the 26-year-old stating: “Inter is not for everyone. That’s why I’m here.” He is now only the fourth player to have been transferred for a fee of more than £50m ($61m) twice in his career. The club have announced that Lukaku has signed a contract until 2024. The 81-cap Belgium international spent two seasons in Manchester, scoring 28 goals in 66 appearances for the Red Devils. He was pushed out of the first team last season when Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho in the dugout, with the Norwegian preferring to play Marcus Rashford in the central role up front. It was understood over the summer that he was the top target for Conte ahead of his first season in Milan, but Juventus looked to have hijacked the deal. The Serie A champions were prepared to offer Paulo Dybala in a swap deal, but that move fell through, as United were unwilling to meet the Argentina international’s wage demands. There were also rumours Dybala was unconvinced by United and the collapse of that deal cleared the way for Inter and Conte to get their man. Lukaku was training with Anderlecht ahead of the new season as he agitated for a move away from England. There were reports that the relationship between Lukaku and Solskjaer had broken down, with the United boss apparently telling the striker he should expect to train with the Under-23s until his situation had been resolved. Lukaku is the second forward player to arrive at Inter this summer after Eddie Salcedo moved from Genoa.
