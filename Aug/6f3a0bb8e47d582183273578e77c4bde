A FORMER governor in one of the Northcentral states is passing through one of his worst moments since he left office on May 29. He is living in perpetual fear of arrest over some of his alleged shady deals in office for which he is being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Already, some of his political associates, including a former classmate of his, have reportedly been quizzed by the anti-graft agency over their involvement in the illegal acquisition of government-owned properties in the state as well as Abuja. Since he left office on May 29, he has kept stoically to himself, studiously avoiding public functions for fear that he could be embarrassed at such functions by EFCC officials or other security agencies. In the state that he governed for eight years he is a recluse. In Abuja which he visits clandestinely, he is in self-imposed confinement. Although he is said to have secured admission for a doctoral degree in a Canadian university, the former governor is said to have put the programme on hold because he fears that he could be arrested at the airport. Although he is yet to be invited by the EFCC for questioning, he is said to be aware of the numerous petitions against him over the manner he handled the finances of the state while he held sway as governor, and the fact that some of his associates involved in the deals are being quizzed has heightened his fear.
