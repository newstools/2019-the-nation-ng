The Federal Government and the Joint Public Service Negotiating Council are scheduled to meet on Friday to try and finalise negotiations on the consequential adjustment on the new minimum wage which has been stalled due to disagreement between the two parties. The Nation learnt from sources close to that team that a lot of progress has been made in the negotiations and that there are indications that an agreement might be reached after the meeting. Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige had told newsmen in Wednesday that he will immediately get down to business to ensure that the issues in contention are amicably resolved so that workers will begin to enjoy the new wages. While workers are demanding for 30 percent adjustment for workers on grade levels 07-14 and 25 percent for levels 15-17, the government is offering 9.5 and 5 percent respectively. A formal agreement on the consequential agreement is delaying the implementation of the new minimum wage signed into law on April 18 by the President.
