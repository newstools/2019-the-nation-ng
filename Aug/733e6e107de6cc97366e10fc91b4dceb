Phyno, KCEE and Onyeka Onwenu   performed excellently at the Hi-Life Fest finale last Sunday. The three months long festival, which featured a talent hunt and sensational music performances by groups and budding Hi-Life artistes across the Southeast, finally reached an epic on August 19, as winners emerged in the dance and music category. For the Hi-Life category, four finalists – Frank Onyeka, Chimaroke Chimex, Chijioke Charles, and Umunnukwe  Nwanja – brought their A-game as they attempted to stake their claim on the grand prize of N5 million. It was a stunning showpiece as each of the finalists thrilled the audience. At the end of the performances, Charles was named winner of the grand prize in that category. In the troupe category, the Ofu Obi Dance Troupe from Enugu State went home with N2 million, the star prize. Aside the Hi-Life artistes, previous winners of the fest, like Chibest David and Dons Ifeanyi, took to the stage to thrill guests. There were guest performances also. KCEE, a hip-hop artiste, kicked off the performances. The  singer showed why he is a favourite of fans in the East, with some impeccable stagecraft and impressive dance steps. After KCEE came veteran singer Onyeka Onwenu, who  proved her legendary status with a performance which was full of zest. It was a sight to behold. Wrapping up the night was Phyno, the multi-talented rapper with a track of all his chart-topping singles and show-stopping moves. Bright Chimezie, a Hi-Life  legend, crowned the new Hi-Life king Chaarles, bringing the fest to an end.
