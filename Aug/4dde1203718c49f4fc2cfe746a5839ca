There are indications that the founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo may be granted bail. Mrs. Busola Dakolo had alleged that the pastor raped her as a 16-year-old 20 years ago while in Ilorin, capital of Kwara State. Though the pastor denied the allegation, detectives at the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID) in Abuja on Tuesday invited him for interrogation. A source at the FCIID who spoke to The Nation around 4:30pm on the fate of Fatoyinbo, said: “Presently, he is still with us. “We cannot conclude yet if he will be detained or not but from what I have observed, he is likely to be granted bail.” The Force spokesman, Frank Mba also confirmed that the pastor was being interrogated. He said: “Yes, he is currently at FCIID undergoing interrogation. We have been conducting discreet investigation. We are making efforts to reach one or two other pastors she alleged intervened then. “It was a deliberate investigative strategy to bring Fatoyinbo much later after we must have gotten other things. “Some Nigerians were thinking we did not want to talk to him but that is not so. “He is with us now and I cannot say if he will be detained nor not. Investigators will have to determine that. “They might choose to detain him or grant him bail while investigation continues. “We have the statement of Busola Dakolo already. She earlier made a statement to the police. Nigerians are assured that we will diligently investigate and conclude this case.”
