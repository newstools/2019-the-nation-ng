The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has promised to provide adequate funding to the Federal Fire Service (FFS). Aregbesola said this during a familiarisation visit to the FFS on Friday in Abuja. He said that he had been briefed on some of the challenges faced by the agency and was ready to eradicate those shortcomings. “I am aware releases are not adequate and you already have some committed expenditure you cannot fund,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that FFS had seek special intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari for funds of the sum of N9.20 billion to ensure the delivery of the remaining 32 firefighting equipment. Aregbesola promised to attend to the immediate needs of the service by providing adequate support to the agency’s growth. “We will ensure we get you to the operations of the best fire service in the world,” he said. He however reiterated that the agency’s role of ensuring the safety of lives and properties was of paramount importance. The minister said that it was important to enforce preventive strategies by being proactive. Mr Liman Ibrahim, Controller General (CG), FFS, said that he was grateful the Minister had promised to tackle the challenges faced by the service. Ibrahim said that the agency has 32 already manufactured fire fighting trucks in Austria and Turkey but were yet to be delivered by the contractor due to inadequate funds. He said that the earlier 12 newly acquired fire fighting trucks had not been delivered because operators and drivers of the vehicles were undergoing training. “By Sunday, 25th August, 2019, these vehicles will be moved to various zones across the country,” he said. NAN reports that 2 vehicles will be allocated each to the newly established 6 zonal fire service stations: Minna, Sokoto, Yola, Owerri, Asaba and Osogbo. (NAN)
