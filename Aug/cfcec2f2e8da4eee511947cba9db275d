The National and State Assembly Election Petitions tribunal sitting in Benin City has reserve ruling in the petitions filed by Barr. Omosede Igbinedion of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Patrick Idiake of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Barr. Igbinedion is challenging the election of Hon Dennis Idahosa who won the Ovia Federal Constituency seat while Idiake is challenging the election of Joe Edionwele. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice O. Ogundana, said ruling would be delivered on both petitions on a day to be communicated to all parties through hearing notices. Speaking on Friday during adoption of written of addresses, Counsel to Edionwele, Kingsley Obamogie, urged the tribunal to enter judgement in favour of his client and dismissed the petition. Further attempts by Obamogie to speak on his written address were rejected by Counsel to Idiake, Ken Mozia. Obamogie told the tribunal that reliefs demonstrated in open court are not forgotten but Mozia interjected saying, “Adopt and leave at that. Unless you want to bring in something else. Why is insisting if what he wants to say is in his address.” Counsel to the PDP, Sunday Aguinede, urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition as totally lacking in merit and substance. Mozia on his part said the petitioners have duly established entitlements to the reliefs they sought. In the petition filed by Omosede, Counsel to Idahosa and the APC, Robert Emukperuo and C.I Aiguobarueghian respectively urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition for lacking in merit. Counsel to Igbinedion, Ferdinand Orbih, urged the tribunal to uphold the petitioners’ case.
