The new Olowo of Owo in Ondo state, Prince Gbadegesin Ogunoye, was on Friday installed as the 33rd Owo monarch. The traditional rites started very early and were witnessed by residents of the town and other guests. Speaking to reporters, the Ojumu of Owo, Chief Olanrewaju Famakinwa, said that the rites became necessary as being laid down by customs and culture of the ancient town. Famakinwa said that the monarch chose sword of peace in the course of the rite. He said: “Oba Ogunoye who is being installed today chose a sword which signifies peace. “Traditionally, before Olowo is installed, he will have to choose a sword at Oke Mapo and it is believed that whatever one he chooses will tell how his reign will be. “Coincidentally, he chose the same sword chosen by his father more than 30 years ago and the sword represents sword.” Also, the Agbaomolowo of Owo, Chief Idowu Oludaye, said the day was a good one for the ancient town because there was a new monarch. He described the new Olowo as a man of honour, patience and humility, hoping his reign would bring peace, prosperity and development to the town. Oludaye urged Oba Ogunoye to accommodate all and sundry, advising the residents of the town to support him. He said there will be coronation of the new Olowo in the next 17 days. Also the Adanigbo Onula, Chief Kunle Ijalana, said the day was spectacular because it was another success recorded in the town. Ijalana prayed that the new monarch would reign longer than those before him. Oba Ogunoye was selected as Olowo after getting 14 votes out of 15 on July 12 after demise of late Oba Victor Olateru- Olagbegi who died on April 18, 2019, aged 77. The legal practitioner voluntarily resigned as Permanent Secretary in the state civil service on Thursday to ascend the throne of his ancestors.
