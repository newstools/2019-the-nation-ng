THERE is no doubt that Olufunke Oshonaike and Segun Toriola are aiming for another record at the 2019 African Games in Morocco. The veterans began their journey at the games at Cairo 1991 and in 2019, they are still an integral part of Team Nigeria with the hope of setting new African records. Already, Toriola has become the first African athlete to feature in seven Olympic Games and he is aiming to shift the goal post by making his eighth appearance at Tokyo 2020 in Japan. For Oshonaike, she is also aiming to become the first female athlete in Africa to feature in seven Olympic Games having competed in six since she made her debut at Atlanta 1996. The players who are both in their late 40s, have featured in African Games since 1991 and they are regarded as some of the most successful athletes at the games. Posting the picture she took with Toriola in 1991 besides the recent one they took during the opening ceremony of the 2019 edition on Monday, August 19, Oshonaike wrote on her Facebook page: “Funke Oshonaike and Segun Toriola at All African games Cairo 91, and now at Rabat 2019. 8 times!!! To God be the glory of our life. I think we deserve some accolades and national honour. We have won so many medals for our dear country Nigeria through it all. We will still win medals for our country again this time around by God grace. Pray for us. #thankGod, #talented #wearespecial #nonstoppingus #fromgrasstograce.” Toriola is Nigeria’s captain to the games and the flagbearer during the opening ceremony, while Oshonaike was also the country’s flagbearer to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil.
