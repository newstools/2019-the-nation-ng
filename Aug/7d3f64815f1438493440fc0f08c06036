The police on Thursday arraigned a 40-year-old lawyer, Emmanuel Adebayo, at an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court, Lagos for allegedly defrauding a woman of N500,000. Adebayo is charged alongside Emmanuel Okah, 39 and Bode Olaogun, 29, with four counts of charge of conspiracy, obtaining by false pretences, stealing and forgery. Prosecuting Inspector Donjour Perezi said the defendants committed the offence on May 13 at Alapere, Lagos. Perezi alleged that Adebayo collected N500, 000 from the complainant, Mrs. Christy Effiong, to procure a survey plan for her,  a representation he knew was false. He alleged that Adebayo gave Olaogun N120, 000 to prepare a fake plan. The prosecutor also alleged that Adebayo gave N200, 000 to Okah to prepare a 2017 Red Copy of the Survey Plan. Perezi alleged that Adebayo gave the complainant a forged approved survey plan after seeking his services from the Surveyor General’s Office. “The complainant took the survey plan to the Surveyor General’s Office only to discover that it was fake,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate Bukola Mogaji admitted the defendants to N100,000 bail each with two sureties each in the like sum. She said Adebayo must submit his Call to the Bar certificate to the registrar. The case continues on September 25.
