Most bus drivers and conductors could be bold and rude towards passengers over issues that could be avoided if managed well. Sometimes issues are escalated and both parties’ haul insults on themselves, which leads to chaos. Below are ways to avoid arguments with bus conductors: Always remember to tell them where you are going before boarding a bus to be sure they are driving through your route. Bus drivers sometimes try to truncate routes to avoid traffic. Also, always try to remind them of where you are alighting because they most times don’t care and end up missing stops therefore. You have to tell them where you are going to avoid argument with them and to save yourself the stress of either trekking to your suppose bus stop or paying another fare to get there. *Have exact fare amount before boarding a bus. Most of these conductors could be cunning and sometimes you might end up leaving your change with them because you are in a hurry to meet up with work. When you don’t have change, make sure the amount you are giving the conductor is not so high from the normal price to avoid trouble and insults from him and passengers. Sometimes passengers are at fault because these conductors make their own announcement ( abeg enter with your change o) but we still do not comply leading to embarrassment and definitely Nigerian conductors and drivers are no respecter of anyone. Know how to talk : Few passengers prefer to be gentle while these conductors grossly abuse them. This is not to say they are weak or can’t fight for themselves. But some passengers would act like the conductors, exchanging words thereby causing so much chaos among passengers. Negotiate fare before boarding: Yes! It’s possible for you not to have enough but it’s also right to tell the conductor or driver what you have at hand if they accept you can board the bus but if they don’t there is no need boarding in order to avoid embarrassment you can try another bus.
