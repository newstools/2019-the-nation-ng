The Managing Director, Life Above Poverty Organisation, LAPO, Micro Finance Bank, Godwin Ehigiamusoe has said that the bank hopes to give N154billion loans to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises before the year ends as against the N137 billion disbursed to them in 2018. He spoke during the company’s 8th Annual General Meeting held in Lagos last Thursday. “There is a huge gap between the demand for finance for credit by owners of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises so as a microfinance bank, committed to supporting that end, our major operation is supporting credit. We prioritise giving loan to those businesses. This has been our commitment right from when we were a non-profit organisation,” he said. Speaking on the state of the business environment in Nigeria, he said the business environment has been quite challenging for all businesses not just LAPO but despite that, “we did our best to deliver our usual superior financial performance and it is for that reason that we were able to provide the announced dividend for investor but what is important is that the bigger chunk of our profit after tax has actually been put back into the business.”
