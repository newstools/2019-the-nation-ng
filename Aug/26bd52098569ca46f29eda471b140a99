Coach of the Nigeria U19 boys’ team, Emeka Nnamani has said that the team must beat host North Macedonia today if they hope to progress at IHF Youth World Championship Skopje, North Macedonia. The Nigerian team lost to Bahrain 36-28 in their debut on Tuesday and will be hoping for victory against the host, who also lost their opening game to Argentina 26-23. Nnamani said that his team needs the win to stay in contention after Tuesday’s loss to Bahrain. “Well, we should expect a win and nothing less. Though the standard of competition is high and technical, we are ready to give a good account of ourselves.” The coach stated that the hosts are a strong side and one of the best handball-playing countries in the world, while urging his team to give their best in today’s game. “Macedonia is one of the best handball Nations in the world. And as the host country, they had a good preparation for the championship. However, I believe we will come out victorious in today’s game.” He also said that the team has corrected its mistake during yesterday’s training, expressing the belief that the players would be tactically disciplined to adhere to the game plan. He also noted that the standard of the competition is high and assured that his boys would give their best at the championship. The host was under pressure against Argentina, missing glaring chances toward the end of the games but would hope for calm nerves when they meet Nigeria today.
