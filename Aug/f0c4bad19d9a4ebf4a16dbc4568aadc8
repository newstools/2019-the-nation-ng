Akanni, the prosecutor claimed, collected N430,000 from Mrs. Dolapo Tunner and N125,000 from Mr. Odulanmi Murtala, who he promised to secure jobs for. “My lord, the defendant also claimed to be a lawyer; he told everyone that he had won the election. “He also collected some money from members of his church with this scam. “He went as far as taking people to Abuja under the guise of going for his inauguration. “He forged INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu’s signature and the INEC seal on the certificate of return,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate S. O. Obasa granted the defendant N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She ordered that the sureties must be above 40 and live within the court’s jurisdiction. Obasa said the sureties must show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She ruled that one of the sureties must be the defendant’s relation.
