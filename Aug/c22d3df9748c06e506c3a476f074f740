Joseph Abdallah known as Joe and Ede Nkechinyere known as  Enkay have been evicted from the 2019 Big Brother Naija. Both housemates were among those recently brought into the #PepperDem house by Big brother. During his time in the house, Joe was issued a strike by Big brother for engaging in a heated argument with fellow housemate Tacha. He was said to have provoked his fellow housemate into hitting him with her hands. Enkay is widely remembered for her refusal to play the ludo game with Cindy, her fellow housemate. Speaking with Ebuka on stage, Enkay said “I love Cindy. It had nothing to do with the ludo game” The game continues with sixteen housemates running for 60 million naira.
