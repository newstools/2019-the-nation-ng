The Federal Government Saturday said it would build affordable houses for low and middle-income earners across the country. The government said its target was cut the 20 million housing deficit in the country by 2033. To do that, the government said it would build one million housing units annually. Minister of State, Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu, stated these when he visited the Federal Government Housing Estate, Zuba, Abuja, on Saturday to inspect the level of work done on the project. He said: “By the time we are able to provide the enabling environment and remove all these problems and create a level playing ground for investors to come in I think we will be able to reach our target at 2033 where we will close the gap of over 20 million (housing) deficit. “Now the production is very low, around 100, 000 houses per year in the formal sector. “We hope to improve it to one million houses per year so as to close the gap of 17-20 million housing deficit by 2033. That is the target of the government. “We are on board and committed to doing that (closing the housing deficit gap). He said the government would ensure the speedy competition of the project. According to him, the project is already at 75 percent and would be delivered to Nigerians soon. The minister said the government would extend the housing project to other states. “This project was approved in 2017. This is the pilot and we hope to replicate them in other states. “We already have the project in two sites here in Abuja. We will look at ways to replicate them in other states. “As you know, we have a huge deficit of housing, mostly middle and low income. “We will complete this project as one of primary objectives. “The project is already at 75 percent, we will make sure there is no delay by ensuring its speedy completion,” he added.
