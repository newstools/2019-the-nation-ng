As Nigeria joins other world nations to celebrate this year’s International Youth Day, a non-governmental organisation, Development Communications (Devcoms) Network, has enjoined states and federal governments to declare state of emergency in the education sector. Speaking in Lagos, the Programme Director of Devcoms Network, Akin Jimoh, said, to address the present turmoil and gap in educational development among Nigerian youths, governments as well as parents and guardians, should take education as a paramount goal and a basic necessity of life. Jimoh opined that state of emergency in education will save and guarantee the future of Nigeria. He noted that education is the best gift to bequeath to children as it would give them tools to help provide for themselves in the future with positive impact on key development parameters such that the rate of poverty, early girl-child pregnancies and other social vices will be reduced among a large number of Nigerian youths. Commenting on this year theme, ‘Transforming Education’, Jimoh said it is pertinent to ensure inclusive and equitable quality of education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all as enshrined in Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs.
