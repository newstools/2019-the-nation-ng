Ohaneze Ndigbo youths wing has joined the call for immediate release of the convener of the #RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore. It condemned the federal government for disrupting the protest, saying it was not intended to upset its agenda. In a statement on Thursday by the national leader of the group, Amb. Dr. Arthur Uchenna Obiorah, the body said Sowore’s detention fell below international standard. It asked the leaders to read between the lines to discover the protesters’ demand in the general interest of the country. The statement partly reads: “We refute the claims that the group’s intention was to upset the government agenda. “The authority should read between the lines and decode the true messages behind the nationwide agitations. “We request an unconditional release of the Presidential candidate of the Africa Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore whose detention by the men of the Department of Secret Service DSS, has fallen below international standard that allows freedom of association, expression and assemblage of men of like minds. “The nation is in dire need of national conference where most of the questions itemized by Sowore are considered for implementation. “The clamour for #RevolutionNow by Nigerians should be well thought about. “It is an avenue where Nigerians explore to pour out their minds on the state of the nation in protest of what they feel is not right within the context of the universal coverage.” The youths leader further called on President Buhari to reconsider the earlier request by the Southern and Middle belt leaders on restructuring of the country that would devolve powers to the federating units.
