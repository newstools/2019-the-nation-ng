Lagos State Lotteries Board (LSLB) has warned licensed operators not to allow minors take bet at their outlets. Speaking on Wednesday at a news briefing in Ikeja, General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer Seun Anibaba said operators who failed to heed the warning of “Game Responsibly” would be fined, suspended and they might lose their licences. He said bet advertisements should not be placed near schools, adding that advertisements on television, which attracted children under 18 years, would be sanctioned. Anibaba appealed to parents to sensitise and warn their children, who are minors, not get close to any betting centre. He said the LSLB enforcement unit would monitor bet centres, adding that any minor caught would face the consequences.
