The hope of Nigerian goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi reclaiming his number one jersey at Premier Soccer League (PSL) side Kaizer Chiefs, is getting slimmer after he was benched on the opening day of the season. Kaizer Chiefs secured an impressive 3-2 away win over Highland Park at the Makhulong Stadium yesterday with young South African shot-stopper preferred ahead of the Super Eagles’ first choice goalkeeper at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Eric Mathoho scored the winner for Kaizer Chiefs in what was a ding-dong affair in their opening game of the new PSL season; as Amakhosi defeated Highland Park 3-2 on the road. Bvuma who has been in goal in the absence of first choice goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune, was between the sticks in the 2-0 Cup friendly defeat to Orlando Pirates last weekend. On Sunday, the 24-year-old goalie conceded two goals, but he wasn’t let down by his teammates, who put three past the opponent’s goal tender and secured a winning start to the new season. Akpeyi’s Chiefs future had been in doubt before the new season as the club had to make a decision on the foreign players-quota in the squad.
