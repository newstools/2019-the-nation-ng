Incidentally, in the 2015 edition, it was Cameroon that stopped the progression of D’Tigress in the semi-finals with a 71-70 narrow victory. Meanwhile, D’Tigress having announced their intention to defend their 2017 title by thrashing Tunisia 75-26 in the opening game have now qualified for the quarter-finals with the two victories. The game saw a top performance from D’Tigress’ Promise Amukamara who controlled the floor and aced 14 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. Although Cameroonian’s forward Amina Njoukou recorded 16 points, eight rebounds and one assist and two steals were not enough to get her team level. A collective hard work by Nigeria saw Aisha Mohammed Balarabe, Promise Amukamara, Adora Elonu and Ify Ibekwe ace 14 points individually to seal a big win for the team. D’Tigress would now wait for the clash between Cape Verde and Democratic Republic of Congo to determine their next opponent in the quarter-finals. (NAN)
