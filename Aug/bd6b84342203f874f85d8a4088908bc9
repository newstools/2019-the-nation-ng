Ondo State government and Peace Mass Transit Ltd have entered a partnership with the inauguration of Ondo Sunshine Travels. Chief Samuel Onyishi, who nurtured Peace Mass Transit from a lowly two-bus start-up in 1995 to a multi billion naira conglomerate, said private-public partnership wasn’t exactly an unknown business model but the PMT-Ondo Sunshine was the first of its kind involving a state government and a private entrepreneur. He added: “In the end, the people, the masses of Ondo and Nigeria at large, are the ultimate beneficiaries of this marriage. I’m not one to back away from trying a new business idea except it doesn’t make good sense at all or tends to have oppressive tendencies.” Admitting that most businesses would thrive better on monopoly, the businessman labelled it as anti-people. He noted: “I will not let the opportunity to serve the people on a new platform pass me by. It might have required a bit of bending over backwards and clearly meant venturing into new, uncharted territory, but I never fear to dare.” Onyishi stated that the disposition and personality of the Governor of Ondo State, Barrister Oluwarotimi Akerelolu, were helpful. He said: “The governor too had clear ideas on how to render populist services, apparently drawing from his massive professional exposure as a human right lawyer and activist before venturing into partisan politics. “Ondo Sunshine Travels is conceived to provide jobs for indigenes of the state and create transport entrepreneurs through the Driver-To-Owner scheme pioneered by PMT.” Onyishi also pledged at the inauguration to spare no resources to ensure the Ondo Sunshine Travels delivered on its mandate to Ondo people and Nigerians.
