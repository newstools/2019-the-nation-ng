Immediate past Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige and President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Comrade Ayuba Wabba met for the first time on Thursday after their open disagreement over inauguration of the Board of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). Ngige and Wabba, who attended the opening ceremony of the Global Youth Employment Forum in Abuja, however joked over their disagreement while exchanging pleasantries. Wabba had gone to say hello to the Minister and congratulated him on his reappointment when Ngige jokingly told him “you knew I was coming and you ran away”. The two of them have not meet since inauguration of the NSITF board over which they disagreed on the suitability of veteran labour leader, Frank Kokori to head the Board. Organised Labour also picketed the private residence of Senator Ngige in the Asokoro area of Abuja, leading to an attack on workers by thugs invited by unknown persons. As a result of the attack, Wabba who is also the President of the International Trade Union Confederation, asked workers across the world to embarrass him anywhere he is seen in the globe.
