Nigerian authorities have been asked to remember that the parents of the 112 Chibok girls yet to be recovered from the Boko Haram insurgents still live in anguish and high expectation of the return of the girls. A network of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) which gave the reminder in Yola, Adamawa State, made the point that the deprived parents need not only the efforts at getting their daughters back but also a life that is at least above extreme poverty so that they could live in modest comfort as they await the possible liberation of their children. The NGOs, Northeast Humanitarian Innovation Hub (NEHIH) and the VR360 Stories, made the points at a press briefing which included the screening of a virtual reality documentary on the Chibok girls, in which a particular mother is shown keeping all the personal effects of her missing daughter, including clothes which she washes frequently, in readiness for the return of her daughter. “These parents need to be empowered so that they don’t continue to wait in poverty, more so as they have children, other than those who are yet to be reclaimed, to take care of,” the Chief Executive Officer of VR360 Stories, Joel Benson, said. Joel Benson is the ‘story teller’ and creative brain behind ‘Daughters of Chibok,’ a film which highlights the impact of the kidnapped Chibok girls on the affected families and which was screened at the press briefing. It is a virtual reality documentary which transported viewers from the Yola viewing venue to Chibok where they observed among the people a mixture of sense of loss, pain, courage and hope. The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NEHIH, Ahmad Modibbo, who also spoke during the event which took place at the Legon Villa headquarters of NEHIH in Jimeta, Yola, said that beyond the anguish of 112 daughters that remained unaccounted for, the people of Chibok and the rest of the Northeast suffer peculiar deprivations forced by the Boko Haram insurgents which need to be mitigated. Modibbo said, “The Northeast region has been severely affected by the conflict, which exacerbated the preexisting socioeconomic developmental challenges in the region, hence making it have the lowest indices relative to the rest of the country in areas of healthcare, education, employment, infrastructure, among others.”
