Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has unveiled plan to convert the four Independent Campaign Groups (ICG) offices to consultative offices as a way of getting his government and policies closer to the people in the three senatorial districts. This, he added, will enable citizens to submit any of their policy input and demands that would help in achieving the developmental agenda of his administration. Sanwo-Olu’s Senior Special Assistant on Political Matters, Mr. Peter Ajayi, who went to inspect the various offices in the state over the weekend, made this known. Ajayi stated that the essence of the visitation was to assess the state of things in the campaign offices, saying that the governor is keen in making his policies to have people’s input. He added that the decision to turn the campaign offices to consultative centres was to galvanise input from the general public into the policy process of his government. “These centres will serve as offices where Lagosians can come to submit letters of policy demand and also meet to deliberate issues of public importance. In this wise, the citizens would have a sense of belonging in the government and also get to know what the government is really doing in ensuring the greatest happiness in the greatest number of people”, said Ajayi He added that the offices would as well complement the efforts of local government chairmen in the area of grassroots relations and management, saying that governance is all about the people and the promotion of their welfare. “The purpose of this visitation is to see and get first-hand information on what is needed to renovate and the necessary things to be done to ensure that the consultative centres are conducive for operation. We shall provide security, employ cleaners, administrative assistants and secretaries in all the 4 centres,” said Ajayi
