TraderMoni has been lauded for its impact on the citizens, especially, the poor people in both the rural and urban areas. The TraderMoni initiative is a key element in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration’s Social Investment Programmes. Its predecessors are MarketMoni and FarmerMoni. They fall under Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) under the Office of Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, according to a statement. Speaking at the inaugural TraderMoni town hall meeting in Taurani Market, GEEP Chief Operating Officer, Uzoma Nwagba,  said the town hall meetings would provide an avenue for the beneficiaries to engage directly with the different stakeholders such as officials from the implementation partner, Bank of Industry (BoI); financial institutions and partner organisations from the private sector. According to him, beneficiaries will also benefit from business advisory services to guide them in the utilisation of the funds for their businesses. He said the process of receiving cash out of the TraderMoni loans have been simplified and more transparent through the printing of lists of approved applicants which is vetted by the market leaders. Also speaking, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Social Investment Programmes, Barr Ahmed Isma’eel said the market leaders have been empowered to take ownership of the programme and ensure that the process runs smoothly.
