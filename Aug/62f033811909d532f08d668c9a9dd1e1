The lawmaker representing Ovia Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Dennis Idahosa, has commended Alhaji Aliko Dangote, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors forum, as well as the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, for ensuring peaceful resolution of the rift between Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki. Hon. Idahosa said the reported acrimony between the two leaders of the Edo APC was disturbing among their supporters. Idahosa who stated this in a press statement made available to journalists in Benin City said the feud resorted to verbal insults between their supporters and the ordinary citizens. He noted that the Salah visit by Governor Obaseki and his team to Oshiomhole residence at Iyamho was finally bearing dividend. The lawmaker called on the peace makers not to relent on their efforts, but to ensure that the move by both the governor and his predecessor at resolving the issues between them is permanent. According to him, “I am very optimistic that efforts of these notable personalities and group to ensure peace reigns between these two notable individuals have come to stay. “I must commend their efforts because, they have tried their best at restoring peace between this our leaders. Dangote, not been from Edo State, have seen the need to ensure peace between his friends. The APC governors’ forum also saw the need to resolve the lingering crisis by using the internal mechanism of the forum to address the matter,” he stated. “Ultimately, the direct beneficiary of this will be the ordinary citizens of the state. This account for why majority of the people have been disturbed with the fight.”
