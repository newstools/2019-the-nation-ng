The Chairman, All Progressives Congress based in Germany, Hon. Olalekan Ogunwede has condemned the assault on the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu. In a statement made available to the Nation, he said; “the coordinated assault on Sen. Ike Ekweremadu, which some members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in Nuremberg, Germany claimed responsibility for, is condemnable.” He said; “as it is the fundamental human rights of any group or individuals as Nigerian to express their opinions and demand their rights from every elected leader, it is also important that we conduct our acts in a very civil manner even in the light of untenable stewardship.” He enjoined any aggrieved groups or individuals to channel their grievances through legitimate diplomacy, civil protest and politicking rather than otherwise. He further implored restrain to be observed and that through dissenting and active engagement with the necessary sector of government, more can be achieved through instrument of diplomacy than violence.
