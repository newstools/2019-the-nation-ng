Oil workers yesterday threatened to take action over a staffing dispute with Chevron. The major oil workers, acting under the aegis of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), said they were prepared to take an industrial action if United States (U.S.) oil giant Chevron did not comply with their wishes within seven days over a reduction of the company’s workforce. A Chevron spokesman said he was unable to provide immediate comment on the development.
