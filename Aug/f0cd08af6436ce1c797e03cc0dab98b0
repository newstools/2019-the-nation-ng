Barcelona and Zenit Saint Petersburg have reached an agreement for the transfer of Malcolm. The Russian team will pay 40 million euros plus 5million euro in variables. Barca will also get a percentage of his fee if he is sold in the future. The Brazilian only managed to play 24 games and scored four times in the 2018/2019 season. The Catalan giants hijacked his move to Roma at the last minute last season, only for him to see limited actions. In an official message announcing his departure, Barcelona said: ‘Thank you and good luck.”
