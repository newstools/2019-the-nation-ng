Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the banned Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) and his wife, Zeenat have been spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The duo would leave the country on Monday for India, where they would receive medical attention for an undisclosed health challenge. They were arrested in December 2015 and have remained in DSS detention since, amidst reports of deteriorating health. It would be recalled that a High Court in Kaduna granted the detained couple bail on Monday to enable them embark on the medical trip. Meanwhile, one hundred and eighty six doctors from Pakistan, India, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq have written a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari concerning Sheikh El-Zakzakyâ€™s physical conditions. The letter published on Monday by Fars News, an Iranian news agency quoted the doctors as asking the Nigerian government to transfer him to a well-equipped hospital as soon as possible. It was however, not indicated whether the letter was written after a Kaduna High Court last week approved leave for El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat, to seek medical attention in India.
