 Liverpool ace Taiwo Awoniyi watched from the bench as Mainz05 were taken to the cleaners by Bayern Munich in the Germany Bundesliga on Saturday. Awoniyi who was listed but not fielded in the match it will be recalled enjoyed about 25 minutes action in the home tie against Borussia Mgladbach which ended 3-1 in favour of the visitors last week but was not in action against rampaging Bayern Munich on Saturday. Mainz had shot into the lead in the 6th minute thanks to Jean-Paul Boëtius to the surprise of the home fans at the Allianz arena but it took Bayern 30 minutes to equalize through Benjamin Pavard and from then on it was goals galore for the Niko Kovač tutored side. Nigeria born Austria international David Alaba and Robert Lewandowski were all on target. Mainz05 have thus conceded 9 goals in two matches scoring two. Mainz will next host Hertha BSC next week and will be hoping to return to winning ways and offer their fans opportunity to smile again. Awoniyi who was left out in Gernot Rohr’s squad to the last Nations cup is among the players lined up for September 10 international friendly against Ukraine in Kyiv. In the English Premier League it was all smiles for super Eagles midfielder Wilfred Ndidi as Leicester City beat visiting Bournemouth 3-1 at the King Power Stadium. The Nigerian international as usual was in action for the entire duration of the match with compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho not listed.
