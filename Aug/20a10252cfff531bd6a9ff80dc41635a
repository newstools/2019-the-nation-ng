Ekiti State Government on Thursday shut down four hospitals in the state over alleged non-compliance with ethics of medical practice. The affected hospitals were Adedamola, Omole hospitals and other two hospitals in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. Ilawe Ekiti were accused of being run by uncertified medical doctors. Ekiti State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, lamented how patients could be treated under unhygienic health facilities. Yahaya-Kolade said the exercise would be carried on a continuous basis with the aim of  stamping out quackery in the state. This, she, said would prevent residents of the state from avoidable deaths and unnecessary health issues. The Commissioner represented by the Director, Hospital Services and Training, Dr Rufus Adetoye, spoke during the unscheduled visit of the Medical Anti-quackery Committee set up by the Ekiti State Government to some hospitals in Ado Ekiti and Ilawe Ekiti. She disclosed that the Dr Kayode Fayemi administration had zero-tolerance for quackery in medical practice, saying the state government set up the committee to stamp out quackery in the state and to eradicate quackery in our dear state and the way innocent people are being killed must stop. Yahaya-Kolade said: “Unqualified doctors were met at some hospitals visited and this warranted sealing up the facilities.” “We are using this medium to enlighten the public that you are endangering your life if you visit or patronize any of the sealed hospitals which are not manned by qualified doctors. You should rather visit government hospitals for quality health care,” she added.
