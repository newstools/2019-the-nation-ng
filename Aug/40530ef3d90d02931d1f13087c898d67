Former Uruguay striker Diego Forlan has announced his retirement, bringing to an end a 21-year career in which he played club football on three different continents.
Forlan had started his career in South America with Argentine club Independiente. He went on to play for major European teams such as Manchester United, Villarreal, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan before ending his career in Asia. The 40-year-old Forlan was instrumental in Uruguay’s run to the 2010 FIFA World Cup semi-finals. There, he was awarded the Golden Ball for being the best player at the tournament and also finished as one of the tournament’s top scorers with five goals. “After 21 years I made the decision to end my career as a professional footballer. “A beautiful stage closes, full of great memories and emotions, but another of new challenges will begin. Thanks to all who in one way or another accompanied me on this path,” Forlan said in a statement. Forlan won the Premier League and FA Cup with Manchester United before moving to Spain. There he helped Atletico Madrid win the Europa League in 2010 with a double in the final against Fulham. He also led Uruguay to the Copa America title in 2011, grabbing another two goals in the final, when they beat Paraguay 3-0. Forman had a short stint in Indian Super League with Mumbai City in 2016. He played for Hong Kong Premier League side Kitchee Sports Club last year, wrapping up a career where he scored over 250 goals for club and country. (Reuters/NAN)
