The United Kingdom (UK) chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has disclaimed a factional group led by Ade Omole. The party said: “He does not represent APC UK as a leader, chieftain or whatsoever title he wishes to appropriate to himself.” In a statement yesterday, Dr. Philip Idaewor said the party’s UK chapter, which was approved by the National Executive Council (NEC) under his leadership, had put out series of public statements in the past. Idaewor claimed that he advised the party’s leadership as regards taking steps to verify the authenticity of persons coming from the UK who lay claims to representing the party. He regretted that despite these actions and previous statements from the chapter, the individuals have continued their activities of misrepresenting the chapter with actions that tend to portray the party to the public in bad light as existing in factions. He said: “The fact of the matter is that there are no factions of the party in the UK, but a group of individuals who are simply determined to not obey the rules set by the party. “The UK chapter of APC has a clear structure that recognises branches across the UK as well as Nigerian geopolitical caucuses. “APC UK chapter exists as a chapter of the party recognised by the NEC of our party, having satisfied the requirements set by the party’s leadership. Our chapter is one of the 12 approved Diaspora chapters of the party.” Idaewor urged the party leadership to call to order all those in the Diaspora who think, behave and act bigger than the party. He also appealed to the party leadership under Adams Oshiomhole to use his good office to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to restore confidence in the Diaspora chapters.
