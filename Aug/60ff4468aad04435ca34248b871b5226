Delta Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has assured that the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, will provide the best venue for the 2020 U-20 Women World Cup tournament to be hosted in Nigeria. Okowa gave the assurance on Wednesday in Asaba when a FIFA team on inspection of facilities in the stadium visited him. He vowed to put in place any further facility that would be needed for the competition. While recalling that international events such as the 21st Africa Senior Athletics Competition, Super Eagles’ matches with Seychelles and Egypt, among others had been hosted at the stadium without any hitch, he said that hosting the World Cup would be a great event that would be welcomed by football enthusiasts and all Deltans. “I am glad that you are here to inspect sporting facilities in our state; as a government, we have continued to do the best we can to develop sporting facilities and we have done very well in that area. “It is good that you are happy with the facilities we have on ground and the compliments from you will help us to continue to do the best we can; Asaba and our state generally is peaceful and I want to reassure you that we will do what we have to do if there are areas we need to improve on.
