Four persons were on Wednesday feared killed and three others injured after suspected cultists resumed hostilities at Oworonshoki, a Lagos suburb. It was gathered that the fight, which was between Aiye and Eiye cults, started around 6:30am at L&K bus stop and later spread to Olopomeji and Akinjuomo streets. The cultists were said to have stormed the areas armed with cutlasses, axes and bottles, which they used to attack one another. But for yesterdayâ€™s clash, Oworonshoki, notorious for cult wars, robberies and other violent activities, had been peaceful for some time. Among those feared killed were Ibrahim alias Iso, Mumuni Abade and Dodo. Three others sustained deep machete injuries. It was learnt that those killed were mainly members of the Aiye cult, said to have been hacked to death. When our correspondent visited the area yesterday, there was fear, as traders were seen locking up their shops. Armed policemen were also sighted at three locations conducting stop and search on vehicles and tricycles. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the police were only aware of one death. He said a suspect, Yusuf Adesafe, has been arrested, adding that peace has been restored to the area.
