After retaining his title at the 2019 ITTF Challenge Plus Nigeria Open, Aruna Quadri has shifted attention to the All Africa Games holding next week in Morocco. Quadri defeated Austria’s Robert Gardos 4-2 to become the first Nigerian in history to win three ITTF Challenge series title and the first to win and retain the Nigeria Open. However, the only title still eluding the Oyo State-born star is the All Africa Games, having lost the final to Egypt’s Omar Assar in 2015 in Congo Brazzaville. The Nigerian, who admitted playing through pain at the just- concluded Nigeria Open, is indeed eager to claim the continental gong in Morocco. An excited Quadri said after his win over the Austrian at the weekend that he hopes to get back to shape before the games. “I am very happy I got this title again, though from in the beginning I faced some difficulties with my health because I had a neck injury but I managed to gain confidence after my previous victory. “For now I have to take care of my health because I have been representing Nigeria for the past 11 days so if I do not cater for myself and my health without taking treatment I don’t know if I would be able to go for the All Africa Games. But I am aiming for the single title in Morocco,” he added.  India’s Gosh Soumyajit has described the Nigeria Open as one of the best organised tournaments in the world. “It’s a good tournament for me anyway because I started from qualifications then I reach semifinal. “I think this is quite good for me and I am playing in this tournament after one and half years so I think it’s a good comeback for me and I just want to continue this rhythm and let us see what happen in my next tournament,” he said.
