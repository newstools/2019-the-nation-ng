Leganes have made a breakthrough in talks with Chelsea for Kenneth Omeruo and they are close to agreeing on a €5 million (£4.6m/$5.6m) deal to re-sign the defender. The Nigeria international impressed on loan at Leganes last season and has been keen on returning to the Liga club permanently where he will rank among the team’s record signings. The Blues ultimately dropped their €7m (£6m/$8m) asking price which had scared off Celta Vigo, who explored a move for the 25-year-old before looking elsewhere. The Madrid club are still agreeing on how to structure the payments of the deal and therefore there is still no medical set for Omeruo’s return to Leganes. The transfer window in Spain does not close until September 2, but the club’s coach Mauricio Pellegrino wants the defender in sooner ahead of the new season.(Goal.com)
