The Sole Administrator of Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA), Felix Obuah, has warned that illegal and unregistered service providers risk arrest and prosecution to deter others. He noted that the illegal and unregistered service providers had been disposing refuse indiscriminately and at unapproved receptacles and dump sites in Port Harcourt and its environs. Obuah, in a statement yesterday by his media aide, Jerry Needam, said the persons and companies said: “The persons involved in the illegal activities go about with open trucks and approach individuals, companies, hotels, supermarkets, residential estates and manufacturing industries to dispose of their wastes. What they do is to park on the road and if they see that nobody is watching them, they quietly dump the refuse there, irrespective of the time of the day.” Obuah said the nefarious act was again done ont the Obiri-Ikwerre Road in Port Harcourt yesterday morning, noting that the sabotage constitutes a nuisance and would hamper the operations of the agency. He was displeased that the illegal and unregistered service providers would collect money from their clients, but would not dump the refuse at the approved RIWAMA’s dump sites, since they are not registered with the agency. Obuah noted that the wastes being dumped after the approved dumping hours of 6pm to 12 midnight would remain there till the evening, thereby defacing the area, since the official service providers would have closed for the day. He said: “I advise the individuals and corporate organisations who engage the services of the illegal and unregistered service providers to refrain from doing so. Individuals and corporate bodies, especially those in the hospitality industry, are urged to dispose their wastes using the services of companies that are duly registered with RIWAMA. “The illegal and unregistered service providers are warned to desist forthwith or face serious sanctions from RIWAMA and the law.”
