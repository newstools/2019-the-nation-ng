ALL things remaining equal, the people of Kwara State, especially the residents of Ilorin, the state capital, may have hit their best moment as far as governance in the state is concerned. The governor of the state, Abdulrazak Abdulrahman appears to have hit the ground running with respect to the provision of social amenities for which they had cried for years without an answer. So much so that a lot the residents are now wondering if life could indeed be this easy. For instance, in all the years that former Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki, and his successor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, held sway as governor, water was a scarce commodity in most parts of the state capital. But barely two months after the new governor assumed power, most residents of the city are now enjoying potable water. Many of the township roads that were long abandoned by previous administrations in the state are also being tarred or repaired. Local government workers, many of who were being paid only 30 per cent of their salaries are now receiving their full pay, causing some of the workers to profess that they were in bondage but are now free, while others say they have no regrets keying into the ‘O to ge’ movement whose force rooted out the entrenched regime of the Saraki dynasty in the state. Senator Bukola Saraki and other members of the opposition in the state are said to be jittery over the development, fearing that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state could be condemned into oblivion if Governor Abdulrahman continues in the same stride. To be sure, Governor Abdulrahman is a man of few words, but he appears determined to see that his works speak for him.
