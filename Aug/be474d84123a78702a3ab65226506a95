PLOY by terrorists to plant Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in massive potholes dug on the Maiduguri-Konduga-Bama Main Supply Route (MSR) was on Wednesday foiled by troops of Operation Lafiya Dole, the Nigerian Army has said. It said the terrorists had planned to launch the attack, thereby frustrating movement of troops, logistics and disrupting activities of other commuters. A statement on Wednesday by the spokesman for 7 Division, Colonel Ado Isa, said the affected area was scanned and cleared by a team of Engineers Ordinance detachment to prevent any unfortunate incident. The spokesman described the move by the terrorists as a desperate step to frustrate the gains recorded in the current war in the Northeast. He said the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division, Maj.-Gen. Bulama Biu, visited the scene alongside the Commander 21 of Special Armoured Brigade for on-the-spot assessment of the road. Quoting his boss, Ida said the conduct of intensive mobile patrols, ambushes and piqueting in the area incapacitated the terrorists’ suicide bombing methods. The spokesman added that they resorted to other means, including burying IEDs. “The affected area of the road was scanned and cleared by the team of Engineers Ordinance Detachment to allow for safe movement of troops and other road users accordingly. “The GOC charged the troops to remain more determined and committed in the operation in order to deny them (terrorists) freedom of action. “Super Camp Konduga mobilised its engineers and locals within the area to mend the affected parts of the road in order to ease free and safe movement of troops, logistics and other commuters.” “Members of the public are requested to cooperate with the Nigerian Army and other security agencies in observing, reporting suspicious activities within their respective areas and provide credible information to aid operation in order to combat the menace of terrorism and other insecurities,” he said.
