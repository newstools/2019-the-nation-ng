The Chairman of Badagry West Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mr. Joseph Gbenu, on Wednesday launched this year’s National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs) at Apa Primary Health Centre, Badagry. Represented by his wife, Mrs. Esther Gbenu, he said the NIPDs would run till Sunday. Gbenu said: “The National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs) is a national effort, in which Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is administered to children from birth to age five. The vaccine protects our children against illness, paralysis and death.” He urged everybody, especially nursing mothers, to participate in the exercise by bringing out their children. “I implore all of you to bring your children for immunisation. The vaccination team will visit homes, schools, churches, mosques, markets, and everywhere there are eligible children.” Health Supervisor Anthony Godonu hailed the council chief and his wife for their passion for the well-being of the people. The launch, Godonu said, was to reduce deaths among children. The Medical Officer of Health (MoH), Dr. Toyin Akinloye, said polio eradication is a public health effort to eliminate cases of poliomyelitis (polio) infection around the world, which began in 1988 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Rotary Foundation. Health Educator Akadiri Gabriel told nursing mothers about the dangers of polio.
