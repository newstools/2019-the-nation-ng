Traders at the weekend cleaned Ladipo market in Mushin, Lagos Mainland. The traders, across all the units of the market, for about five hours participated in the cleaning of the market, including the streets and drainages. The exercise began at 7am and ended at noon. The President, Ladipo Market, Jude Nwankwo, said they embarked on the sanitation to support the government’s aim of ensuring a clean state. He said: “We have realised that it is important to make where we sell clean. We decided to close our market to join the Lagos State Government in keeping the state clean and also to keep our market clean to enable our customers patronise us in a healthy environment.” Nwankwo urged the traders to keep the market clean. He said: “This is a contribution from all of us in the market. We do this thorough cleaning of the market quarterly. We close all shops at 7am and reopen by 12pm. “This is not the first time we are doing this. We have a committee that looks into it and ensure that the market is clean. The committee ensures that the market is kept clean and that refuse are taken to where they will be evacuated. Our customers should patronise us, we will keep our market clean and ensure a good environment.” The Chairman, Environmental Committee of Ladipo Market, Nonso Chiufo, said they are determined to maintain the cleanliness of the market. “This is our contribution to the development of Lagos State, besides the Thursday cleaning of markets and shops made compulsory by the government. We want to make the environment clean for our business to move forward,” he said. Chiufo said efforts are on to ensure the market is clean always, adding that traders have been sensitised to clean their surrounding daily after trading and pack the refuse to the designated place provided by the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). Another trader, Africanus Ogudoro, advised customers, traders and everybody coming to the market to keep it clean.
