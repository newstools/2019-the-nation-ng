The operators of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Primero Transport Services Ltd, has absolved its driver, who died in a fatal accident in Lagos on Tuesday, of any blame. Managing Director Mr. Fola Tinubu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Lagos that there was nothing the driver could have done to avert the accident. NAN reports that three people were killed and many injured when a truck allegedly rammed into a BRT bus at Majidun area of Ikorodu, Lagos. The cement-laden truck allegedly had a brake failure and skidded into the BRT lane, crushing an oncoming BRT bus with number plate LSR228XS. Tinubu, who spoke with NAN on the phone, said: “The truck jumped up the caveat into the BRT lane and hit our bus headlong. “There was nothing the bus driver could have done. “Unfortunately, we lost the driver, one other worker and a female passenger. “We are believing that the injured will fully recover. The medical people are doing their best for now, we have to keep praying for them,” he said. Tinubu urged residents not to relent in praying for the injured. He said the medical personnel were not relenting to save their lives.
