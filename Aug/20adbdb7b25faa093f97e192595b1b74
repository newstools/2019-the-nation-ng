Access Bank Plc has opened up its USSD channel –*901# to enable the instant opening of DiamondXtra accounts from mobile devices. The USSD channel option allows customers, and potential customers, to conveniently open a DiamondXtra account , confirm the number of tickets they have in a particular draw, and also find out the date for the draws from their mobile devices. Introducing the USSD channel account opening option, Executive Director, Retail Banking, Access Bank Plc, Victor Etuokwu  said the bank’s business model is all about its customers as its success can be directly attributed to their success. “We have helped millions of people save with DiamondXtra and have rewarded thousands over the last 10 years, with this year being the 11th edition. To encourage more people to save, we have digitalised the scheme to accommodate customers who are not able, for one reason or another, to go the branch to open a DiamondXtra account,” Etuokwu said. He explained that new customers can simply dial *901#, follow the prompts to open a DiamondXtra account and fund with a minimum of N5,000 to be one of the lucky winners. According to him, to join the winning train, all a customer needs to do is to save up if the customer is already a DiamondXtra customer, or open a DiamondXtra account with just N5,000 and save multiples of N5,000 to increase chances of winning. He outlined that the rewards for the quarterly draw include salary for life of N100,000 monthly for 20 years, education allowance of N100,000 monthly for five years, a N1 million rent, N1 million cash for six people and N500,000 cash for 15 persons. He added that 45 persons stand to win N100,000 each while 300 persons each are expected to win N50,000, N20,000 and N10,000. The bank will also award N20,000 as loyalty prizes to 45 persons. DiamondXtra is an interest yielding hybrid account which allows deposit of both cash and third party cheques. Hybrid means a combination of both savings and current account features.
