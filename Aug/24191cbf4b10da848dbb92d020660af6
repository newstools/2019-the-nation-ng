Real Madrid are ready to make one last approach for Paul Pogba this summer, with Manchester United facing a fight to keep him at the club in the long-term. The France international has been heavily linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu for some time and the player has hinted he would be keen to join the La Liga giants. Manchester United are adamant they will not sell this summer, particularly given they can’t replace him until January, and plan to reject any offer out of hand. But Real Madrid want to apply more pressure on the already strained relationship between Pogba and United by pushing to sign him again, according to The Times. With Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera leaving in the past eight months, United are light on central midfield options and any sale seems unlikely. But with Pogba’s agent working on a deal for months and Real president Florentino Perez desperate to deliver Pogba for Zinedine Zidane – who had made the Frenchman and Eden Hazard his top summer targets – Madrid will make a last ditch attempt to land him this summer.
