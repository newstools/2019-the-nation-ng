Justice Hakeem Oshodi of a Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja has fixed October 18, 2019 to rule on the admissibility of alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike alias Evans statements in his ongoing trial and others over alleged kidnapping and murder. The judge fixed the date after listening to the argument and submission from parties in the suit (prosecuting and defense counsel). When the matter was called Friday, the defendants counsel, Mr. Olarenwaju Ajanaku argued on the manner the alleged extra-judicial statements were taken from defendants. However, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) who is now leading the prosecution team prayed the court to admit the statements as evidence against the defendants. Onigbanjo submitted that since the defendants have admitted that part of the statements was written by them and that the other part were not written by them, such statement cannot be separated. Evans and his co-defendants Uche Amadi, Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Victor Chukwunonso Aduba and a woman, Ogechi Uchechukwu are all facing a-two count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping. The defendants were arraigned on two-count charges of conspiracy and kidnapping of the Chief Executive Officer of Maydon Pharmaceutical Limited, Donatus Dunu from whose family they allegedly collected 223,000 Euro (N100million) as ransom. They pleaded not guilty to all the charges. It would be recalled that, a prosecution witness, Inspector Idowu Haruna of Intelligence Response Team that arrested the defendants, had told the court how the defendants were arrested. He also told court that their statements were not taken under duress but rather in a conducive environment.
