An Oyo State High Court sitting in Saki has declared the installation of the Bagii of Saki, Chief Abdul- Rashid Adekoge, as valid and lawful. The judgment by Justice Lateef Ganiyu brought to climax the three-year-old case between the Bagii of Saki, Chief Abdul-Rashid Adegoke, and his rival, Prince Niass Olabode. Adegoke who was installed as the Bagii of Saki in 2016 had been dragged before the court by Olabode over his appointment and installation as the head ofÂ  the king makers in the ancient town. Also joined in the suit were the governor of Oyo, Saki west local government council, Magaji kujenya chieftaincy family, Chief Shittu Oladipo, Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters and others in suit number HSK/10/2016 Olabode had prayed the court to set aside the appointment and the election of Adegoke as null and void and of no effect whatsoever, claiming that he (Adegoke) was no more competent and qualified to contest in the second election which was conducted in 2016 pursuant to section 20(5) of the Chiefs Law of Oyo State. He also argued that the Bagii Kujenya ruling family was the rightful party from the Bagii ruling house to present the candidate for the Bagii of Saki and that the presentation of Adegoke deed from the Ladubu ruling family was wrong and contrary to the Chiefs Law of Oyo State.
