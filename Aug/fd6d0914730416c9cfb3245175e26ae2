Members of the Amoo family of the Lagos Island have appealed to the police and members of the general  public to help them in their search for their missing son. The family said Amoo Shehu Ibrahim, who would be 36 on September 22, 2019, went missing in January this year. The spokesman of the family, Amoo Karim, in a statement, said: “Ibrahim disappeared from his home in the Bankole area of Lagos Island after he was accused of being a practising gay. He was caught with his partner, one Shittu Williams, in a homosexual act by a member of a religious group he belongs to. His partner, a member of the group, was reported to have died on January 27,2019, according to his family. “Their case was taken to the leaders of the group who vowed to punish them in accordance with the rules and regulations of the religious group which abhors and condemns homosexuality or gayness.” The spokesman said the Amoo family disapproved of homosexuality which Ibrahim involved himself in and would hand him over to the police on their own, “ if we are able to find him”. “The Amoo family is a disciplined one. All its members are highly religious and decent. We frown upon gayness. We hate it. It is an offence in our country. I think it attracts 14 years’ imprisonment, according to our statute law. If we are able to find him today, we will hand him over to the police,” he said.
