Executive Chairman, Oyo State Internal Revenue Service, Aremo John Adeleke, who spoke on behalf of Makinde, reiterated that the intention of the administration was not going to over-burden any business enterprise, either small or big, but rather to ensure that government get its fair and reasonable share of all its eligible tax revenue.
