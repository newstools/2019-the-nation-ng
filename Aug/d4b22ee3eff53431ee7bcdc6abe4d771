The Board Secretary, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Mrs Foluso Ajimoti and some parents of pupils who sat for the Unified Examination for admission into secondary schools across the State have praised its organisers for a hitch-free examination. Mrs Ajimoti  said the smooth conduct showed that the State Government made adequate preparations for the examination. Ajimoti who addressed journalists after a tour of some of the examination centres in Mainland, Somolu and Kosofe areas said that the huge number of pupils who sat for this year’s edition of the annual examination shows the wide acceptability of government-owned schools. She disclosed that 160,000 primary six pupils from both public and private schools sat for the examination in 348 examination centres across the six Education Districts in all the Local Government and Local Council Development Areas of the State. According to her, the state government also made special provision for physically challenged pupils. “Going by my assessment of the schools visited thus far, it is evident that the pupils were well attended to in a conducive examination environment, there were enough examination papers and this is an improvement on what we have experienced in the past,” the Board Secretary stated.
