A Kabusa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday ordered two friends, Aliyu Hafisu and Sank Abubakar, who allegedly beat up two night crawlers, be remanded in prison custody, pending trial. The police charged Hafisu and Abubakar with joint act and causing grievous hurt. The Judge, Aliyu Kagarko, ordered that the defendants be remanded in Keffi Prisons and adjourned the case until Sept.16. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mahmud Lawal, alleged that the defendants committed the offence on Aug. 14. Lawal informed the court that the complainants, Monday Oboh and Moses Iliya, who reside in Garki Village, reported the matter at the Garki police headquarters. He said the complainants reported that on Aug. 14, while walking on Lagos street in Garki II, at about 2 a.m., the defendants, along with 13 others at large, attacked them. Lawal said the attackers, who made use of broken bottles, left the claimants with several degrees of grievous injuries. The prosecution said that the complainants are on admission in the hospital, where they have so far spent N273, 000 for treatment. The prosecution alleged that the defendants and their accomplices also stole N83,000 from the complainants during the attack. Lawal said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 79 and 247 of the Penal Code law. After the charges were read to them, they pleaded not guilty. (NAN)
