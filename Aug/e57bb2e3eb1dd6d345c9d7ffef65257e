The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday dashed the governorship aspiration of a former Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the Cross Rivers Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Frankland Briyal. The national chairman declared that only those who have spent at least one year in the party are qualified to contest its ticket. Oshiomhole, who spoke last night while inaugurating the governorship screening committee, said aside those who have spent at least one year, others who have spent less would require a waiver from the National Working Committee (NWC) to contest. Briyal joined the APC about two weeks ago when he resigned from his position at the electoral body to contest the governorship election in Bayelsa State on the platform of the APC. But Oshiomhole said any prospective aspirant would not be eligible to vie for the governorship of Bayelsa and Kogi states, if they are not financial member of the party for a year. While inaugurating the 14-member screening panel, headed by Senator Hope Uzordinma, the APC National Chairman said it would be unfair to hand the party’s flag to those who just joined when there are well entrenched members of the party angling for the governorship seats in the aforementioned states. Oshiomhole urged members of the committee to adhere strictly to the guidelines of the party, adding that the NWC reserves the right to grant waivers to any of the aspirants who does not meet the party’s guidelines. He said the August 29 primaries of the party would take place simultaneously in Lokoja and Yenagoa. According to him, the party will give aspirants a fair chance to actualise their aspirations. On behalf of the committee, Uzordinma expressed gratitude to the party for reposing confidence on members of the committee. He added that they would discharge their assignment without fear or favour.
