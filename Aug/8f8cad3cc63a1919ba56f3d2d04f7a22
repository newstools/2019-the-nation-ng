The Amirul Hajj of Lagos State, Dr. Abdul-Hakeem Abdul-Lateef has urged pilgrims to follow the rules guiding the doctrine of Hajj in Saudi Arabia. He spoke yesterday at a sensitisation lecture while hosting the Ulamau group of National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, (NAHCON) at the Lagos House in Makkah. Dr Abdul-Lateef enjoined the pilgrims to shun fake news and sermons from deceitful clerics. He said the task ahead in completing the Hajj rites at Mountain Arafat, Musdalifah and Muna required team work and self-determination. Praising the pilgrims for conducting themselves morally in Makkah, Dr Abdul-Lateef urged them to maintain the discipline and the fear of Allah inculcated in them during several  lectures in the Holy Land. The NAHCON Ulamau Leader, Sheik AbdurRasheed Adiutullahi, urged the pilgrims to reserve their energy for the task ahead. He sensitised them on the required process for the remaining rites and what was expected of them. Adiutullahi urged them to know their health status before embarking on the journey to Muna as it’s energy-sapping. As part of efforts to further position the pilgrims for a successful exercise, Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Board organised Arabic sessions for pilgrims to broaden their knowledge and ensure they have all it takes to perform an acceptable Hajj. Pilgrims ocuppy their leisure time on shopping for themselves and their loved ones within and outside Makkah.
