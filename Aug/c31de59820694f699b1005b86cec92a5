Edo State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Abubakar, has said that the forest clearing done in hotspots along the Bénin-Ore highway has helped to curb kidnappings, armed robbery previously seen on the road. Abubakar who spoke in a chat with newsmen in Bénin City said other security strategies also put in place have made the criminals fled. He said no kidnapping incident has occurred on the Bénin-Ore road since the forest was cleared. The Edo Police Boss said he took actions to take battle to the hoodlums because the Bénin-Ore highway is too strategic for hoodlums to be allowed to operate. His words, “I, as Commissioner of Police in Edo, will not sit back and allow hoodlums take over the Benin highway. “That was why we mobilised ourselves and go after them. We have followed and engaged them in shoot out and rescued several persons from them. “We discovered that they have an added advantage over us which is the forest that is closer to the road. We met with the state government to support us to clear the bush. Governor Obaseki provided the support and cleared the forest. Since we cleared the forest, they have run away. We also carried out bush combing where we destroyed a lot of camps. The hoodlums and kidnappers have relocated from Edo State now. For the past two weeks, there is nothing like kidnapping along the highway. The exercise is ongoing and we are going to sustain it. We will ensure the travelers are safe. “We have over 20 checkpoints and there are senior officers task with the issue of supervision and there is another patrol team going round the clock. We have other security measures. Edo is a no go area for criminals.”
