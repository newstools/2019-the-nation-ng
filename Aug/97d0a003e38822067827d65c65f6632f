THE convener of Igala Lagos Youth Party, Feliz Olame, has thrown his weight behind the re-election bid of the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello. Olame spoke at a press conference in Lagos organised by the group in support of the second term agenda of Bello. He said Bello’s giant-stride achievements in the last four years in the education, health, agriculture, infrastructural development and social security sectors have been commendable. Noting that ethnicity, religion and class were recurring issue in Kogi state before the emergence of the governor, he stated that Bello came with new ideas where everyone in the state can work, live and access government opportunities without any parochial consideration. Stating the weakness of Bello, he said it was the non-payment of salaries which he explained was a result of unimaginable number of ghost workers who were receiving salaries from the state, but which the governor has managed to stop. He asserted that those opposing the governor’s reelection are people of the old order who are blind and cannot see the next level programmes of the government and their effects on the people of Kogi State.
