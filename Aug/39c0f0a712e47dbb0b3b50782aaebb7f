An entertainer, Koffi Ayinde Idowu Nuel, popularly known as Koffi, has said he went into the industry to make ends meet. He disclosed this in a chat with The Nation. The comedian, who is also an actor, and singer, has won many awards. “To make ends meet, I actually trained as an actor while in school with Theatre 15.  I also took the opportunity available to me to engage in stand-up comedy and started earning from it. Music was another means of expression and brand extension. I ventured into making my own movies due to lack of investors.” Koffi, who described himself as an introvert, but eloquent and a responsible citizen, is one of the many entertainers who have been using his goodwill to campaign for the progress of the society with his skits and songs. The graduate of Chemistry from the University of Lagos, revealed that most of his skits and songs are inspired by the Creator: “God is my ultimate source of inspiration and then my environment. Reading also helps wake up my thoughts a lot,” he said. The comedian, who premiered his latest movie Mumble Jumble in June, last year, is  gearing up for the premiere of A Broken Place, on October 1. “Other movies lined up for release include The Landlady, Ewa Agoyin and Hullabaloo,’’  said Koffi.
