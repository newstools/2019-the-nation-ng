After 25 days in Saudi Arabia, Lagos contingent loses one of its pilgrims early today (Sunday). The death occurred barely two days to the completion of the hajj exercise. The female pilgrim was on her way to the Jamrat (where stoning of the devil is taking place) before she slumped.
Efforts to revived her proved abortive. She died on the spot.
