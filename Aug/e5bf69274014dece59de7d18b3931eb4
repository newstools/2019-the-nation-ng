Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says he has “no doubt” midfielder Paul Pogba will stay at the club this summer. The France World Cup winner missed United’s final pre-season game, a penalty-shootout win over AC Milan in the International Champions Cup. But Solskjaer said Pogba, who did not travel to Cardiff for the match, was not risked due to a back strain. “I wasn’t expecting him [to travel],” he said. “I spoke to him after training and he didn’t feel right. It’s not an injury, it’s just some pain. I wasn’t going to risk anything.” Reports claimed Pogba failed to make the trip to Cardiff in an attempt to force a move to Real Madrid. Solskjaer also confirmed the £80m signing of Leicester centre-back Harry Maguire is set to be announced “very soon”.  BBCSports
