It was a moment no one would forget in a hurry as management team members, family, friends and well wishers of Mahibat Abbas gathered at Radisson Blu Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos, recently, to honour the immediate past Acting Chief Financial Officer, CFO, of UAC of Nigeria Plc to a farewell party. They expressed their overwhelming gratitude to her for her unparalleled service to the conglomerate and humanity. Abbas, who joined UAC in 1984 as a management trainee, worked across different units of the company amassing wealth of experience as she held strategic positions to her credit. She served as Company Secretary, Group Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, the last position she occupied before her retirement last  April 30. The Chairman of UACN Group, Mr Dan Agbor, extolled the virtues of  Abbas. He said that apart from the fact that she worked only in UAC for 35 years, she stood tall among others in the company with her exceptional qualities. “Mahibat personifies integrity, hard work and humility,” he said as he wished her the best in her future endeavours. According to testimonies received across board, the retiree was an epitome of discipline, hard work, honesty, transparency and accountability, among other virtues. To many, she was a role model and a mentor, an unassuming fellow, humane, compassionate and caring to a fault. In her response, Abbas said: “I feel elated to leave with good health and wealth of experience. I have navigated across different positions in UAC including its Pension Fund for 12 years and they are happy with my performance. “What you see today is a reward of jobs well done.
