THE Balogun of Oba Kingdom, an Egba community, Chief Olayiwola Balogun, yesterday explained that he was the one that advised former Governor Ibikunle Amosun to establish the Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology (MAUSTECH), Abeokuta, in honour of the late winner of June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola. Olayiwola urged Governor Dapo Abiodun, “in the interest of peace and tranquillity in Ogun”, not to cancel the new university or relocate it outside Abeokuta. The Balogun, in a letter, titled: “Relocation or Cancellation of Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology”, which was addressed to Abiodun, reminded him of the two state-owned universities in the state, saying none was sited in Abeokuta, the state capital. He stated that of the 13 state-owned tertiary institutions in Ogun, seven are located in Ogun East (Ijebu – Remo) axis and the remaining six were distributed equally between Ogun Central (Egba) and Ogun West (Yewa-Awori). He also stressed that 90 per cent of the management staff of the said institutions come from Ogun East. He dared the governor to controvert him by carrying out a census of the staff of the state’s tertiary institutions. But, Coalition of Interest of Ogun West has declared that what the people of the zone want is a “public university” and not an additional polytechnic. The group said the zone already has enough polytechnics – the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, and Ogun State Institute of Technology, Igbesa, and does not need additional one as represented by the newly created Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia. The group, while speaking through the former Vice-Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Rahmon Bello, and renowned historian, Prof. Anthony Asiwaju, said Ogun West people want the new Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia, changed to University of Science and Technology, Ipokia.
