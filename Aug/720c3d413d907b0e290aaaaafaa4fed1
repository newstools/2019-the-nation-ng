Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, Thursday said his administration had completed the payment of N104bn bond it inherited from his predecessor, Chief Timipre Sylva. Dickson spoke through his Commissioner for Finance; Mr. Maxwell Ebibai spoke during the state’s monthly transparency briefing for June and July, 2019 in Yenagoa. Ebibai explained that the state government painstakingly undertook the repayment of the debt in spite of numerous financial obligations. The commissioner who noted that the Dickson-led administration is not against deficit financing, emphasized that borrowed funds must be utilized for development purposes. He said: “The state government has concluded the payment of bond that was taken by the previous administration. “And as a government, our concern is that it carries the assets and liabilities of every government.
