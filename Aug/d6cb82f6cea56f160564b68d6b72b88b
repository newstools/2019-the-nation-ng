Six months after he was born, Kehinde, son of Mr. and Mrs. Yusuf Isiaka, has known no peace. He has undergone surgeries to correct a problem in his brain- hydrocephalus, (water in the brain). Nine-year-old Kehinde needs N575,000 for the final surgery and to purchase a support chair and machine to help him walk. His father, who was at The Nation head office in Matori, Lagos, yesterday, is appealing to well- meaning Nigerians and others to assist his son. He said: “My son’s ailment started six months after he was born in September 2009, and we have so far spent N2.5million to keep him alive. “He has been taken to Ado Awaye General Hospital in Iseyin, Oyo State as well as 10 private hospitals. We took him to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan in June 2011 where he has been taking treatment.” Kehinde’s parents can be contacted on 08022300344 and 08033503135. Donations can be sent to Guaranty Trust Bank 0151945965. Account name: Kehinde Abdur Raheem Yusuf.
