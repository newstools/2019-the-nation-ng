Taekwondo continues to add to Nigeria’s medal fortune at the 12th African Games as Elizabeth Anyanacho and Uzoamaka Otuadinma settled for bronze in the women’s -67kg and -73kg of the tournament. But Nigeria’s quartet of Chiamaka Onumonu, Arinola Abdullateef, Abdulfathi Sanusi and Ifeoluwa Ajayi were unlucky in their quarterfinal ties as they missed out mounting the podium. But the unquestionable officiating cost Ajayi his place in the semifinal after his unfair defeat of 20 – 3- to Morocco’s Abdelbasset Wasfi. With this, Taekwondo had won one gold and four bronze medals for Nigeria so far in the tournament. Taekwondo event ends on Friday.
