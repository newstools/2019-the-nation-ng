Princess Lami’ah Momoh, a lawyer and entrepreneur, has introduced the first indigenous brand of CBD oil to Nigeria. In the US, retailers are vying to be the next Saks fifth avenue of the rapidly growing market for wellness products made with cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD. Nigerian consumers have been slower to embrace the CBD OIL. At the launch of The Sterling Herbal CBD OIL range of products in Lagos, Momoh said: “We realised CBD oil was not really used as it is in other countries, so we decided to partner with producers of high quality CBD OIL in the USA, to deliver the most pure, potent and effective CBD oil ever created.” Momoh urged Nigerians to embrace the oil because of its amazing health benefits. She said: “Sterling Herbal CBD oil is extracted from the HEMP Plant and will not make anyone high or give the psychoactive effect associated with marijuana. Children take the Sterling Herbal CBD OIL with no side effects. “Sterling Herbal CBD Brand consists of the Sterling Herbal CBD OIL 750MG, Sterling Herbal CBD OIL 2400MG, which is the true strongest strength ever to be seen in Nigeria. “It is three times the strength of the 750MG and recommended by doctors and medical practitioners. “One of the numerous testimonials on the vape pen is that it stops pain within five minutes of taking it. “Sterling Colon cleanser is the most effective oxygen colon cleanse ever created. It will help remove all the fecal matter and toxin waste in the body, whilst giving energy, and a great sense of well-being. People are using it as a weight loss supplement.”
