Juventus beat SSC Napoli in a remarkable Serie A game as Kalidou Koulibaly’s injury-time own goal negated the visitors’ three-goal comeback. The champions led 3-0 through goals from debutant Danilo, former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain and Cristiano Ronaldo’s first of the season. But three summer signings scored to put Napoli level – Kostas Manolas, Hirving Lozano and Giovanni di Lorenzo. That was in vain as Koulibaly booted a deep free-kick past his own keeper. Juve, who have won the last eight titles, clearly lacked the presence of captain Giorgio Chiellini – likely to be out for several months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury – at the back, with £67.5m summer signing Matthijs de Ligt making a shaky debut. Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri did not take charge against his former club as he recovers from pneumonia, although he was at the Allianz Stadium watching the game. BBCSports
