A popular lawyer, Prince Orji Nwafor Iruzu, on Monday admonished Nigerian politicians to emulate the pan-Nigerian spirit and actions of the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Iruzu, who singled out Asiwaju Tinubu for praise in a statement in Abuja, the nation’s capital, insisted that the frontline politician is not an enemy of any part of Nigeria, as wrongly portrayed in some quarters. The lawyer also praised the former Lagos State governor for his national disposition on issues bordering on unity and collective survival of all parts of the country. “He (Asiwaju Tinubu) has proven himself to be a nationalist, clearly focused on the unity and progress of the country,” Iruzu said. The lawyer stressed that Asiwaju Tinubu’s influence towards ensuring that pan-Nigerian spirit is observed in the appointment of commissioners in Lagos State is novel and worthy of emulation. He said: “Men like Asiwaju Tinubu at the helms of affairs of this nation, Nigeria, will certainly achieve a brighter and more prosperous future. “I hereby call on other eminent leaders to emulate some of the positive attributes found in abundance in Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu.”
