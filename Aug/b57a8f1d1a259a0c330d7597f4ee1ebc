If N6 million is not raised before the end of September, 2019, one month old baby Yakubu Aishah who is suffering from Truncus Arteriosus Type 1 – a heart defect, may not live until her third month! Speaking through a letter sent to The Nation dated 19th July, 2019, the Consultant Paediatrician of the General Hospital, Ifako Ijaye, Dr Oluwabiyi stated: “The above named child was delivered in our facility through Caesarean Section. She was admitted into the Neo-natal on account of respiratory distress and persistent desaturation. “She had an ECHO done which revealed Truncus Arteriosus Type 1. She will require urgent lifesaving surgery at the Babcock University Teaching Hospital (arrangements have been made for referral).” Her parents are also pleading with well-meaning Nigerians to help raise the N6million. Donations can be made to GTBank account number 0016831105. Account name: Adebayo Rukayat Oluwatosin. Her parents can be reached on 08063896139 and 08067802729.
