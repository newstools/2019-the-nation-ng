FOUR HUNDRED residents of Surulere Local Government in Lagos State have benefited from Sallah cash rewards. Council Chairman Tajudeen Ajide said beneficiaries got N10,000 and N50,000. The beneficiaries include the aged, widows, marketmen and women, artisans and other less privileged. The disbursement coincided with the council’s Third Quarterly Social Intervention programme. Ajide said the gesture was to allow beneficiaries have a good Sallah celebration. Besides, the occasion was also used to provide free medical services for residents, who got free check ups and free drugs. Members of the legislative arm were presented with their official vehicles at the event. Eight members got a Toyota Camry each while the leader received a Venza SUV. The council chief also donated buses to the Political Leaders Forum in Surulere and Community Development Committee (CDC). Ajide said the distribution was part of his appreciation to the people for their confidence in him in the last two years. He said his administration had built and rehabilitated over 25 roads. Many of the roads, he said, were not befitting before his intervention. “This is in line with our resolution to make all inner and linking roads in the council accessible and motorable for the convenience of the people and for an improved economy, ” he said. The Council Manager, Mr Akeem Adesanya, said allprojects, such as the one-storey Customary Court were aimed at adding value to the aesthetic look of the council. CDC’s Vice Chairman Pastor Toyin Ojejinmi, forum members, and Apex leader in Surulere David Adenekan thanked the chairman for the gesture, saying “it was a promise kept.” House Leader Mrs Barakat Bakare-Akande said the legislators would continue to discharge their duties as expected.
