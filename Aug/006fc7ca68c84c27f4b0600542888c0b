It was jubilation on Monday, last week, when Dr Edith Ugochi Ohaja, was announced the first woman Head of the Department of Mass Communication, University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). Dr. Ohaja succeeded Dr. Peter N. Nwokolo whose appointment elapsed on July 31. The department has not had a female HoD since its inception in 1961. Students, colleagues and alumni of the department are happy that Dr. Ohaja, who is the oldest serving member of staff in the department, got the appointment which took effect a week ago. Dr. Ohaja started work in the university on March 1, 1989. She holds a B.Sc in Sociology, as well as M.A and PhD in Mass Communication. She has written several books, including: Features writing simplified and Magazine article writing. This is in addition to scholarly articles in local and international journals. Speaking with CAMPUSLIFE in her office, Dr. Ohaja thanked the UNN management for the privilege to serve. She listed her priorities to include the remodelling of the Mass Communication programme into a Faculty, comprising seven departments as recommended by the National Universities Commission (NUC), and the construction of a befitting edifice for the proposed faculty. Other areas of attention, according to her, are: harmonious relationship among colleagues and students, in addition to compliance with global best practice. She called on the alumni of the department, who had promised to undertake the construction of the faculty, to fast-track the project.
