16 aggrieved lawmakers of the All Progressive Congress (APC) led by factional Speaker of Bauchi House of Assembly, Kawuwa Shehu Damina, have finally taken oath of office and allegiance. The Nation gathered the aggrieved lawmakers were inaugurated at a special session around 8pm on Friday at the Assembly complex. The session  was presided over by the Deputy Speaker of the House, Danlami Ahmed Kawule. It would be recalled two Speakers had emerged at the inauguration of the Bauchi House of Assembly. Abubakar Suleiman was elected by 13 members with the Clerk presiding over the sitting on the floor of the Assembly complex on June 20th. The factional Speaker, Kawuwa Shehu Damina, was elected outside the Assembly complex by 18 members under the symbol of a Mace. But the crisis seems to have been amicably  settled with the Kawuwa faction said to be loyal to immediate past Governor Abubakar Mohammed, conceding defeat as they appeared to take their oath of office and allegiance. Applauding the development, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir , who was also present at inauguration, said the victory was for the people of the state. Mohammed praised the members for settling their differences. He disclosed to newsmen that the state government resolved the crisis through intervention of relevant stakeholders, notably the traditional rulers. The APC is the majority in the House with 22 members, the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP) has 8 while the New Nigeria People’s Party is left with only  one  member.
