He noted that of the figure, over 35,000 obtained 200 marks and above at this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) organised by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). The official said that candidates who scored 200 and above were eligible to participate in the institution’s Post UTME “At least 9,000 candidates would be given placement into the University for the Various Undergraduate Programmes. “For any candidate to be considered for admission in our institution, he or she must have scored 12 points,’’ the official said. NAN reports that the Post UTME carries a total of 30 marks. “The examination started on Monday, Aug. 26 and so far, it has been hitch-free. The university acquired more computers and their back-ups, which have all been in top shape, while the tests lasted. “The electricity too was uninterrupted. We have not recorded any impersonation too, probably because of the measures put in place. “This year’s examination has turned out to be one of the best we have ever recorded in recent times. JAMB made available to us images of the candidates coupled with the biometric machines used in authenticating them. “We must also give credit to the candidates because most of them now know how the system works, how to operate the computers, thereby taking pressure off the examiners,’’ the official told.
