The letter reads, “I write to commiserate with you on the death of your dear mother, Alhaja Wulemotu Kashamu, who died on Wednesday, 7th of August 2019, at a ripe age of 96 years. “Her transition is certainly a glorious exit. I enjoin you and your entire family not to mourn, but to celebrate her great impact in business, community service and religious activities, as well as the noble accomplishments she recorded in other facets of her life, in the almost one century of her sojourn on earth. “It is my prayer that the Almighty Allah (SWT) will forgive her sins, grant her Aljanah Firdaus, and grant you and your entire family the strength and fortitude to  bear the pain of her loss. “Once again, please accept my condolences and the assurances of my highest regards.” The late Alhaja Kashamu died on Wednesday, 7th August, 2019, at the ripe age of 96.
