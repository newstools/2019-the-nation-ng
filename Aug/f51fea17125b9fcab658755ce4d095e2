Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal, has said the government will train and empower in the next four years, 15,000 youths and the unemployed in value chains in the agricultural sector. Lawal, who spoke on Wednesday in Alausa, Ikeja, added that the time frame of the training would be reduced to six months from the hitherto one year period, stressing that the aim is to increase the human capacity of youths, thereby contributing to food security. He said the fulcrum of his vision for the ministry in the next four years include food security and improved nutrition by using local production, sustenance and resilience agricultural practices, the creation of dignified jobs in the agricultural sector using technology as an enabling tool as well as economic diversification. “This training programme will improve agricultural production, train new set of farmers that will drive the development of agriculture, create employment opportunities for new generation of youths, contribute to the food security of the state, improve the standard of living of youths through self-sufficiency in agro-based enterprises and increase economic activities of the surrounding communities. Suffice it to say that the trained youths will create jobs for farm attendants, artisans and other ancillary workers,” the commissioner added. He said the government would extend the School Agricultural Programme (SAP) to correctional schools, to further stimulate the interest of youths in agriculture, particularly at that period in their development. “The major aim of SAP is to promote practical and commercial agriculture among youths, with the aim of empowering students with sound and practical knowledge of agriculture to complement the theoretical aspect taught in the classroom. The SAP intends to increase the awareness of students in agricultural productions and also to see agriculture as a source of livelihood and a major wealth creator,” Lawal said.
