The Lagos Chambers of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has raised concern over the multiplicity of exchange rates in the country, saying the situation creates undue arbitrage opportunities and transparency issues in the market. Speaking with The Nation in Lagos, its President, Mr. Babatunde Ruwase, therefore, urged the Federal Government to address the issue, noting the wide gap between the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN’s) N305 rate and other rates at N360 and above. The LCCI chief, who lauded the Federal Government’s efforts in making the forex market relatively calm with stable rates and liquidity ease across the market, however, said a market driven approach to exchange rate offers a more sustainable option of managing the forex market. “This is because the Nigerian foreign exchange earnings are largely dependent on oil, and if there is a crash in the oil receipt, the CBN may not be able to sustain the intervention. “We, therefore, need to diversify the economy so there would be more flow of forex from other sectors of the economy than just crude oil whose price remains volatile” Ruwase said. He also noted with grave concern the increasing wave of insecurity in the country especially as it concerns kidnapping, herdsmen attacks on communities, ethnic and religious clashes and many more. While acknowledging that the Federal Government through its security agencies are making concerted efforts to stem the cycle of criminalities across the country, Ruwase urged the government to be more strategic in its approach so that its efforts will yield the desired results. “It is important to stress that this wave of insecurity is doing a lot of damage to the image of the country and the economy, as prospective investors may become discouraged to invest in the economy while local businesses continue to groan under the uncertainty created by continued insecurity in the land,” he said.
