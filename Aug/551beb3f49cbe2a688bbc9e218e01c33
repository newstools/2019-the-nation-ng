Nigerians have been told to embrace sports and regular fitness with a view to keeping away heart attack which has assumed alarming proportion in recent times. The advice was given as health experts; stakeholders, Catholic Men Organisation members and sports fans alike converged on Ejigbo Stadium last Saturday for the finals of maiden Isolo Deanery Coordinator’s Cup. The championship which was action packed, drew a lot of soccer enthusiasts to the venue that is gradually turning into local Wembley. In the highly entertaining finals Immaculate Heart Iba edged out hard fighting Annunciation CMO, Ori-oke by a lone goal scored in the first half. Efforts by Annunciation CMO whose brand of football tickled the fancy of many fans at the Venue to turn the table failed as Immaculate Heart held tenaciously to their lead till the final whistle. Donor of the prestigious trophy and Isolo Deanery Coordinator Chukwudi Oparaku told Sportinglife.ng that the essence of the tournament is to use sports as a vehicle for evangelisation on one hand and foster unity among men within the Deanery on the other, assuring that the next edition will be bigger and better. Chairman Local Organising committee for the tournament Alex Iloh scored his committee 80% adding however that there is room for improvement. In the third place match, St.John Igando came from behind to beat Maria Goretti 2-1. Rev Father Kefas Martins who was very impressive on the pitch for St John Igando, called for more support for the tournament which he noted is not only a vehicle of unity in the Deanery but aimed at motivating  men to embrace fitness  while building good and God fearing families. Interestingly when both finalists met in the group stage it ended on a scoreless note.
