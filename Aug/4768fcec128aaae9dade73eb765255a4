A member representing Ohaji/Egbema/Oguta/Oru West Federal Constituency of Imo State, Mr. Kingsley Uju, has urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to declare the area as a disaster, following the flood that devastated it. More than 200 houses were submerged, 6000 persons displaced and farmlands swept away, following a downpour, which ravaged the area. Uju, who spoke while assessing the damage to the affected communities, said no fewer than 15 communities in Egbema and Oguta, had been taken over by flood. The lawmaker gave the names of the affected communities as Mmahu, Etekuru, Obiaakpu, Abor, Oguta 1, Oguta 11, Ezi Orsu, Orsu Obodo, Umuorji, Abacheke. He said the number of displaced persons had continued to rise as the flooding takes over more communities. Uju lamented that some of the victims were still trapped in their farms as a result of the flood, while appealing to the government to declare the area a disaster zone and come to the aid of the victim.
