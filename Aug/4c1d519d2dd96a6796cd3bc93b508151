Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool has begun their journey to Turkey for Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup showdown with Chelsea. The Champions League winners take on the Europa League victors at Vodafone Park in Istanbul with manager Klopp looking to get his hands on a second trophy with the club. And the squad were all smiles as they arrived at John Lennon Airport on Tuesday morning. The likes of Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane were happy to stop and greet a small group of excited fans as they made their way off the coach, while Klopp looked amused as he signed one supporter’s miniature replica Champions League trophy.

The Reds wrapped up the three points before half-time with Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Divock Origi all netting after an early own goal from Grant Hanley at Anfield. Not everything went according to plan, however, with goalkeeper Alisson being substituted after picking up a calf injury. The Brazilian will be sidelined for at least ‘a couple of weeks’ with the club set to sign veteran Andy Lonergan on a short-term deal as cover. Summer signing Adrian is in line to make his first start for the Reds. Liverpool will be hoping the match goes like their last one in Istanbul, where they famously came from 0-3 down to beat AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final.
