According to ESPN Brazil, the midfielder is going to Germany on loan. Catalan radio rac1 confirms that Coutinho has agreed to join Bayern. The Brazilian will not play against Athletic Bilbao on Friday and will travel to Germany this weekend. Barcelona and Bayern Munich have agreed a deal for Philippe Coutinho, according to a report from ESPN Brazil. Coutinho will join Bayern on a season-long loan, and the report does not mention an option to buy although that could be a part of it if the deal is made official. Bayern’s interest in Coutinho started earlier this week and it the condition for it was Barça’s negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar. Coutinho was the main piece of the talks and would go to PSG with Neymar returning to Camp Nou but if the deal didn’t work out then the German champions would act quickly. That appears to be the case now, and if Coutinho does join Bayern then it’d be nearly impossible for Barça to get the funds or convince PSG to take Ivan Rakitic to complete a Neymar deal. If the report from ESPN Brazil is accurate, Coutinho to Bayern should be official soon.
