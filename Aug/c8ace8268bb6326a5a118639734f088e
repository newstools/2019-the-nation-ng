A 33-year-old lawyer, Onome Iyomaterie, has appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding a businessman of N445,000. He pleaded not guilty to the charge of obtaining money under false pretences and stealing. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde alleged that the defendant committed the offence on April 3, at Ijaiye, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant fraudulently obtained the cash  from Mr. Taiwo Okanlawon, to register a limited liability company for him, but failed to do so. Ayorinde said the defendant disappeared after collecting the money and efforts to recover it failed. Magistrate B. O. Osunsanmi granted the defendant N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on September 16.
