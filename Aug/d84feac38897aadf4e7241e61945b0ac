The Lagos lawyer, Lolade Johnson, on Tuesday appeared at an Ebute Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos for alleged N1.2 million fraud. The police charged Johnson, 49, with four counts of fraud, stealing, malicious damage and breach of the peace. Prosecuting Inspector Oladele Adebayo said the defendant committed the offence in July 2017 at 7, Ondo Street, Apapa Road, Ebute Meta. He alleged that the defendant obtained N1.2 million from the complainant, Mr. Ayo Ayeni, for a two-bedroom flat. The defendant, he alleged, collected the money and refused to provide the keys to the apartment. Adebayo said she maliciously damaged the two padlocks the complainant used in locking the apartment. He alleged that the defendant issued a false Letter of Authority to take over the flat from the complainant. Johnson, however, pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate O. O. Olatunji admitted the defendant to bail on self-recognition. She ordered the defendant to deposit her Call to Bar Certificate. The case was adjourned till September 30.
