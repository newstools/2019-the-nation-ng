The North East Humanitarian Innovation Hub (NEHIH) is to set up Virtual Reality (VR) training academy in Yola to promote the use of VR technology in film making in Nigeria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NEHIH was launched 2018 in Yola by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as part of Federal Government effort to spur socio-economic growth and entrepreneurship through innovations. Speaking to newsmen on Thursday in Yola, the Founder/CEO of the hub, Mr Ahmad Tijjani, said the film academy would be established in collaboration with a company, VR360 Stories, known as the pioneer VR video production company in Nigeria. Tijjani said that the hub and the company had already partnered in the production of a film using the VR technology known as “Daughters of Chibok’’. Daughters of Chibok, according to him, had been selected as the only VR film from Africa to participate in the prestigious Venice International film festival coming up in Aug. 28 to Sept. 7. “Inline with our mandate of harnessing innovation and technology as powerful tools of impacting social change, we are thus proud to announce our next project with VR360. “The project is aimed at setting up a virtual reality training academy at our innovation campus, and creating more immersive stories from the north east. “The projects will help in training the next generation of talented storytellers and VR film makers from across Nigeria and Africa in immersive Programme. “For VR360 Stories and the Hub, our unified vision remains using innovation to put a human face to the challenges faced by underprivileged and unrepresented communities in Nigeria. “Daughters of Chibok remains a call for support for women and girls in rural farming communities Chibok and North East Nigeria,’’ Tijjani said. Tijjani listed setting up of 3D printing lab, provision of prosthetic limbs to victims of conflicts and entrepreneurship training for 100 women as some of the achievements by the hub within the past one year.
