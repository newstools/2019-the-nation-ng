Frontline journalist and racy columnist Dr Amanze Obi has been appointed as the Director-General of Ahiajoku Institute by Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha. The Institute, modelled after the Goethe Institute and Instituto Italiano De Cultura, is a research and cultural centre on Igbo culture, civilisation and worldview. It is an offshoot of the 40-year old Ahiajoku Lecture Series, an intellectual harvest that underpins the contributions the Igbo have made and are still making to world culture and civilisation. He is an alumnus of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), where he bagged multiple degrees, culminating in the award of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in English. Obi taught in the Department of English of UNILAG in the early years of his career. He has had nearly three decades of experience in journalism and held a number of senior editorial positions in major Nigerian newspapers. Dr Obi is a penetrating polemicist whose weekly newspaper column, BROKEN TONGUES, compels readership for its insightful flourishes. He was also a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy, as well Culture and Tourism in Imo State. He is the author of two books – Perspectives in International Politics (1998) and Delicate Distress: An Interpreter’s Account of the Nigerian Dilemma (2013). Dr Obi has since assumed duties at the Institute.
