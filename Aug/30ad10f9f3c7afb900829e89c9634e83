A cross section of traders at the popular Ojuwoye Market, Mushin, Lagos, on Friday lamented what they described as the deplorable condition of the access roads in the area and the filthy environment at the market. They explained that the situation was adversely affecting  their businesses particularly during the rainy season. The traders urged concerned authorities to take drastic measures to redress the situation. A grocery store owner, Friday Ikechukwu said the deplorable condition of the only access road in the market hampers easy transportation of goods and movement of shoppers. He also said that one of the major challenges facing traders was insecurity adding that ‘’ some of my goods were stolen about three days ago.’’ A fabric merchant, Mrs Rofiat Adebayo attributed the deplorable environment to lack of good drainage system. “I have been trading in this market for over 20 years.  The access road in this market is bad because there is  no adequate drainage to let the water flow and this area is congested. A tomato seller who asked not to be named said she suffered loss whenever it rained. “I have been selling tomatoes for over 15 years now. The condition of the environment is bad and I hardly open for business whenever it rains. “Both the state and local government authorities should come to our aid by giving facelift to the access road and do something about the filthy environment in this market which is as a result of poor drainage system.”
