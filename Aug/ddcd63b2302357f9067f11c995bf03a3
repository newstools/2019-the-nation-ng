The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwoolu, has assured the Manufacturuers Association of Nigeria (MAN) of a congenial business operating environment. Represented at the 52nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of MAN yesterday by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Commerce Industry and Cooperative, Mrs Omobolanle Ogunmola,  the governor said the state will create the right environment to boost the economy and grow  the gross domestic product (GDP). He said some businesses have relocated to other West Africa countries due to the insecurity. MAN President, Engr. Mansur Ahmed, said vibrancy in businesses has to do with local content. According to him, the business record of last month showed an appreciable improvement, stressing that this calls for celebration. He said the index of the manufacturing sector is growing very fast in tandem with building materials, financial services sector and oil and gas. The guest lecturer, Prof. Olawale Ajai of the Department of Political/Social and Legal Education, Lagos Business School,  blamed the woes of the country on the falling standard of  education. This, he said, has made productivity rate very low. This, he said has affected the human capital and production in the country. He said for example, the academic system in the 80’s was 6-3-3-4 which has changed to 9-3-4 system due to collapse of instructional infrasture that has also affected the growth of the children.
