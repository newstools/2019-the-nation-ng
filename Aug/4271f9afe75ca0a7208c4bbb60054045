Lagos-based political activist, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri has advised the Federal Government to release Mr. Omoyele Sowore from detention in the interest of peace, democracy, and his constitutional right. According to a statement, Onitiri said the detention was unnecessary, undemocratic and unpopular, and could not stand the test of time and law. “I wish on behalf of millions of Nigerian democrats and peace-loving citizens plead with President Muhammadu Buhari government to release the convener of ‘Revolution Now’, Omoyele Sowore, as his detention will continue to heat up the polity,” he stressed. He said Nigerians’ fundamental human rights to freedom of speech, association and assembly cannot be taken away from them by any government in power. “Besides, we wish to plead with our judiciary not to be used against the people, as Nigerians shall hold the judiciary responsible if our democracy should fail. “We have come a long way to achieve this democracy and it should never fail. We implore our judiciary to be courageous, stand firm with the people of Nigeria and defend our democracy.” Onitiri emphasised the importance of the Judiciary as the last hope of our people and strongest pillar of our democracy. “This is the time we need our Judiciary to be bold and courageous. We have no other country we can call our own. We must all salvage our country, Nigeria and make it work and great again.”
