Sergio Aguero was labelled a “special talent” by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola after the Argentine hit two goals against Brighton, continuing his record of scoring in all four of his team’s Premier League games this season. Aguero, who has scored with each of his last seven shots on target in the top-flight, also provided the assist for substitute Bernardo Silva to score as the champions eased to victory. “Of course we need his goals, everybody knows it. But even the days he doesn’t score, with the commitment – he is like this from day one so I’m happy for him,” said Guardiola after the long-serving Argentine, who has been at the club since 2011, took his tally for the season to six. “He is a special talent who I love from day one. We change many things, but from day one I am delighted about his commitment.” Kevin de Bruyne had opened the scoring from close range with the Premier League’s quickest goal of the season just 68 seconds after kick-off, before Aguero finished off a free-flowing move to double the lead. He made it 3-0 with a sumptuous finish from the edge of the penalty area following half-time, then Silva completed the scoring with his second touch after replacing David Silva. However, City lost French defender Aymeric Laporte to injury. The former Athletic Bilbao player was carried off on a stretcher after a collision with Adam Webster and was taken to hospital. BBCSports
