YOUTHS have been admonished to emulate the courage and abiding faith in God as demonstrated by a member of the House of Representatives from the Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency of Ondo State, Tajudeen Adeyemi Adefisoye. Making the advice, a media consultant, Mr. Wale Adegoroye, reminded youths that with determination, they could achieve unbelievable feats. In a tribute to the lawmaker, who is the Vice-Chairman of the House Committee on Army, Adegoroye noted that nobody gave the 35-year-old Adefisoye any chance in the last National Assembly election, when he contested under the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). According to him, Adegoroye pursued his political ambition on the platform of the relatively-unpopular SPD, only to become a political giant-killer in the election. He expressed the confidence that the lawmaker would justify the confidence reposed in him by the constituents in the provision of quality representation to Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency. The lawmaker has drawn up plans to impact the lives of the constituents. “Apart from his plans to touch the lives of his constituents in the areas of primary health, education, sports and provision of potable water; he is also set to roll out a Community Grant scheme’ anytime from now,” Adegoroye said. The programme, he explained, has been designed to give quarterly grants to selected market women and artisans in the federal constituency. He noted that the courage exhibited by the lawmaker had shown that youths could create a space for themselves on the political space, reminding them that the elders would not yield the space to them unless they fight for it.
