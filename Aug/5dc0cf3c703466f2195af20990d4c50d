A 28-year-old man, simply identified as Juwon, has allegedly raped a 10-year-old girl. The incident allegedly occurred at Alafia, Itele, Ota, Ogun State. The victim was said to live with her grandmother. It was gathered that on the day of the incident, she (grandmother) implored the suspect to hand over the keys to their room to her granddaughter when it was time for lunch. Unknown to the grandmother, the man had an ulterior motive. He allegedly took the girl to his room and raped her. The Nation learnt that the grandmother, upon arrival, discovered bloodstains on the victim’s dress and inquired what had happened. The girl told her that the suspect defiled her when she was not around. The visibly-shaken girl, who was said to have had bruises in her private parts, alleged: “Brother Juwon took me to his room and removed my panties. He then penetrated me. When my grandmother returned, she noticed my blood-stained dress and I told her what happened.” When questioned why he raped the minor, the suspect did not respond. The grandmother said Juwon should be made to face the wrath of the law. The matter was later reported to the Ogun State Community Social Orientation and Safety Corps. The Commander, Ejigun Unit, Mr. Talabi Ojo, said the suspect was apprehended and taken to their headquarters in Ota before moving him to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Obada, in Abeokuta.
