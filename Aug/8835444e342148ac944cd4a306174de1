The Federal Government has started repairing the Agbara-Seme Border section of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. The repair is being done by CGC Nigeria Ltd, which is reconstructing the road. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the work has reduced the gridlock on the Oko-Afo and Mowo axis of the road. The firm’s spokesman, Yunus Oloolu, said the work started on July 31 following the government’s directive. “From Magbon, the company will move down to Ajibade in Badagry; then, we will repair other potholes and ensure the road is passable. “Nobody is happy with the hardship people go through daily on the road. “But now that we have the approval of the government, in the next two months, motorists plying the road will be happy,” Oloolu said. He said massive reconstruction and repair were ongoing around Agemowo. The spokesman said the company would soon complete construction of drainage network of 4.7 kilometres on the Agemowo-Mowo Road after the sand filling. “Our workers are working daily, including Saturdays and Sundays, hoping to complete the reconstruction at the agreed time,” he said.
