Aruna Quadri’s unbeaten run at the ITTF World Tour tagged Bulgaria Open came to an end on Sunday as the Nigeria Open champion fell to China’s Zhao Zihao 1-4 in the men’s singles semifinal. Quadri who had hacked down top players including Japanese 10-time national champion, Jun Mizutani at the Bulgaria Open, was hailed by the organisers for his display at the tournament to make it to the last four of the $160,000 prize money tournament. The Chinese star was required to qualify and he defeated Quadri, the no.10 seed (11-6, 12-14, 11-2, 11-8, 12-10) to book his place in his first-ever ITTF World Tour men’s singles final. A total contrast in styles; the earlier timing, the much shorter quicker strokes of the 22-year-old Chinese pen-holder when compared with the African star, gave Quadri minimal time to exert his renowned powerful forehand. Trailing three games to one and ahead 9-8 in the fifth after having led 7-4, Quadri called “Time Out”, but it was to no avail. Zhao Zihao converted on his second match point, the contest ending in anti-climax as the Nigerian star served off the end of the table. The Chinese did not give Quadri minimal time to execute his long powerful forehand in the encounter. Quadri is expected to arrive in Morocco today for the opening match of the team event which serves off tomorrow. In the second semi-final tie, Japanese Tamakazu Harimoto dominant display versus Portuguese Marcos Freitas puts him within touching distance of achieving Gold in Bulgaria.
