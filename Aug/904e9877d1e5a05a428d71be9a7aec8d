Aston Villa have signed goalkeeper Tom Heaton from Burnley, the newly promoted Premier League club said on Thursday. Financial details were not disclosed, but British media reported that Villa would pay about eight million pounds for the 33-year-old, who made 22 appearances for Burnley in all competitions last season. “I am delighted that Tom is joining Aston Villa,” head coach Dean Smith told the club’s website here. “He’s done fantastically well for Burnley over the past few years and his experience and knowledge of the Premier League will be a major asset to us this season.” Heaton came through Manchester United’s academy but never made a senior appearance for the club. He joined Burnley in 2013 and went on to make 96 Premier League appearances. The keeper is Villa’s 11th signing of a busy season. (Reuters/NAN)
