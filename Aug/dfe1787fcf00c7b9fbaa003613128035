Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has denied allegations he bribed the tribunal Chairman, Justice W.O. Akanbi, to influence judgment in favour of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Akwa Ibom Northwest senatorial, Chris Ekpenyong. Senator Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress (APC), now Niger Delta Affairs minister, is challenging Ekpenyong’s victory. Emmanuel’s denial followed an allegation by Leo gave $1.4 million to Justice Akanbi to secure justice for PDP. Ekpenyong, in an interview, accused the governor of trying to subvert justice in favour of Chris Ekpenyong and PDP. He said: “Justice W. O. Akanbi, who many thought was a righteous judge …$1.5 million from Governor Udom Emmanuel and has recruited another judge to join in the justice-for-sale scam. “Akanbi has clearly jettisoned justice in preference for Udom’s Greek gift, since, according to him, he (Akanbi) has only two years to retire.” But Governor Emmanuel, through his Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Uwemedimo Nwoko, false, and asked Ekpenyong to substantiate his allegation with fact or face legal action. He said: “We state without …that there is …no  truth in Leo Ekpenyong’s …allegation. Governor Udom Emmanuel does not know and has never met with Justice Akanbi or any other judge in the panel… “It is… most uncharitable …for Leo Ekpenyong … to attempt … to disrepute the sterling reputation of…Emmanuel.” Nwoko, who described Ekpenyong, as “a serial blackmailer”, recalled that he had in time past blackmail Senator Akpabio, to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices (and other related offences) Commission (ICPC), adding that “Akpabio succumb to his blackmail and paid him handsomely.” Nwoko said Ekpenyong should produce evidence within seven days and publish same in three newspapers or face the full weight of his action in the court.a
