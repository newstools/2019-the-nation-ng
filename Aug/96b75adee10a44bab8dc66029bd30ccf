Hubmart Stores Limited, a leading indigenous retail giant with its first outlet located on Adeola Odeku Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, has boosted retail shopping in Omole. “The customer is at the centre of what we do and we want to ensure that we are able to provide satisfaction across all our product offerings,” says Anthony Atuche, chief executive officer, Hubmart Stores, during the opening ceremony at Omole Lagos State recently. “The launch of the Omole store is part of our expansion plan, to ensure that more consumers are able to access our products and the uniqueness of our customer service, with an ever-evolving consumer lifestyle and buying behaviour, good quality and value for money is a priority for us, which is what we have succeeded in offering consumers over the last couple of years,” Atuche added. The company disclosed that its continuous expansion has led to a positive contribution in Nigeria’s human capital development, as over 500 Nigerians have been employed as staff members to “provide consistent customer service for all its consumers.” Hubmart says it plans to revolutionalise the retail industry in Nigeria, with a long term goal to remain a one-stop centre for all shopping needs. The stores are known for providing international standard products and high-quality fresh food categories. For consumers who require a full suite of products ranging from grocery to fresh produce, Hubmart stores provide direct convenience for the busy working class, entrepreneurs or stay at home customers.
