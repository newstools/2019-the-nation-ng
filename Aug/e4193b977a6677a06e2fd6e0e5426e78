The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Rivers State Command, Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), has disclosed that police are still working on clues on the strangled 23-year-old woman, Maureen Ewurun. Omoni, through the telephone yesterday evening, stated that officers and men of the command were on the trail of the fleeing young man, who on Thursday morning in the room of a hotel (name withheld) on Peremabiri Street, D-Line, Port Harcourt, strangled to death after a sex romp, Ewurun, an indigene of Umuahia, the Abia State capital, but resident in the Rivers State capital. Manager of the popular hotel was subsequently arrested by the police, but the spokesman insisted that he was only invited to assist the command in its investigation. When asked again yesterday evening, if the manager had been released, after the police’s interrogation, Omoni was still not forthcoming, but a top police officer, who spoke in confidence, revealed that the manager was still being held by the command. It was also gathered that the recordings of the hotel’s Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras were being analysed by the police, in order to identify and apprehend the fleeing lover, to face the law and to serve as a deterrent to other criminals. It will be recalled that Ewurun’s body was found on the bed of the hotel’s room, after the lover had escaped. The body of the victim was later deposited in an undisclosed morgue in Port Harcourt.
