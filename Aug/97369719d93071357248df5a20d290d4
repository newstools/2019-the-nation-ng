To ensure adequate development of its riverside communities, the Delta State government has been advised to create the Coastal Areas Development Agency (CADA). Speaking on behalf of the Delta State Coastal Communities in Obotobo 1, Burutu Local Government Area, human and environmental rights activist, Comrade Sheriff Mulade, reiterated the need for such an agency for the coastal region. Calling on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and the Delta State House of Assembly to commence the process, Mulade told reporters that the establishing CADA will fast-track infrastructural development which include housing, roads, provision of potable water and human development such as sanitation and commercial fishing. Pointing out that the agency will give a sense of belonging to people living in the areas, he appealed to the lawmakers to consider enacting the bill. He further commended the governor for his developmental strides in the riverside communities of Burutu and Warri South West local government areas during his first tenure. Mulade, however, pointed out that no amount of political appointments can assuage the level of underdevelopment in the coastal communities. He said: “The people need an agency that will focus on the development of coastal communities beyond Governor Okowa because of the peculiar nature of the area.” Noting that the Itsekiri, Ijaw, Urhobo and Isoko ethnic groups are the marine economic base of the state, he added that all hands are on deck, awaiting the action of Governor Okowa and the state’s legislature on their demand.
