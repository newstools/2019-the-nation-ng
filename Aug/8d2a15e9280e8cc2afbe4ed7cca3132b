The Lagos State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Mr Sunday Aroni, has advised employers to prepare to pick corps members after their three-week orientation programme at the Iyana Ipaja camp on September 9. Aroni spoke on Thursday at the opening of camp for 2,016 Batch “B” Stream II corps members posted to the state. The state coordinator said his request is contained in the NYSC Act. “Your Excellency, permit me to seize this opportunity to inform the general public that the orientation programme will be ending on September 9. I, therefore, call on all employers of corps members to come to the camp on the closing ceremony day to transport and direct the corps members to their places of primary assignment, in line with the provisions of the NYSC Act,” he said. Aroni also said that doing so would make the corps members, some of whom were new to Lagos, feel welcomed. “We are just dusting the old books. Most of them are strangers in the land and may miss their way. The best way to welcome them is to come here and pick them and take them to their places of primary assignment and drop them off at the end of the service year at the venue of the passing-out parade,” he said. The state coordinator urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to build a new orientation camp for the scheme on the already allocated land in Agbowa so that more corps members can be posted to the state. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Director of Administration and Human Resources in the Ministry of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Mrs Basirat Iyabode Akinsanya, urged the corps members to be active in camp and make good use of the opportunity to acquire new skills.
