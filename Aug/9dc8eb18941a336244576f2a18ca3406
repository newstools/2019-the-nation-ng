The National Universities Commission (NUC) has approved doctoral degree programmes for the Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu (OUI), Osun State. Speaking during the fourth memorial lecture for the late Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, the Chancellor of the institution, Dr Ramon  Adedoyin,said: “Last year,  the school  played host to officials of the National Universities Commission (NUC) who were at the university for the resource inspection of post-graduate programmes leading to master’s and doctoral degrees in Mass Communication, Biochemistry, Microbiology and Computer Science. The seven-man team was made up of senior NUC officials and academics drawn from different universities. Speaking at the memorial lecture, titled: ‘Traditional Institution in Conflict Management,’ which was delivered by Dr Nurudeen  Arogundade, Adedoyin eulogised the virtues of the late Ooni and attributed the success so far recorded in the institution to him. ”Just yesterday, we heard the good news, though the letter might have been written about a week ago, that the Federal Government, through the National Universities Commission, NUC, has approved that the university could start offering doctorate programmes in courses like public administration, computer science and so on. The news came yesterday and today we are doing this ceremony.” According to him, the development was a result of the prayer of the late monarch for him while he was alive that as long as he continued to serve the people of Ile-Ife, God will continue to bless him. He described Sijuwade as his father, a mentor and his benefactor who he would forever remember.
