Flood has ravaged over 12,000 hectares of rice, cassava, sesame and guinea corn farmlands in nine villages of Malammadori Local Government Area of Jigawa. The Councillor representing Tashena Ward, Alhaji Yunusa Bulama, stated this in Malam Madori yesterday, when the lawmaker representing Kaugama/Malammadori Federal Constituency, Alhaji Maki Yalleman, visited the area. Bulama said the flood, which hit the area on August 16, had affected Tashena, Kadumunbari, Hadyan, Azumu, Kadumantudu, Dowawa, Dososo, Allahyayi and Unguwar-Jamaare villages. He said 8,000 hectares of rice farmlands were destroyed in the flood and 4,000 hectares of land destroyed contained cassava, sesame and guinea corn. Chairman of the council, Alhaji Hussaini Birnin-Kudu, said 5,000 sacks had been distributed to residents to erect sand-bag embankment at the bank of Hadejia River in the area. He explained that the embankment would check damages as water level kept rising by the day.
