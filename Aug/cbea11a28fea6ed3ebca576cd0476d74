Turkish Airlines will be unveiling new uniforms by its cabin crew as it celebrates  85th anniversay. The uniforms, the airline said, would be visible on the entire cabin crew on the long-haul flights of the flag carrier. The new uniforms in flag-red and anthracite gray colours, which were  tested on long-range flights in various climates, had been tailored to 25,000 employees for cabin crews to serve passengers. Inspired by many classical details in Turkish culture, from the currents of the Bosphorus to the artisanal glassware, ceramics and calligraphy patterns produced by local artisans, the cabin, cockpit, ground handling personnel and flying chef uniforms came to life under one design to give their passengers a brand experience. In his statement, Chairman of the Board/Executive Committee of Turkish Airlines Ilker Ayci: “The elegance and comfort of our cabin crews, which constitute the most important element of our unrivalled service quality, are of great importance for our brand that continues to fly at the top of its industry. I believe that our brand’s presence in the skies will be much more impressive when the new cabin uniforms, which bear elements of our culture, are combined with the elegance of our cabin crews. “Turkish Airlines cabin crew will now greet passengers with “welcome onboard” while dressed in new uniforms on long haul flights of the national flag carrier. Flying to the most countries in the world, Turkish Airlines new uniforms will definitely take to the skies while redefining elegance.” Italian haute couturier Ettore Bilotta designed the new cabin uniforms, which were specially sewn by Vakko, and the main fabrics were produced by Altinyildiz, based on the compliance of Turkish Airlines with flight standards.
