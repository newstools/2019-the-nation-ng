The Chief Whip of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rotimi Abiru, has called on Nigerians to embrace peace, love and unity. Abiru, who represents Shomolu Constituency 02, made the call in his Sallah message. He said: “I congratulate Muslims all over the world as we mark this year Eid el Kabir. “This year’s celebration is unique for this generation. We have opportunities to witness three consecutive Khutubah (sermon), right from Friday Jumat blessings to Arafat day blessings and Sallah day blessings.” The lawmaker stressed that the coincidence was a mark of hope. He called on Nigerians to seek peace and unity, which are important ingredients for development and progress. Abiru added: “Insurgency is not in our culture, therefore we should pray ceaselessly especially at this period for peace and unity among Nigerians.” He also called on Lagosians to support the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu to succeed in efforts to achieve a greater Lagos. Abiru congratulated the people of Bariga, his constituency, urging them to maintain peace and unity in the area.
