The gale of the RevolutionNow Protest seems to have forgotten the Agege and Ogba communities of Agege and Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government and Ojokoro LCDA areas. A group, led by the Presidential Candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) Omoyele Sowore, had called on Nigerians to join in a Revolution Now protest to demand good governance. The convener of the movement Sowore was arrested on Saturday, by the Department of the State Security (DSS), while the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu had warned against any gathering declaring such as Treasonable. Leaders of the group and other concerned human rights activists have condemned the DSS for the arrest and insisted on going ahead with the protest, arguing that a mere demand for good governance cannot be equated for treason. As early as 6 am, civil servants, traders, and artisans were seen trooping out to the various bus stops to commute to their various destinations. Bus, Okada and Keke Marwa operators, could be seen doing brisk business, even as roadside traders were seen at their spots already making brisk business. From Ogba to Agege and to Iyana Ipaja, the road was free of any encumbrance, and the Divisional Police Station at PenCinema was very calm as at 8 am on Monday. No serious police presence was felt on the roads at these locations as at 11.am on Monday.
