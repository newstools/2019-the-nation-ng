A Non-Governmental Organisation, Dr Rhoda Makinde Initiatives (DROMI), has empowered a victim of the #RevolutionNow demonstration in Osun state, Mama Sariyu Akanmu. The NGO is founded by Dr Rhoda Makinde, a physician and wife of Dr. Abiola Makinde, a member House of Representatives representing Ondo East/West Federal Constituency. After reading about the incident, the DROMI Intervention Team visited Osogbo, capital of Osun State where the incident occurred to have a chat with the old lady and identified with her. A statement by the organisation on Friday stated Makinde was not only concerned about the police assaulting the innocent woman, who was just exercising her right as a Nigerian but also wondered why a 70 –year- old still hawked to make a living and walk very long distance daily to sell her fufu. After an engaging discussion with her and inspecting her place of residence, the team concluded that she is in dire need of help. The team went ahead to donate relief materials, including a new mattress with pillow, floor carpet, foodstuff and materials that can sustain her till the end of the year. It also donated some cash for her to stop hawking Fufu but to engage in a less strenuous business. Akanmu tearfully expressed appreciation to DROMI for coming to her aid and helping to change her life. She lamented the living condition in the country is worrisome and called on the Buhari administration to listen to the yearning of the people. DROMI’s vision is to transform thousands of lives through evidenced based programs that focus on expanding women’s economic opportunities, increasing women’s rights and security, and advancing women’s political participation through an integrated approach that promotes gender equality across the society.
