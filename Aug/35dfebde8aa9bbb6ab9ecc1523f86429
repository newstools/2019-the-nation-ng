Some motorists in Lagos on Monday went on the social media to express their anger over extortion and intimidation by hoodlums. The hoodlums, they said, have constituted themselves as ‘constituted authority,’ thereby making life unbearable for people. According to the motorists, the hoodlums usually arrest unsuspecting people under the guise of working for councils. Many people, they said, have fallen victims, parting with a huge amount. A motorist, Abbey Omotayo, said the hoodlums printed and issued receipts with the letterhead of the councils they were operating from. Lagos State Government on January 31,2017 banned local government officials from controlling or engaging in traffic duties. The government said “… only the Nigeria Police, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Task Force on Special Offences and Rapid Response Squad (RRS) can perform traffic duties.” Adebimpe Adeoti yesterday on Facebook urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to look into the menace at Igando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Adeoti said the hoodlums terrorised motorists. Another motorist, Alli Azeez, alleged that the hoodlums worked in conjunction with some police officers. “The annoying thing is that they will take you to BRT park and ask you to pay,” he said. A commuter, Khadijat Kawonise, said the hoodlums arrested and collected N15,000 from her driver. Samuel Ogungbe said: “At Oshodi, very close to the local government secretariat, we did nothing, we were asking for direction. Suddenly those guys in mufti attacked us, marched us into the local government secretariat, everyone including an expectant woman. The woman wept. I was fined N25,000 and we were delayed for more than five hours. Governor Sanwo-Olu has to do something about these illegalities.”
