Access Bank Plc has collaborated with MTN at the mPulse planet to educate pre-teens and teenagers on the importance of good savings culture through fun and innovative methods. The event, which held at Landmark Event Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, saw children taking part in gamified learning platforms, such as Dreamville.ng – a community where children can learn about managing money and other financial instruments – while also providing them with exciting attractions and activities to enhance early savings culture. Group Head, Consumer Banking, Access Bank Plc, Adaeze Ume, explained that the bank is committed to engaging and empowering young Nigerians for the future by investing in their knowledge, improving their capabilities, and also designing specific products and services that give them access to more. “From our gamified platform Dreamville.ng, to Early Savers and Solo products, we are committed to helping the youth imbibe a healthy savings culture from an early age. This event reflects Access Bank’s obligation to our young customers by improving financial literacy and encouraging learning in a fun way. For example, users can earn points, badges, and rewards on Dreamville.ng for positive financial behaviours, especially by managing finances and budgets, setting savings goals and achieving them,” she said. The new initiative from Access Bank leverages digital innovation and technology to enhance customer experience and driving financial inclusion while building on its ‘More than Banking’ promise.
