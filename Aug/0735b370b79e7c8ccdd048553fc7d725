The police in Ogun State have arrested a 52-year-old man, Emmanuel Ikhine, for allegedly raping and impregnating his teenage daughter. The suspect was arrested last Saturday at his 6, Iyaniwura Street, Joju home in Sango Ota, Ogun State.

The victim alleged that Ikhine usually raped her whenever she was home alone, adding that he would threaten to deal with her if she disclosed it to anyone.

Confirming the incident, spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the suspect had been arrested and he confessed to the crime. “He made a confessional statement that he has been having carnal knowledge of the victim long before now. “The victim was taken to the general hospital where it was confirmed that she is pregnant. “Police Commissioner Bashir Makama has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit for further investigation and prosecution,” Oyeyemi said.
