The National Council of Managing Director of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA), has advised the Presidential Task Team to engage terminal operators and shipping line agencies on the need to evacuate and receive cargoes  as at when due. The council said the existing traffic situation on the ports access roads’ corridor can be attributed to obsolete equipment the concessionaires have, adding that the shipping companies have failed to provide the needed holding bays for empty containers. Its Deputy National President, Prince Adeniyi Ajayi in a chat, accused the terminal operators of frustrating efforts so put in place by the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo Task Team  to ease traffic in Apapa and its environs. Adeeniyi alleged that most of the terminal operators in Lagos ports are short staffed, a situation he noted has created bottlenecks on the access roads. According to him, obsolete equipment and dearth of workers contributed to the delay of cargoes entry and exit from the ports. He, therefore, urged the Presidential Task Team,led by Kayode Opeifa, to engage the concessionaires in mapping out strategies on how to improve the traffic situation in Apapa. “They have not approached the real problem. Where the problem lies is thesè terminal operators, if they are operating in their full capacities, receiving empties as at when due then  loading will be seamlessly carried out. But what I notice is that when you enter into a terminal, they will show you equipment but most of the equipment are obsolete.
