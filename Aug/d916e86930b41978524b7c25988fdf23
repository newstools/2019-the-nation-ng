The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Kano State yesterday rendered free medical services and donated essential commodities to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and orphans. NYSC Coordinator Alhaji Ladan Baba said the gesture was part of activities marking the 46th anniversary of the scheme. He noted that the celebration in Kano was being carried out under the scheme’s Health Initiatives for Rural Dwellers (HIRD). Baba said  the gesture was also part of the scheme’s social responsibility to touch lives of those in need and make life easier for them. “These people are part of us, there is no way we can abandon our responsibility to ensure that we make them flow along through our various activities. “The beneficiaries of this gesture are over 200 children, whose parents met their untimely end as a result of insurgency that engulfed the Northeast… “Therefore, we see the need to assist them with some food items, toiletries and learning materials, which are contributed through …community Development Service (CDS) groups in the state. “This is in addition to the free medical services rendered to over half of the children in the camp,” he said. Baba urged the children to remain steadfast so they could grow to be worthy members of the society. The humanitarian group of the NYSC Kano State also visited the Nassarawa Children’s Home where food items were donated and free medical services rendered. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the beneficiaries hailed the NYSC and called on wealthy individuals, governments and private organisations to emulate such. The NYSC coordinator also led the team in Kano and some corps members to Kantin Kwari market for voluntary sanitation.
