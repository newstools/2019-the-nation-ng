The Group Managing Director of Artee Group, Mr Haresh Keswani, has been honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Besides, Spar, the retail store brand of the group, emerged the Retail Brand of the Year. The honours came from the BusinessDay Nigerian Business Leadership Awards held at the Lagos Continental Hotel at the weekend. The awards were in recognition of Keswani’s pioneering effort in the second-wave retail revolution in Nigeria, through the birth of Park ‘n’ Shop, leading the business to become a dominant player in the retail industry. Other businesses managed by Keswani include Cascade Water in PET bottles, Millennia Furniture and shopping malls in Port Harcourt, Enugu and Calabar. The sectoral award won by Spar was in recognition of its business agility, market share growth, financial strength, leadership vision and resilience in various economic conditions. Keswani said it was a great honour which showed the efforts of the company in touching lives. “I am grateful to God, family, friends and colleagues who have enhanced the vision till date. I am glad to have touched people’s lives in various ways and our organisation would not be deterred in supporting laudable initiatives of the government. Many of our businesses are in response to the government’s policies and this has further enhanced the economy of the country. We believe in Nigeria and Nigerians; we know that there are huge opportunities in the country despite the challenges,” he added.
