The comeback of the Nigeria women table tennis team was thwarted by Dina Meshref as Egypt beat Nigeria to the gold medal and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games ticket in the team event of the 12th African Games holding in Rabat, Morocco. The Nigerian ladies were down 2-0 but spirited efforts from Edem Offiong and Olufunke Oshonaike to put the match beyond the Egyptians were thwarted by Dina Meshref in the fifth match for Egypt to win at 3-2. An excited Meshref said: ” We are so excited winning the gold medal and most especially qualifying for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. “We really prepared for this match and we knew it was going to be tough even when we were leading 2-0. We had thought we could the match at 3-0 but we had to fight till the end. Nigeria team is not a pushover and we prepared very well for this kind of match because we had expected it. I am so happy that we have now secured our place in Tokyo.”
