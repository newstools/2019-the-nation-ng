Kidnappers struck in two different locations in Enugu, making away with the daughter of a former aide to former Governor Chimaroke Nnamani, Frank Anioma. The incident occurred within the New Haven axis of Enugu. Anioma said his daughter, Kosiso, was on her way to the New Haven market when she got missing. “Her phone was ringing when we called her number but there was no reply. Thereafter, it went into busy,” Anioma posted. The second incident took place in the night at Amokwe, Udi local council along old Enugu-Awka Road where a Nnewi- based businessman, Chief Ernest Otugo and his wife were kidnapped by unknown gunmen. Otugo, who is said to be the President of the Ibite Olo Community in Ezeagu local council, was with his friend, simply identified as Chief Reuben as well as his children. Otugo, his wife and his friend, Reuben, said to be an indigene of Awka, Anambra state were taken captive leaving behind the children. They were travelling to Enugu from Nnewi to attend a social function billed for Friday in a chocolate Toyota Venza. However, the wife was later released by the kidnappers for her to go and arrange for the kidnap ransom. The amount was not mentioned. Enugu state Police Command through its spokesman, Superintendent Ebere Amaraizu, said the anti- kidnap operatives were on top of the situation.
