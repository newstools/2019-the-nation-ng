VICE-President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday said the Federal Government will expand its MarketMoni and TraderMoni interest-free loan scheme to cover more rural dwellers. The Vice-President spoke at the Keffi old market in Keffi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. It was during the assessment visit of the loan facility in Keffi, the state capital. Osinbajo said President Muhammadu Buhari had given the directive that the MarketMoni/TraderMoni loan programme would be extended to all the states of the federation. The Vice-President said the extension of the Federal Government-backed loans scheme is to ensure that it achieves the intended objective. He advised the beneficiaries of the loan to pay back to enable other intending beneficiaries to benefit from the programme. “We want to assure you that we are going to do more as President Muhammadu Buhari has directed us to expand the scheme so that those who have not benefited from the TraderMoni and MarketMoni will also benefit.” “It is very important to pay back the money so that the scheme will work effectively,” Osinbajo said. Governor Abdullahi Sule hailed the Federal Government for taking the loan scheme to the state. He said it would contribute to the economic prosperity of the state. The Executive Director, Micro Enterprise, at the Bank of Industry (BoI), Toyin Adeniji, said 3,000 beneficiaries enrolled for the scheme in three days.
