Kano State Private and Voluntary Institutions Board has warned private school proprietors in the state against arbitrary school fees increment. While sounding the warning, the Acting executive secretary of the board, Malam Yakubu Abdullahi Mailafiya said that where such increment became necessary it must be with the consent of the board and the Parents Teachers Association of the school. He expressed worry over the practice of compelling parents to purchase books and uniforms from the schools, stressing that parents must be given recommended list of books and samples of uniforms to purchase at their discretion. Mailafiya underscored the need for parents to be vigilant in the schools they enroll their wards promote better learning environment. According to him, forming strong and functional PTAs would provide an avenue for discussion and on how to better run schools. He, however, revealed plans by the board to embark on serious monitoring of the schools, and warned schools operating without proper registration to do so or face penalty and closure.
