Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Toby Okechukwu has hailed Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi on his decisive steps to address insecurity in the state. Okechukwu, who represents Aninri/Awgu/Oji River Federal Constituency, described Ugwuanyi’s decision to personally lead security agencies to comb and identify suspected criminal hideouts as bold and exemplary. In a statement yesterday, the lawmaker said: “I must praise the governor, on behalf of our constituency, for taking the battle of sustaining Enugu’s position as one of the most secured states to Umuogba Ihe tunnel; Agbogugu and Isu-Awa- Agbudu caves; Ihe-Agbogugu-Ogbaku-Isu Awaa and Amuri forests, among others. “For decades, criminal elements have exploited the topography of the area, especially the hills, caves, tunnels, and thick forests as launch pads, escape routes, and hideouts for robberies, kidnappings, and other nefarious operations. But by taking the battle to their dens and making these hideouts inaccessible to criminals, one can boldly say that security challenges in this part of Enugu State will soon become a thing of the past. “Additionally, the creation of more checkpoints in that axis, ongoing recruitment of Forest Guards as well as the manpower boosting and monthly stipends for the neighbourhood watch groups will further enhance security in the state.”
