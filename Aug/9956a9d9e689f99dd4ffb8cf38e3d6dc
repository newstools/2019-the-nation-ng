RENOWNED Pharmaceutical company, May and Baker (M & B) Plc, has appointed CANOD Advertising, as its preferred agency to handle its  M & B Paracetamol campaign. The appointment followed a rigorous pitch process that involved four leading media agencies at which the firm emerged victorious and the subsequent hard negotiations that further confirmed it as an agency deserving of the media account. The pitched brand, M & B Paracetamol, “the Red one”, has fast acting and effective tablets as well as pleasant tasting pineapple flavoured syrup for children. M&B’s avowed aim to sustain its dominance of this particular market category with “the Red one” led to its resolve to partner with an efficient agency hence the need for the pitch and the eventual triumph of CANOD. The campaign which commenced in the last week of July is flighted on both television and radio with its execution in both English and vernacular languages to effectively penetrate the target markets.
