BBNaija housemate and social media influencer, Tacha, in a conversation with fellow housemate, Sir Dee has apologized for her wrongdoings and misbehaviours. She said “I know my flaws, I know my transgressions, I am human and I am sorry if I hurt anyone. I’ve been so optimistic maybe in a rude way, that’s an irresistible part of me. I will limit my bravery, chain my pride and strength.” This is coming after Big Brother attacked her for being rude and disrespectful to authority and Ebuka and issued her another strike. The strike, however, is the second the Port Harcourt influencer would be getting upon entry into the Big Brother House.
