Despite missing the first opportunity to actualise her dream of making it to her 7th Olympic Games in Japan, Olufunke Oshonaike believes her ambition is still alive. Team Nigeria was beaten by Egypt in the final of the 12th African Games in Morocco, and the Egyptian secured their continental sole slot to Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. A disappointed Oshonaike told our correspondent that she was pained by the loss but remains hopeful that she can fulfill her dream in the continental qualifying tournament holding in Tunisia next year. “I am really not happy that we lost narrowly to the Egyptians again this year. We were all in good shape for the encounter but the doubles lost really cost us the match. “But this has not stopped me from aiming for my seven Olympic Games. I still have the chance to compete against others at the qualifying tournament as the only setback for us was that we would not be playing in the team event of the Olympic Games in Japan,” she said. Oshonaike however, said that Nigeria still has the chance to battle for the remaining five gold medals with Egypt. “We are not going to be discouraged by the defeat in the team events as we are still in race for the overall title. There is no doubt that the team event was our target from the start but it is another wake-up call for us to do well in other events,” she added. Oshonaike has featured in six Olympic Games since her debut at the 1992 Atlanta Olympic Games in United States.
