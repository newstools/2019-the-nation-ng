The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) have urged the 12 members-elect of Edo House of Assembly, currently in Abuja, to present themselves for inauguration. NLC Chairman Sunny Osayande said absence of the 12 from the Assembly was denying those who voted them for true representation. He said: “We advise the 12 Edo House of Assembly members-elect currently in Abuja to put aside sentiment and come forward to be inaugurated so that they can assume their law-making function… “We read with delight, report of the inauguration of the factional lawmakers in Bauchi State. We laud their maturity and recommend similar bold and people-spirited move for our Edo members-elect.” NURTW Chairman Odion Olayes said: “These members-elect were elected to represent their various constituencies in the Edo House of Assembly. But their absence means that the issues that affect people in their constituencies are not mentioned, highlighted or debated.” Akere Odigie, of the Butchers Association, described their absence as bad for democracy. “We urge the members-elect to put the interest of the voters, who stood in the sun and rain to elect them, ahead of personal squabbles,” he said.
