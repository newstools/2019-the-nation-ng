The Plateau House of Assembly has approved the request by Gov. Simon Lalong to appoint 15 special advisers to serve in his government. The approval followed a communication from the governor on Wednesday seeking the approval of the assembly to appoint 15 special advisers. The governor said that the governor’s request was in accordance with section 196 Sub-section 2 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. “In my bid and determination to form a formidable team that will help me achieve my mandate, I hereby seek the approval of the House to appoint 15 Special Advisers to serve in my government,’’ he said. The House, thereafter, approved the governor’s request through a voice vote. (NAN)
