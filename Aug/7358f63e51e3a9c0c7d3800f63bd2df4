Stakeholders have described the appointment of Dr. Salako Idris as the new Lagos State Commissioner for Physical Planning & Urban Development by Governor Babajide  Sanwo-Olu as a square peg in a square hole. According to those familiar with the sector, the appointment of Idris is encouraging, inspiring and worth celebrating. They said until his appointment, Idris was the Managing Partner, Adesanya Salako & Associates; member of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP) and a member at the Town Planning Registration Council of Nigeria (TOPREC). As a first-time commissioner,  they said Idris should win the confidence of the people, by reassuring them that he is the right man for the job. Like other commissioners, Idris should translate the promises of Governor Sanwo-Olu into action. Lagos is a city with enormous opportunities and potential. A cultural melting pot, it is estimated that an average of 6,000 persons from various parts of the country come into Lagos daily. Thus, the city is only growing in population but withoutcorresponding infrastructure development, a challenge ldris has the right credentials to solve. He, however, joined the public sector between 2001-2003 as a Town Planning Officer at Oshodi-Isolo Local Planning Authority. Dr. Idris established Adesalako & Associates in 2004, where he has managed, conceptualized; as well as executed several projects in Nigeria. These projects include but not limited to Ikorodu Sub-Region Master Plan (2016-2036); the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development (2016); Large/medium/Small Scale Agro-Industrial Parks at Imota Ikorodu; Mowo, Lagos-Badagry Expressway; and Ibeju-Lekki.
