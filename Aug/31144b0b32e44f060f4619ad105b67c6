He had his football career in Iwuanyanwu Nationale, Ajax Amsterdam, Inter Milan of Italy, and English clubs Arsenal, West Bromwich Albion and Portsmouth. He signed for Arsenal in February 1999 for £4.15 million and scored 37 goals for the club, which included scoring a hat trick against Chelsea in Stamford Bridge, as the Gunners came back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 victory on 23rd October 1999.
