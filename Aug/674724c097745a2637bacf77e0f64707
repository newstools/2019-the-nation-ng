Barely four days a Catholic priest, Rev Father Paul Offu was shot dead, and a commercial driver, Kenneth Igwe abducted, a traditional ruler was on Thursday night kidnapped almost on the same spot. The royal father, Igwe Sunday Orji was abducted around Ogbaku-Umuogbe end of the ever-busy Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway, a shouting distance from where the Catholic cleric was shot. Spokesman of Enugu State Police Command, Ebere Amaraizu while confirming the story assured that the police have swung into action to rescue the monarch. However, family sources said the abductors have established contact with them with a demand of N50m ransom. The police, however, could not confirm the ransom angle. The Awgu axis of Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway recently has become a hotbed of terrorist activities. Herdsmen have been accused but the police have warned against such hasty conclusions.
