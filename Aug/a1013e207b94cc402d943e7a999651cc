Substitute Gabriel Jesus had an injury-time goal ruled out by VAR as Tottenham left Manchester City with a 2-2 draw, scoring with their only two shots on target. Jesus looked to have extended Man. City’s winning Premier League run to 16 games with an effort on the stretch, but a handball in the lead up by Aymeric Laporte meant Spurs benefited from VAR again, just four months after their historic Champions League quarter-final at the Etihad. Manchester City went ahead on Saturday evening through Raheem Sterling’s deft far-post header from a superb Kevin De Bruyne cross (20), but Spurs were soon level as Erik Lamela’s low, curling effort from 20 yards found the bottom corner (23). The champions went into the half ahead through Sergio Aguero’s sweeping close-range finish, again from De Bruyne’s wondrous right-wing delivery (35), but Spurs levelled again through Lucas Moura’s header, his first touch after being subbed on (56).
