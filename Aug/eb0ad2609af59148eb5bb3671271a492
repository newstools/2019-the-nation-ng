To keep fit and stay healthy, wife of Ondo State governor Mrs Betty Anyanwu Akeredolu has advised Nigerians to adopt yoga. Mrs. Akeredolu gave advice at the ongoing BEMORE Boot camp for Naija 2019 at the Elizade University Stadium in Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State. No fewer than 300 girls are participating in the camp. She noted thatÂ  the exercise provides one with sound health as it involves moving every part of the body in straight and bend directions, stretching some jointed parts and the neck. She said the fact that some people were looking older than their age, in their youth, was as a result of inadequate physical exercises. Mrs Akeredolu stressed that illhealth among Nigerians might not be unconnected to their lackadaisical attitude to physical exercises despite that they take balanced diet. Earlier, Mrs. Akeredolu had introduced taekwondo training for girls as panacea for domestic violence, especially sexual molestation by men. The training is expected to take place throughout all the states. Yoga is a part of Hindu training aimed at promoting control of body and mind.
