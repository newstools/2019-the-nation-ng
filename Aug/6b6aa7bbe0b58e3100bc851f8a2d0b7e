 Former Super Eagles forward Osaze Odemwingie is one of the star players to feature in this year’s edition of Copa Del Cure Leukaemia, an annual six side championship billed for St Georges Park  on October 22. Organisers expressed a delight getting the Nigerian on board while looking forward to a fun filled event that will surpass the 2018 edition. Taking to the social media the organisers said “Not so long ago this guy would have been preparing for a new season with @WBA Delighted to say that @Odemwingie P is our latest star signing for the @CopaDelC at @St Georges Park in October. Let the games begin!” Activities of the event are not only aimed at giving teeming former  footballers an opportunity to play again but also to raise funds to help leukaemia victims. Former Super Eagles and Wolverhampton Wanderers number one goalkeeper Carl Ikeme who was diagnosed of the disease in the summer of 2017 is among former players that have benefited from the activities of the outfit. The inaugural Copa Del CL according to organisers proved a fantastic success as football fans and former players joined forces for a tournament at St George’s Park to raise money for Cure Leukaemia. The six-a-side tournament at the magnificent England training base proved hugely competitive, but also plenty of fun, as 16 teams battled it out for the coveted trophy. Odwmwigie who last played for Indonesian side Madura United and announced his retirement on 3rd April 2019 remains a die-hard follower and supporter of the Super Eagles, volunteering regular opinion during tournaments like the last world cup in Russia and the recently ended Nations cup in Egypt where the Eagles finished in the third place. The Nigeria Olympic team ace and former Stoke City forward made over 63 appearances for the Super Eagles between 2002 and 2014 scoring 10 goals.
