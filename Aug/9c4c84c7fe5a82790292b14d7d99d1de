Enyimba will begin their march to Burkina Faso today when they make their road journey to Lagos in preparation for their tomorrow’s trip to Ouagadougou ahead of this weekend’s CAF Champions League preliminary round, first leg tie against Rahimo. The People’s Elephant will leave aboard Ethiopia Airways which will make a brief stopover at the Eyadema, Lome Airport before connecting a flight to Ouagadougou, as there is no direct flight to the Francophone West African nation from Lagos. A top official of the team informed NationSport that the People’s Elephant targets an away win in Ouagadougou even though they know that the game won’t be easy against the Burkinabe side which they know only a little about. Enyimba is making a return to Africa’s lucrative club competition for the first time since 2016 when they got to the group stage of the competition before crashing out. Usman Abd’Allah’s men, however, featured in the last year’s CAF Confederation Cup where they got to the semi-final of the competition before bowing out to Raja Casablanca of Morocco.
