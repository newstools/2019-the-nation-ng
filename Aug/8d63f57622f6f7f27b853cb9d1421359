The Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association (YYSA) has called on National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCD) to ban production of films with suicide scenes. Mr Olalekan Hammed,National President of the association, in a statement on Monday in Osogbo, said suicide rate was alarming, adding that negative roles of suicide in most home videos was contributing to the menace. He said watching of suicidal films had made people, especially youths to see it as an ordinary measure someone could take to free himself or herself from frustration. “Film producers should be encouraged to use the medium to promote tolerance, endurance and professional steps that could be used to resolve issues rather than committing suicide. “It is not an overstatement to say that, all forms of immoralities and abnormal behaviour being exhibited by Nigerian youths were adopted through music and films they watch. “The National Films and Video Censors Board needed to do more to curtail moral decadence and abnormalities in the country. ” It is like the regulatory body has derailed totally from its primary assignment which is to regulate films and video production in the country”, Hammed said. He also implored the Federal Government to appoint religious leaders and custodians of culture as members of the board to help the board achieve its mandate. (NAN)
