A new champion has emerged in Africa as Nigeria’s Olajide Omotayo defeated compatriot – Aruna Quadri to win the men’s singles title at the 2019 African Games in Rabat, Morocco. Omotayo, who defeated two former champions – Egypt’s Ahmed Saleh and Nigeria’s Segun Toriola in the quarterfinal and semifinal stages, was in his best against Quadri. He raced to lead from the start of the match winning the first three games at 13-11, 11-9, 16-14. But a spirited effort from Quadri claimed the fourth and fifth games at 8-11, 13-15. But in the sixth game, Omotayo was in full force to humble Quadri at 12-10 to become the new African champion at 25. “I am very happy winning the African Games. I am so proud of myself becuase this is a big one for my career and it was a good journey for me from the start of this competition having won against some of the best players in the continent,” Olajide Omotayo said.
