A lecturer at the Federal University, Dutsinma, Katsina State, Abubakar Idris,  has been abducted by gunmen. Spokesperson for the Katsina State police command, Yakubu Sabo,   said the lecturer was abducted on Friday in his Kaduna residence. Sabo said the Barnawa police division informed the command that two unknown persons gained entry into Idris’ apartment to whisk him away. According to him, patrol teams led by the DPO quickly moved to the scene but the hoodlums had escaped with the victim. He said investigation later revealed that the victim was likely trailed by the hoodlums “while returning home at about 01:00hrs”. “The unidentified men forced him to enter his ash-coloured BMW car with registration number not yet known and zoomed off to an unknown destination,” he said. “The command is currently making efforts to apprehend the fleeing suspected criminals and rescue the victim.” Last month, gunmen had abducted a director with the Sharia court of appeal in the state, killing her son.
