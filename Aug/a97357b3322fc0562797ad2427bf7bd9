Members of the Inter Party Advisory Council in Kogi State, on Friday, walked out of the stakeholdersâ€™ meeting organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over alleged negative role of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. James Apam, in the last general election. The Kogi IPAC spokesman, Ibrahim Itodo, said they had lost confidence in the REC and demand he be posted out of the state. According to him, they found the REC consistently compromising his position and duties and acting in ways inimical to the feelings of majority of voters in the state. He accused the REC of hobnobbing with the Governor Yahaya Bello administration and deliberately shutting out the opposition in the state.
