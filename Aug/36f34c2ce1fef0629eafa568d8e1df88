The 16 local government chairmen of Kwara State All Progressives Congress have opposed call for the resignation of the state party’s chairman, Bashir O. Omolaja. The council chairmen called the people behind the move as self-serving and agents of destruction, adding that they were crying wolf where there was none. A group known as Congress of Kwara Youths, had on Monday this week issued a quit notice to Bolarinwa, urging him to resign his appointment with immediate effect. Spokesperson of the group, Mr. Ishaq Ibrahim, who read the resolutions, gave the party seven days ultimatum to remove the APC chair from office. But in a statement, the 16 local government APC chairmen said “as party chairmen at the local level and members of the state exco, we should know better. To the best of our knowledge, every member of the state exco has a voice in all decisions taken. The state chairman is a democrat to the core. We have implicit confidence in his leadership and style. We consider the group’s claim as merely playing to the gallery and doing the bid of its sponsors.”
