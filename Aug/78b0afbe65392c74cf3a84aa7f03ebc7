An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos has sentenced a 23-year-old car wash operator, Adeyemi Adetula, to four years imprisonment for stealing a car valued at N3million. Magistrate Mrs. B. O. Osunsanmi pronounced the verdict after the defendant pleaded guilty to the two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Osunsanmi, who did not give Adetula an option of  fine, sentenced him to a term of one year with hard labour on the first count of conspiracy and three years for stealing, but ordered that the sentences should run concurrently. “You are hereby sentenced to one year imprisonment for conspiracy and three years for stealing. “The sentences will act as a deterrent to others who may want to engage in similar acts,’’ she said. When the case was called last Friday for a review of facts and sentencing, Adetula still admitted guilt and the magistrate consequently convicted and sentenced him. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde told the court that the defendant, a resident of Abule-Egba, Lagos, committed the offences in May at Abule-Egba, Lagos. He said the defendant bolted with Mr. Lucky Onaghise’s car valued at N3million. “The complainant drove his car to the car wash centre and gave it to the defendant for washing. “By the time the complainant looked at the direction where he parked his car for washing, he could not see the defendant or his car and he raised the alarm. “Colleagues at the carwash centre called the defendant’s phone several times, but he refused to answer the calls.’’ Ayorinde said the defendant’s phone was tracked and he was arrested in Ondo State, but he had already sold the car.
