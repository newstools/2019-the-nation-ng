NATIONAL President of apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, John Nnia Nwodo, says he has left the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, to God and the law. Nwodo’s remark was contained in an open letter to Ndigbo concerning an online video in which Kanu made series of allegations against him. “I have noted the threats to my life from the IPOB leader.  I leave that to God and the law,” Nwodo wrote. Calling on South East leaders to condemn the IPOB leader’s action, Nwodo said: “Ndigbo, I have championed your cause with every amount of energy in me.  I have worked with little encouragement or assistance. Thank God my team and I have elevated Ohanaeze Ndigbo to an enviable status.  It is dangerous for our solidarity and ultimate success if we allow these vituperative outbursts to truncate our solidarity. “In spite of all I say, I salute Nnamdi for his courage and his persistence in upholding our case but I urge you all to rise up and condemn what is condemnable.  Speak up and shame those who would want us to split into pieces and destroy our resolve to fight as a united people. As a father, I will always forgive an erring child but not without drawing his attention to a misdemeanor which should never be repeated.
