A Yaba Magistrates’ Court yesterday sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, a 27-year-old cultist, Samuel Kalu, who stole an Infinix Hot 6 valued at N41,000. Magistrate S. O. Obasa convicted Kalu following his guilty plea to a two-count charge of stealing and membership of an unlawful society. Obasa did not give Kalu an option of fine. She said the sentence would act as a deterrent to others, adding that cases of cultism and theft were becoming rampant among youths. Obasa advised the convict to be of good behaviour and avoid crime. “Having considered the facts of this case and that the defendant did not waste the time of this court by lying, and noting that he was a first-time offender, coupled with his plea for leniency, I hereby sentence him to 18 months imprisonment on both counts without an option of fine,” she said. The convict, who lives at Ajegunle, Lagos, was arraigned on July 24. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Oriabure said the defendant committed the offences on July 7, at Akimbo Street, Ajegunle. He alleged that the convict collected Miss Favour Anih’s Infinix Hot 6 on the pretext of repairing it for her. Oriabure said Kalu, who was later discovered to be a member of Aiye confraternity and a pick-pocket, collected the phone and ran away.
