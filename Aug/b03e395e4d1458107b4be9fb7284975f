Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has promised to preside over an open and transparent administration that will be the pride of the Centre of Excellence. He said: “I must continue to raise the bar of performance. We need to get to the next level that is better than yesterday.” The governor told reporters at the State House, Marina, at the weekend that, at the end of four years, Lagos will not remain the same, stressing that his administration will be decisive in its determination to fight poverty and create opportunities for businesses to thrive. Noting that last Saturday marked his 74 days in office, Sanwo-Olu said “it has been 74 days of ups and downs, 74 days of essence of governance, 74 days of rebirth of me and glorious things happening in Lagos State.” Reiterating his determination to make a difference, he added: “It should be better. People are watching and conscious of what you do. I thank the media for support. I thank God for being at the helm of leadership of the City State of Lagos.” The governor described the journey of administration as a long marathon, recalling that he got the first baptism from the media when he went to Abuja, only to realise the second day that the least aspect of the short interview with him about his lost weight was reported. Sanwo-Olu said the last 74 days were characterised by pressures, hard work, assessment and strategic interaction with the civil service to know the state of affairs and challenges. He said his choice by Lagosians and the conferment of a popular mandate on him were not lost on him. Sanwo-Olu promised to do what will delight the media and sustain the confidence of Lagosians in his ability to deliver the dividends of democracy. He added: “At the end of the four years, Lagos will not remain the same.”
