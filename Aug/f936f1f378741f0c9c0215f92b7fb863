Nigeria international John Ogu reiterated on Wednesday that he will soon get a job in Europe. The Super Eagles player was confident about securing a deal with right offer soon in an online post on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m aware that TeamOGU are all curious to know where I will be playing next . I just want to urge my fans to stay calm. “I’m waiting for that right offer,team,project . I Love all TeamOGU…,” Ogu stated on his twitter handle. The Super Eagles midfielder is currently unattached to any club side yet, but he believes he can still get a job with an European club this season after leaving Israeli side, Hapoel Beer Sheva. He called it a day with the five-time Israeli champions after his contract ended last season. But the 31-year-old believes he can still get a club in Europe to sign him this summer before the transfer window closes. Recall that the midfielder was part of the Nigerian bronze medallist at the 2019  Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
