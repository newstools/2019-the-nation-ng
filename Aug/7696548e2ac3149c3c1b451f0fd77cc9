Enugu born rapper, Phyno, thrilled audience to a show-stopping performance in Enugu at the Hi-Life Fest semi-final. Phyno had earlier met with the Hi-Life Fest quarterfinalists to offer them some motivation during their time in Lagos. The crowd, as well as the Hi-Life Fest semi-finalists, were thrilled to have the talented rapper in their midst. His performance featured some of his chart-topping tunes like ‘The Bag’ and ‘Alobam.’ Following the performance, a guest in attendance who was seeing Phyno perform for the first time expressed her excitement. “I have heard a lot about his performance but this was better than everything I was told,” she said. “Phyno really shutdown the show today and I’m so glad to have witnessed it.” The Hi-Life Fest semi-finalists also put in an impressive shift and it was a tough decision to pick four out of the six contestants of the night. The four remaining contestants now have a 14-day window to prepare for the final in Onitsha, Anambra State. The grand finale of Hi-Life Fest will see the four remaining contestants go head to head, with the winner earning the grand sum of five million naira.
