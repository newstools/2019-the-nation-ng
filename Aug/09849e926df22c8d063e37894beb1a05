Fast rising artiste and song writer, Adeniyi Adewoyin, kmown as Neo Phlames in music circle has released a new song titled Nobody. Produced by German music producer, Paul Hauss and mixed by Mr Rodney, Nobody, according to the Oyo State born artiste is a love song that reaffirms ones love to their partner. “Like a hook in the song says, “Nobody fit take you away from me” it’s basically to say there’s nothing anyone can say or do to make me stop loving whoever I choose to love” said Neo Phlames. On how he got the instrumental from a German who makes Afrobeats he said, “actually when people heard the song they find it difficult to believe that a German produced the beat. “I saw a couple of his works on the internet and we had few discussion on working together. Paul Hauss is very good at what he does especially making Afrobeats which has taken over the music world in recent time.
I think Africa should watch out for this guy, he’s got some unusual good beats. “However, I still have one more song produced by him which I will release later in the year.” Nobody is however available on all musical platforms for streaming and downloading. Since his debut 2years ago, Neo Phlames has been up and doing dishikh out good music and has had his musical live shows tagged My Hood Live concert which held in Egbeda, Lagos last Easter.
