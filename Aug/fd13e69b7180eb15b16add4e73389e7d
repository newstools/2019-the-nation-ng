 Mario Balotelli is on the verge of sealing multi-million euros contract with Italia Seria A side Brescia. Fillers from the Italian capital indicate that it would be a matter of hours before the deal is officially announced. The deal it was further gathered should have come earlier but for insistence of Club President Massimo Cellino that the deal should not be announced earlier than August 18 SuperMario’s contract will be for three years, but broken down in a certain way. The club’s permanence in Serie A will play a decisive role in him staying long term. In fact, if they are relegated after this season Balotelli could break free. His contract will see him get paid 3 million euros gross in his first season, and in the event of salvation he will be paid another 3 million (still gross) for the second season. At that point a two year contract would kick in, where Mario can earn 6 million gross in the 3rd season, which would be about 4.5 million net. “The why always me” exponent who has played for Manchester City, Liverpool and Inter and AC  Milan among other clubs, joined current club Marseille early this year after terminating his contract with Nice. He has so far netted 8 goals for the side in 12 appearances.
