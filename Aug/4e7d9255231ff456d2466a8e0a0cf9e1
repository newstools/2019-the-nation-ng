Ex-agitators in the Niger Delta region are calling on the federal government to fulfill its promise to engage them with pipeline surveillance jobs. In a statement made available to The Nation, the former militants said their patience is wearing out, having waited on the presidency for three years to no avail. Urging the presidency, including the current amnesty boss, Professor Charles Dokubo and relevant security agencies to intervene, they called for the needful to be done. Speaking on behalf of the former militants, a leader of Peretorogbene Community in Bayelsa State, Comrade Bossman Abodedike, stated that the promise to engage the youths was reached during one of the peace meetings with former coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Brig. General Paul Boroh, held in the creeks. He revealed that the meeting, which was organised to persuade the “boys” to lay down their arms for smooth oil and gas operations, had relevant stakeholders and ex-agitators of the Niger Delta in attendance. Abodedike, while stressing that implementation of the said agreement has not been reached till date, quoted Brig. Boroh to have stated, “the Niger Delta is a serious concern to the Federal government, it was revealed in a security meeting. The intention of the federal administration is to engage our youths on pipeline surveillance job. Each community will be responsible for the provision of pipeline security in their community”. The community leader added that the youths across Niger Delta communities were told to submit names and passports to the Amnesty Coordinator’s Office in Abuja, for the proposed pipeline surveillance jobs. Calling on the vice president, Prof Yemi Osibanjo, Dokubo and other relevant authorities who have in time past ensured sustainable peace in the area to rise swiftly to the matter, he noted that the federal government’s assurance led to the cease fire and relative peace being enjoyed by oil and gas companies in the region.
