A 45-year-old man, Olufemi Godwin, has been arraigned at a Badagry Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court, Lagos, for alleged issuance of a dud cheque for N1.5 million. Godwin, whose address was not given, was arraigned on Wednesday on one- count charge, but he denied committing the offence. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Clement Okuoimose said Godwin committed the offence on July 14, at 11am, at Mr. Right Hotel on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. He alleged that the defendant issued a dud Diamond Bank cheque numbered 0041626039, for N1.5 million to Mr Gideon Oladipo.
