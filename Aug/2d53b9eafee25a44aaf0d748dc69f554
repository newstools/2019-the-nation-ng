Some of the aspirants for today’s governorship primary of the Kogi State All Progressives Congress (APC) have accused Governor Yahaya Bello of trying to manipulate the list of delegates for the primary election. Sources close to some of the aspirants told The Nation that they have information that the governor was working with some unnamed officials at the party’s national secretariat to alter the delegates’ list because of fears that some of them may not vote for him. According to the APC electoral guidelines for the conduct of indirect primaries, only officials of the party from the ward, local government and state constitute delegates for the primary election scheduled to hold in Lokoja today. Aside the party officials who constitute delegates, there are also statutory delegates made up of members of the state and National Assembly as well as national officials from the state. The source showed The Nation a document they obtained from INEC which was supposedly transmitted to the commission on July 24, containing names of the delegates for the primary. The source said: “Bello is afraid that more aspirants have been cleared to contest against him. He is no longer comfortable and so he is doing everything he can to manipulate the list of delegates and import names into the list.” The source asked the party’s national leadership y to allow a level-playing ground for all aspirants. There are 239 wards within the 21 local government areas of Kogi State and executive members of the parry in these wards and local government and state officials are delegates to the primary.
