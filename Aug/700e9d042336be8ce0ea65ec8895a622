Acting chairman, Cocoa Board in Cross River State, Mr. Oscar Ofuka, says the government has set up a task force to recover over N700m owed by cocoa farmers in the last four years. He told reporters in Calabar on Monday that it was worrisome that cocoa farmers had refused to pay for lands allotted to them for farming. “It is unfortunate that people take up the farms, harvest the produce and walk away with the proceeds without paying the contract sum. “This is bad, especially now that the state government is looking for money to regenerate and rehabilitate the farms which have become moribund. The farmers who have been working in the farms have not paid for four years. “State government is no longer going to take it lightly with those defaulting. Those in charge of the farms have cheated government in the last four years,” Ofuka said. He warned small-holder farmers and contractors owing the government to vacate the farms or risk prosecution. He said the government had constituted a task force in collaboration with landlord communities to assist the board recover debt owed the state government to enable the state government to pay royalty to the host communities.
