A legal practitioner, Lolade Johnson, accused of defrauding an accommodation seeker of N1.2 million yesterday appeared before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Johnson, 49, was arraigned by the police on a four-count charge of fraud, stealing, malicious damage and breach of the peace, before Mr O.O. Olatunji. Prosecuting Inspector Oladele Adebayo alleged that the defendant committed the offence in July 2017 at 7, Ondo Street, Apapa Road, Ebute-Meta. Adebayo said the defendant obtained N1.2m from the complainant, Mr. Ayo Ayeni, for a two-bedroom flat. The court heard that she collected the money but refused to provide the keys to the apartment. She also allegedly maliciously damaged the two padlocks the complainant used in locking the apartment. According to the prosecutor, the defendant also issued a “false Letter of Authority” to take over the flat from the complainant. The offence, he said, contravened sections 168, 287, 314 and 350 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Olatunji admitted the defendant to bail on self-recognizance. He ordered the defendant to deposit her Call to Bar Certificate and adjourned further proceedings till September 30.
