The House of Representatives joint Committees on Healthcare Services and Health Institutions convened a meeting on Tuesday with the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) with the intent of stopping the proposed strike by the organisation. Present at the meeting were the Ministry of Health, The Budget Office,. Ministry of Finance, the Nigerian Medical Association and Committee of Chief Medical Directors and Medical Directors (CCMDs/MDs) amongst others. The Chairman of the House Committee on Healthcare Services,Yusuf Tanko Sununu, while speaking said the meeting was a continuation of that called by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila on the 29th July in a bid to stop the proposed strike by the Doctors. He said: “There were three issues in contention at that meeting: One is the issue of shortfall of salary that amounted to N3.5 billion, which is to be paid to Doctors practising in the country. ” I think that has been successfully resolved as both Budget Office and Ministry of Finance clearly told us that a provision was made to ensure that within this month, at least that will be paid. “Secondly, we also have issue of skipping areas totalling about N23 billion, which was strongly debated. Mr. Speaker is of the view, as at the conclusion of that meeting, that the claim is a genuine one. Because all evidence before the meeting as at that date shows that Federal Government, through the agency of Federal Ministry of Health has gone into agreement to pay these skipping arrears. These are all the available documents that was tendered to the Committee… Meeting still ongoing…  Details shortly…
