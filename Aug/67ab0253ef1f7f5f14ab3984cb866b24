Fans of BBNaija show have taken to Twitter to show appreciation of the play performed by the housemates on Wednesday. The Pepper Dem housemates, courtesy of Heritage Bank, staged a coronation ceremony of the Tor Tiv Seyi. See some of the reactions below: Seyi and Tacha have the best suspense this season. Literally, there's is this part of my heart that wants to see where their friendship will lead to and there's another part that wants it to just stop cos they are both giving me high blood pressure.

Thumbs up to the #TorTiv himself Kingseyi, Sir Dee, and Frodd. They played their role excellently. Cindy and Khafi too were great in their roles.
