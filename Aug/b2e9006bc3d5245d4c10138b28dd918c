Residents of Ashamu Estate in Isolo, Lagos have petitioned the police over the demolition of their house by hoodlums from Mushin. They alleged that the incident, which occurred on July 21, could disrupt peace. An agent, Alhaji Teslim Almaroof, acting on behalf of the estate administrators, said the residents would take legal steps to proptect their properties. The petition, signed by Olumide Oyewole, reads “Our client is the accredited agent of the administrators of the estate of the late Chief Emmanuel Oyedele Ashamu, having been solely appointed by virtue of the agency agreement dated September 26, 1995. “The late Ashamu is the owner of the vast area of land at Ashamu Estate and covered under the judgment of the Supreme Court dated November 4, 1986 in appeal number SC43/1986; and the Court of Appeal judgment dated July 16, 1985 in appeal number CA/L/111/84. “Since the demise of Chief Ashamu on August 20, 1992, the following people were appointed the legal administrators of his estate: Mrs. Mary Oyedoyin Bandoh, Miss Jadesola Ashamu and Miss Titi Ashamu; and therefore, entitled and permitted by law to take decisions on behalf of the beneficiaries of the estate.” Almaroof, the petition said, had been managing the estate since his appointment in 1995. It alleged that part  of the land had been alienated by third parties. “Our client informed us that on July 21, some hoodlums from Mushin, moved to the estate and began to demolish structures belonging to other people and threatened the lives of anyone who attempted to stop them. Our client also told us that these elements promised to deal ruthlessly with him and his workers should they go near the land. “Sir, there is pandemonium in the community, and except the police intervene, there is likelihood of complete breakdown of law and order in the area,” Oyewole said.
