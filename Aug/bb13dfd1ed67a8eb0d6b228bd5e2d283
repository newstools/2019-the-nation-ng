THE Lagos State government has stepped up efforts to register children as soon as they are born even as it has been mandated by the National Population Commission (NPoPC) to register one million children by the end of the year. With a total of 231,584 registrations comprising 117,586 boys and 113,998 girls, Lagos had the second highest number of birth registrations in the country in 2018 after Borno State. Speaking at a 2-day workshop organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA) in collaboration with UNICEF on the need to scale up birth registration in Lagos State, a Child Protection Specialist, UNICEF, Mrs. Sharon Oladiji, pointed out that birth registration is the first step towards recognising a child’s inalienable right as a human being, but in Lagos State this is failing to meet their right to an identity, name and nationality. Oladiji, who decried the threat to the rights of over 1.4 million children in the state, also called for expansion of birth registration services in all LGAs with prioritisation of interventions to accelerate progress, especially amongst the poor in rural areas and among socially- disadvantaged groups. The Lagos State 2019 report so far shows that the worst-performing Local Government Areas (LGAs) are Epe with 28,817 registrations, Lagos Island 28,579 registrations, and Ibeju- Lekki with 18,346 registrations. On his part, Lagos State Director, National Orientation Agency, NOA, Mr. Waheed Ishola, who noted that the media was critical in the scaling up of birth registration, appealed to media practitioners to buy into the programme and help create awareness on the project. “When a child is not registered, there is no official record of his/her full name and that child will not have access to basic services,” said the Head of Department, Vital Registration Department, National Population Commission, NPoPC Lagos State, Mr. Nwannukwu Ikechukwu.
