Edo State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Abubakar, has said the forest clearing done at hotspots along the Benin-Ore highway has helped to curb kidnapping and robbery previously experienced on the road. Abubakar, who addressed reporters on Wednesday in Benin City, said other security strategies also put in place have made the criminals to flee. He said no kidnapping has occurred on the Benin-Ore road since the forest was cleared. The police boss said he took the battle to the hoodlums because the Benin-Ore highway is too strategic for hoodlums to be allowed to operate. He said: “I, as Commissioner of Police in Edo, will not sit back and allow hoodlums take over the Benin highway. “That was why we mobilised ourselves and went after them. We have followed and engaged them in shootout and rescued several persons from them. “We discovered that they have an added advantage over us, which is the forest that is closer to the road. We met with the state government to support us to clear the bush. Governor Godwin Obaseki provided the support and cleared the forest. Since we cleared the forest, they have run away. We also carried out bush combing, destroying a lot of camps. The hoodlums and kidnappers have relocated from Edo State. For the past two weeks there is nothing like kidnapping along the highway. The exercise is ongoing and we are going to sustain it. We will ensure that travellers are safe. “We have over 20 checkpoints and there are senior officers saddled with supervision. There is another patrol team going round the clock. We have other security measures. Edo is a no-go area for criminals.”
