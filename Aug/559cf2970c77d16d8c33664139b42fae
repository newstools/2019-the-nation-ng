HOW do you interpret this: a local government council office charging law-abiding citizens, driving there for legitimate business, for parking space? Shouldn’t a council have a parking lot?  Is not having one a legit way to raise revenue?  Or a brazen effort to extort the very citizens that voted the council chair and his councillors to office? Lagos Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu must hear this! It was about 9 am on Friday, August 9.  Some workers at the FRSC office, at the Itire Area Office, Mushin Local Government, off the Cele Bus stop, on the Mile 2-Oshodi Expressway, had alerted Hardball that his renewed driver’s licence might be ready for pick-up. So, to that office Hardball drove, only to be stopped at the gate, by some council(?) officials.  What for?  You could not enter the yard, they claimed, until you pay a parking fee of N200! They pointed at a small banner hung on the gate: “Car Park: for a Trip — Pay & Park”, the banner announced, with the full complement of the council’s logo. In the ensuing exchange, one of the officials, a female, politely explained that the council had firmed the park-and-pay business to a private operator. After much resistance, some gruff, thuggish and loutish-looking fellows boasted to puncture the tyre of anyone that entered the council yard without paying the new levy.  Eventually, they prevailed, thereafter issuing an analogue receipt for N200. Now, is this legit revenue raising?  Or unconscionable extortion of citizens, suggesting deep contempt for the same people that voted the council officials into office? That is the question begging for the governor’s attention.
