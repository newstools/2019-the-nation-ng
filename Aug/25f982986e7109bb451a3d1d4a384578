An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday remanded a housekeeper, Mercy Edeh, following her arraignment for allegedly defiling her employer’s four-year-old daughter. Magistrate K. O. Doja-Ojo ordered that Edeh be kept in Ikoyi Prison. She said the case file should be duplicated and sent to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. She did not take the defendant’s plea; she advised her to apply for bail at a high court. The police brought Edeh, 26, before the court on a temporary two-count charge of indecent assault and defilement. Prosecuting Inspector Peace Chukwudi said the defendant committed the offence on August 1, at Chevron Drive, Ajah Lagos. Edeh was said to have penetrated the child with her finger. “The defendant indecently assaulted the four-year-old,” the prosecutor alleged. The case continues on September 11.
