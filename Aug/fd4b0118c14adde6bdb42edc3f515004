RESIDENTS in Auchi, headquarters of Estako West Local Government of Edo State are protesting suspension of the council Chairman, Yakubu Musa, popularly known as Yakson. The protesters blocked entrance to the secretariat to prevent workers from resuming duties. They stormed streets with placards, bearing inscriptions, such as “Yakson is prudent”; “Estako people say no to oppression.” Some protesters linked the suspension to the supremacy battle between Governor Godwin Obaseki and Adams Oshiomhole. They said Yakson was removed following his closeness to Oshiomhole. It was claimed  that Yakson was suspended because he uncovered fraud in the payroll perpetrated by powerful individuals and reported to the authorities. But the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Monday Osaigbovo, described the protest as unfortunate. He said the protest was uncalled for except the people do not want development. Osaigbovo said the suspension was not connected to the quarrel between Oshiomhole and Obaseki, but that the governor uncovered salary fraud. The commissionner said: “It was discovered that salaries were going up every month when new workers were not employed. ‘’The ICT discovered that over 80 ghost workers were receiving N6 million monthly. Another N46 million fraud was uncovered and the governor had to suspend the chairman for two months, to allow diligent investigation. It is not true that the chairman reported any fraud; it was the governor who uncovered the fraud.”
