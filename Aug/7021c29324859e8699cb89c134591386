MOLPED Sanitary Pads from the stable of Hayat Kimya Nigeria Limitied has celebrated the world friendship day  with the launch of ‘Mo Girls’, a party of 40 beautiful girls. The ‘Mo Girls’ meet, which held in Lagos, enlightened girls on benefits of love and helping one another. Brand Manager (Sanitary Pad Category), Onyinyechi Nwosu, explained that the launch of the hangout was the beginning for the brand and the ladys to form that much needed bond, which is friendship and companionship. She also spoke on the benefits of the pad, noting that it offers solution to irritation and roughness, as it is produced  with nylon free materials  and a breathable back sheet. This, according to her, helps to eliminate the burning sensation while in use and provide comfort. A General Health Specialist, Dr. Doyin Olaosibikan, who spoke at the event, underscored the health benefits of the sanitary pads mostly especially in absorbing even heavy flows. Twenty-eight-year-old singer and songwriter, popularly known as Chidinma, maintained that MOLPED was all about friendship, which is like a bridge that connects the community of girls the brand is building.
