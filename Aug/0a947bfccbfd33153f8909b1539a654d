Young cocoa farmers in Osun State have appealed to government at state and federal levels to support them with funds and tools to enable them do well in their agribusiness. They made the appeal at Iperindo, an agrarian community in Osun State where they celebrated the International Youth Day under the auspices of Olam Cocoa with support from Action Health Incorporated (AHI) The Programme Officer of Action Health Incorporated, Tina Igbinedion expressed concern on the future of agriculture given the way rural areas are losing a vital part of their workforce as young people were migrating to cities or abroad. She said: “Agriculture remains a significant employer of labour and can contribute to a significant reduction of unemployment among young people in Nigeria.” During the event, the young cocoa farmers were sensitized on healthy living. They also received free medical checkup and treatment. They were also thought the modern best practices in cocoa production so as to make commensurate profits. Igbinedion said diversification into agriculture is an important mechanism for economic growth.
