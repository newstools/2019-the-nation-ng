Indigenes of Ijebu-Isiwo community in Ijebu-Ode local government area of Ogun State have embarked on communal effort to rehabilitate the eight-kilometre potholed road leading to the town. An initiative of indigenes at home and in the Diaspora, they have raised millions of naira to make the road motorable for the natives in preparation for the Ileya festival and the town’s Ojude Oba  ceremony that attracts all indigenes irrespective of religious belief. Championed by the Oluomo of Ijebu-Isiwo, Otunba Tunji Ilelaboye, work on the road had taken three intensive weeks for completion. The traditional ruler of the town, Lamodi of Ijebu-Isiwo, Oba Adedoyin Salisu, had commended efforts of the people in rallying for the execution of the project. He particularly commended the indigenes in the Diaspora for their financial contribution, pointing out that it is heart warming that in spite of their comfort zones abroad, they remembered their roots. Successive governments of Ogun State have pledged to tar the road leading to the town, which is a border community with Epe in Lagos State but have failed to redeem such pledges. A community  leader, Dr. Bisi Olawunmi, chairman of Aiyegbami-Isiwo Community Development Association,  however,  expressed optimism  about government’s attention to the road with the new administration of  Govenor Dapo Abiodun publicly acknowledging the strategic importance of the Epe-Ijebu-Ode road as a major artery to boost development in that corridor of the state.
