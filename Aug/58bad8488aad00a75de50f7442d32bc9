Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) has expressed its willingness to assist the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) workers to own houses in Abuja and environs. FMBN Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) Ahmed Dangiwa gave the assurance when  NITDA Director-General (DG), Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, and some officers of the agency paid a courtesy call on the bank in Abuja. This was in response to a request by the NITDA chief on the FMBN to support the agency’s staff members  to get housing loans. He said part of the bank’s focus was to strengthen  the partnership with its stakeholders. He said the bank deals many  stakeholders, such as the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) to deliver over 100 houses in every state. He, therefore, urged NITDA to, also, avail itself of the bank’s mortgage products. “We will designate a desk officer who will liaise with your organisation to further guide you on how to access these products and services,” Dangiwa said. He expressed FMBN’s gratitude to the agency for  granting the bank certification for the procurement and deployment of its core banking application, saying it would consolidate the bank’s effort in its automation. Earlier, Pantami said the agency’s mission to the bank was to improve relationship between the two institutions. He said: “I know if you want your staff to do well, you have to take care of them.” Pantami said NITDA was established to implement the national IT policy and serve as a clearing house for all government institutions, set up a committee to look into how its staff could get affordable accommodation in Abuja. He explained that housing was one of the main challenges of staff members of the agency, which he wanted FMBN to help solve.
