LOW purchasing power seems to be hindering traders from buying insurance policies that can protect their business, findings by The Nation  has shown. Some of the traders, however, said they buy third party motor insurance because, according to them, it is compulsory for them to have it. The Nation visited some markets to ascertain the level of insurance awareness. A spare part dealer at Ladipo Market, Mushin, Lagos, Mr Anieke Levi said he was aware of that he needed insurance for his business. He urged insurance firms to make the policies affordable for market men and women. He said while he had not bought any insurance policy, his car is insured. He noted that he bought motor insurance so that the police and vehicle inspection officers would not seize his vehicle driving on the road. Another trader, Valentine Anierobi said he could not afford to buy insurance. ‘’I struggle every day to make a living. Is it possible for me to buy insurance after struggling to make little money? Maybe, I will think of insurance when I am able to feed and clothe myself well,’’ he said. Mrs. Blessing Nweago does not believe in insurance. ‘’My business is okay, it doesn’t need insurance,’’ she said.
