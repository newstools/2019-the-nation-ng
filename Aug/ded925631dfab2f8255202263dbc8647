An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos yesterday remanded in prison custody a man, David Okotie, who allegedly raped an 11-year-old girl. Chief Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat made the order following an application by the police. Sule-Amzat, who did not take Okotie’s plea, remanded Okotie in Kirikiri Prison and ordered the police to send the case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. Prosecution counsel Benson Emuerhi, who made the application, alleged that Okotie, who lives off Highway Patrol Barrack, Ikeja, Lagos, committed the offence on January 15. The court heard that the case was reported by the girl’s mother at the Gender Section, Ikeja Police Command. Emuerhi, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), said the offence infringed Section 137 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Sule-Amzat adjourned further proceedings till October 31.
