The Ondo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday vowed to retain power in the state in next year’s governorship election. The party said “the indicators are unambiguous”. The party said Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) is leading a government that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of the people. The party said in a statement by its spokesman, Alex Kalejaiye, that” we harbour no doubts that God is happy with the APC-led government and the people are rejoicing”. It said contrary to speculative analyses, the Ondo State APC is neither dying nor growing weak. The State Executive, the statement added, was not factionalised and disenchanted with a government that has made the party proud, and created an atmosphere of confidence and trust between the government and the governed. It added: ” the State Working Committee (SWC), is deeply preoccupied with its continuous duty of ensuring, and sustaining oneness and unity of members without prejudice. The SWC has no regards for camps or groups. “The APC-led government has never slacked in the construction of quality roads, provision of portable water, massive investment in Agriculture and the health sector, creation of industrial hub in the State. All these are being done without compromising on the welfare and morale of the engine-room of government. “It is germane to state emphatically that no serious-minded government, that is determined to make indelible marks, can jettison the above activities for weekly empowerment’’. “APC appreciated the untainted efforts and sacrifices of leaders that are forward-looking on matters of concern to the State chapter.”
