Ondo State Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi on Sunday denied the report that he wanted to dump the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the rival Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to contest the next year’s governorship election. Besides, he said he never thought of contesting against his boss, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, stressing that the reports were the handiwork of attention-seekers, who are well-known within the state’s political circle. A statement by his spokesman Babatope Okeowo said: “This is a blatant falsehood as Agboola Ajayi remains a bonafide member of the APC and has no plan to dump the party for any rival political party. “There is no place where the deputy governor has met with stalwarts of the PDP, not to talk of dividing their party.” The deputy governor also used the medium to apologise to Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, whose name was dragged into the murky water of Ondo State politics as being the sponsor of his alleged plan to contest on the PDP’s platform. The statement emphasized: “Ajayi remains as the deputy governor and loyal to his boss. He was chosen as the deputy governor at the benevolent of his boss, Akeredolu. This is to say emphatically that Ajayi has no intention to contest against him. “We know the plan of the sponsors of the story is to cause a serious rift between Governor Akeredolu and his deputy for their selfish reasons. “It must be noted that Ajayi is a seasoned politician, who knows the limitation of his office as the deputy governor. He is not ready in any way to rock the boat of the progress of this administration. “This is another grand plan by the busybodies and professional blackmailers to create division within the ranks of the ruling APC in Ondo State in order to create advantage, which does not exist anywhere.”
