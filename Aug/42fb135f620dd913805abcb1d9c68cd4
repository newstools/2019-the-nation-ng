Former Nigeria international Victor Moses risks losing his starting spot at Fenerbahce in the new season. Turkish sports daily Fanatik has suggested that the Chelsea-owned winger was a shadow of himself during the preparatory matches and Deniz Türuc is now ahead of the Nigerian in manager Ersun Yanal’s pecking order of right-wingers. Former Netherlands U20 international Turuc joined Fenerbahce on a three-year deal from Kayserispor on August 3. It is claimed by the newspaper that when Rodrigues and Moses played on the wings, the quality of the attack line decreased and Turuc has sparkled in training sessions. In the second half of last season, the new Fenerbahce number 11 appeared in 16 matches, including ten starts. Moses has netted only one goal so far in pre-season against Boluspor on July 13.
