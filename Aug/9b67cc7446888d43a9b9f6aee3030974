Nigerian equities reopened yesterday to a streak of bargain-hunting as investors sought to take advantage of the steep depreciation in share prices in recent days. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated average gain of 0.71 per cent yesterday, equivalent to net capital gains of N93 billion. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks share prices at the NSE, appreciated from its opening index of 26,925.29 points to close at 27,115.89 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also improved from opening value of N13.121 trillion to close at N13.214 trillion. The negative average year-to-date return improved to -13.73 per cent. With 20 advancers against 13 decliners, the positive overall market position was driven by widespread bargain-hunting transactions, especially within the large and mid-cap stocks. Sectoral indices however showed mixed performance as losses by some large-cap stocks weighed down many indices. The NSE Banking Index appreciated by 1.34 per cent while the NSE Oil & Gas Index rose by 0.59 per cent. However, the NSE Insurance Index depreciated by 2.41 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index declined by 1.59 per cent while the NSE Industrials Goods Index dipped by 0.25 per cent.
