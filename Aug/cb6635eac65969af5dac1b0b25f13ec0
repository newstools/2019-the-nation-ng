A businessman, Lateef Badmus, has approached a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, Oyo State, seeking the dissolution of his 4-year-old marriage, on grounds that his wife, Munirat, was ”arrogant and full of herself”. Badmus said:”My wife is disrespectful. I have endured all sorts of embarrassment and insults from Munirat for four years.’ ”Munirat will insult and disrespect anybody. I am not willing to continue with her. She disrespects my parents”, he said. However, Munirat, denied all the allegations leveled against her. She argued that she had remained loyal, obedient and loving to her husband and his family members. “I visit my in-law and even cook their food. Please for the sake of our child, do not separate us,” Munirat pleaded. Delivering his ruling, Mr Ademola Odunade, the President the court, dissolved the marriage. Odunade held that there was no way an arrogant wife can find favour with her spouse and his relatives and therefore, dissolved the union in the interest of peace. The arbitrator, however, awarded custody of the only child to Munirat and ordered Badmus to pay N5,000 monthly for the child’s upkeep in addition to being responsible for her education. (NAN)
