Senator Oluremi Tinubu has inaugurated a drainage system at Coker-Aguda Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State. The Lagos Central Senator said God used her to attract the project, which was approved by the Eighth Senate, to the community. She, however, noted that it was not the duty of National Assembly members to execute infrastructural projects, but that of the executive. The duty of lawmakers, she said, was to make laws and oversight projects. “Lawmakers, however, took on the added function of embarking on constituency projects to meet the expectations of the people,” she said. Senator Tinubu urged the Federal Government to support the state with projects, as its population keeps growing. She enjoined the residents not to dump refuse inside the drainage. The government, the senator said, was mindful of their welfare, adding that it would do everything to address it. She asked Coker-Aguda LCDA Chairman Mrs. Omobanle Akinyemi-Obe for the list of schools in the area that needed toilets to enable her address the issue. Akinyemi-Obe thanked Senator Tinubu for making the project a reality. She said the lawmaker always responded to people’s needs. The residents hailed the senator for attracting the two-side open project to their area, saying it would tackle flood.
