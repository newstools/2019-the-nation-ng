HENRY Onyekuru has finally arrived in France to sign a five-year contract with AS Monaco subject to passing a routine medical. Onyekuru whose arrival in France was delayed by a visa hitch will be presented to the media today. SCORENigeria first reported that Monaco and Onyekuru’s parent club Everton has agreed a 15 million Euros transfer for the Super Eagles’ winger. This was after Everton’s application for a work permit for the player was not granted by the British Home Office. ‘Prince of Monaco’ Victor Ikpeba was the most successful Nigerian star at the Principality club where he won the French Ligue 1 and was crowned CAF African Player of the Year in 1997. The likes of Sani Kaita and Lukman Haruna have also featured for Monaco.
