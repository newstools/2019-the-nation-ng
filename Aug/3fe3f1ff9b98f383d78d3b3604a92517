The worsening insecurity in the land is not good news for investment, the Founder, President and Chairman of Cocharis Group, Dr. Cosmas Maduka, said on Friday. The popular businessman spoke at The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM),Vision House, Utako, Abuja, during its Leading Edge Conference with the theme: From mourning to dancing. Maduka, who is also a renowned philanthropist, noted that vices, such as kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and other elements of insecurity plaguing the country were chasing investors away from the country. He said: “Obviously, the environment is not right. There’s no need to fool ourselves. Government has a lot to do to create confidence. “Talking about investors, these are people who have already made money: they’re capitalists. But nobody loves money more than his life. “When you’re coming from the airport and somebody with two AK47 rifles is escorting you, you know you’re going to the war front. Have you seen people going to make investment at the war front? “So, we need to fix this country and get to a level of confidence where true investors will come. People who are coming now have something to take out; they don’t have a five or 10-year plan.”
