The fraudster reportedly duped business man in the commercial city of the state of N3million. Divisional Police Officer Rabiu Garba disclosed this on Sunday in Fegge while briefing newsmen on the efforts of his division to sanitise the area. He said over N2million have so far been recovered from the suspect while efforts were on to recover the remaining amount. He said the suspect was assisting the police in their investigations. The DPO also raised the alarm over a new method developed by the fraudsters in defrauding their victims at ATM Bank point through exchange of ATM cards while pretending to assist the customer. He said others send fake bank alert to their victims after deceiving them. He added, “Detectives from my division have also arrested a syndicate who duped a building material dealer of N1.2million worth of goods relocated to Ukpor, Nnewi South LGA of the state.” He regretted that cyber crime in and around the commercial city has assumed an endemic dimension. While revealing that the division has embarked on a search on all flash point and Betnaija offices, Rabiu warned that under aged children caught patronising such outfit would be arrested. He appealed to parents and guardians to always keep watch on their children and wards.
