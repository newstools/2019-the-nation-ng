Bayern Munich were frustrated in their opening Bundesliga match of the campaign as Hertha Berlin held them to a 2-2 draw. Lewandowski’s 24th-minute goal put Niko Kovac’s side, who are set to sign Barcelona’s Philippe Coutinho on loan, ahead on Friday but Hertha turned the game on its head in the space of two minutes. Dodi Lukebakio’s fortunate strike restored parity in the 36th minute before Marko Grujic capitalised on sloppy Bayern defending. Grujic turned from Hertha’s hero to villain just prior to the hour, however, when his needless foul on Lewandowski was spotted by VAR but, although Bayern’s striker tucked in the resulting penalty, the hosts could not carve out a winner. Kovac and his men have been heavy scrutiny last season but his side ended 2018-19 in sensational form, going unbeaten in their final 14 Bundesliga matches as they snatched the league title ahead of Borussia Dortmund with two points and then won the DFB-Pokal. But, having recently lost to Dortmund in the DFL-Supercup, Bayern know that even the goals of Lewandowski and imminent arrival of Coutinho may not be enough to hold off Lucien Favre’s side for a second season running. Bayern will travel to Schalke on August 24 in what is David Wagner’s first home game in charge of his new club, while Hertha host Wolfsburg in their next match.
