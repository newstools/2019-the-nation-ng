ENYIMBA has said they are confident they can overturn a 1-0 loss at Rahimo of Burkina Faso to advance to the first round of the CAF Champions League. Rahimo recorded the match-winner after half an hour when danger man Zanon dribbled into the box before his shot took a wicked deflection off Ifeanyi Anaemena and into the net. However, Coach Usman Abdalla said he was confident Enyimba could turn the tables in Aba in a fortnight. “The goal came in with a deflection. We could have saved that goal but now we have to go back to Aba and cancel the goal and have to get another one more goal to seal the deal,” he said. “It’s not a good result for us, but at the same time it’s not catastrophic because if we had lost by two goals or three then it would be a difficult situation. “As you know we are all starting and results are always this way until we get ourselves into the the competition where we get much fitter.” He praised the fitness of the Burkinabes. “They have a youthful and young team with very good mobility and good techniques and they are very fit,” he remarked. “We’ve seen the team now so the most important thing is to go back, sit down and work with what we’ve seen of the team.”
