TWO women have been arrested for allegedly stealing N400,000 from a woman at Nkwelle Ezunaka in Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State. The suspects with their accomplices allegedly robbed their victim, Nwanye Philomina, after picking her around Nteje area of the town. The Nation gathered that the victim had ignorantly boarded a vehicle heading for Onitsha when she was attacked. A police source said the syndicate, who saw the money in the victim’s bag, suddenly stopped and requested she should come down, claiming they wanted to adjust her seat. “Oblivious of their plan, the victim came down and immediately the hoodlums sped off with her bag containing N400,000,” the source added. Confirming the incident, police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said the suspects were arrested by the patrol team attached to 3-3 Division. He gave their names as Cynthia Agu, 20, and Mary Andrew, 20 both from Enugu State, as well as Collins Okoli, 33, and Friday Ebim, 41, both from Delta State. Mohammed said: “At about 2pm, Nwanye Philomina, aged 30, from Akwuzu, boarded a taxi at Nteje Boys High School bus stop in Oyi Local Government. “When the vehicle got to Nkwelle Ezunaka, the syndicate suddenly stopped and asked her to come down to enable them adjust the seat, but they sped off. “The victim immediately raised the alarm, which attracted the attention of some motorists, who pursued the suspects to Nkwelle community where a police patrol team attached to 3-3 Division intercepted and arrested them.” The spokesman said the suspects were nearly lynched by a mob, but for the quick intervention of the police. He added that the money was recovered, while the vehicle used in perpetrating the act was impounded. Mohammed said the suspects would be arraigned after investigations.
