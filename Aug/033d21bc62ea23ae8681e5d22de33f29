A new food company, Augustsecrets has held its first kids fair. The aim of the fair was to showcase its new products, as well as create an avenue for fun and entertainment for families to mingle. The event, held at Bay Lounge, Lekki, Lagos, witnessed attendance of a number of guests and their kids, who registered using number identity tags before the event. Speaking at the event, the brand’s founder, Mrs Toyin Onigbanjo who is passionate about helping Nigerian mothers feed their babies with healthier meals from home-grown foods like vegetables, grains and tubers said she understands the sacrifices parents make for their children’s comfort and well-being “which is as it should be, but I also want parents to sit back and enjoy their time when they can. The sole purpose of this fair, aside from the food exhibition and sales, was really to give parents the opportunity to just relax and enjoy themselves.” Known as the Jaden’s Brand series, the meals named after her son, Jaden, who is the inspiration behind the brand includes Mixagrain, Fossy pops, Veggie beans, Fruitamil, Nutty meal and Crayfish powder. To teach parents present how to prepare the meals, a mini kitchen was set-up to aid the cooking workshop session. In this area, parents and guardians were educated on the fast and effective way of preparing the brand’s meals which helps save time without losing the nutrients contained in the meals.
