Members of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in Akwa Ibom have drawn the battle line with the state chairman, Obong Paul Ekpo, over his failure to deliver N2.6 billion contract to ward chapters of the party. It was gathered that Governor Udom Emmanuel had during his electioneering campaigns promised to award contracts to members at the ward levels. Piqued by the failure of the party to implement the Governor’s promise, members of the party across the wards on Wednesday booed Ekpo during a stakeholders meeting of the party. It was gathered that the party had promised “ward contract” to the people of the party before the re-election of the Governor. Sources in the party disclosed that each of the 329 wards was to be awarded the contract of N8 million, making a total of 2.6b for all the wards. The sources also revealed that some of the wards were given N2 million before the general elections while others received nothing. Emmanuel has vowed to speedily implement all the earlier decisions the party had with wards in the state. Emmanuel said it was not wrong for the people to speak up as that has helped him to know that all is not well with the people. He said: “If I don’t do this, do not believe whatever I will say again.”
