Dina Meshref continued her dominance in the continent as the defending champion retained her title with a convincing win over Yousra Helmy in the final of the women’s singles. Assar, who is the tournament’s no.3 seed, in the semi-final stage accounted for the host nation’s favourite, Quadri, the top seed (11-6, 11-8, 8-11, 11-7, 11-3), prior to overcoming  Saleh, the no.2 seed (10-12, 11-3, 11-6, 12-14, 11-3, 9-11, 11-3), the winner as far back as 1997 when the second edition of the tournament was staged in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Quadri finished in third place; in the play-off contest, he accounted for Algeria’s Sami Kherouf, the no.8 seed (11-6, 12-10, 11-5), the penultimate round victim of  Saleh (11-7, 11-6, 7-11, 11-4, 6-11, 11-2).
