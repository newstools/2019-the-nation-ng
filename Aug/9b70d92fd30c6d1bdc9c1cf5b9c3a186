 Super Eagles and Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is looking forward to seeing more Nigerian young players effectively combine football with academics. Ndidi who recently enrolled with De Montfort University (DMU) in Leicester City to study Business Management said the study will put him in better position to help young Nigerians who are ready to joggle football career with academics. The former Genk ace expressed delight at finally getting the opportunity to pursue a management course without affecting his playing career. “I was really happy when DMU staff said I could study here,” he said. “I wanted to do this course because growing up in Nigeria we didn’t really have the opportunity to actually go to school “It’s a personal thing for me that I want to do, to expand myself and learn new things,” he said in an interview with the school. The school enrollment according to the 22 year old who has become a must play at the King Power Stadium expressed satisfaction with the cooperation he is getting from the teaching staff of the institution, while noting that his enrollment has given room for  more fruitful use of his spare time. “Instead of sitting at home after training I come to DMU for my classes. The teachers have been amazing; they really try and help me understand. Rather than just reading books they take time to explain things to me and they very well understand my training Schedule,” he enthused Leicester City, face Sheffield United away on Saturday. Ndidi who scored a 67th minute goal in the Foxes’ recent 1-1 draw away to Stamford Bridge will be hoping to re-enact the feat when they face Sheffield United at the Bramall Lane.
