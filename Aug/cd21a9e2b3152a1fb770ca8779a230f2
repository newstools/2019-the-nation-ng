A businessman, Chibuike Amadi, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly collecting handbags worth N2.16 million from a Chinese, under the false pretence that he would pay her after sales. Amadi, 28, who lives at 11, Akiosun Street, Ijesha, Lagos, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money under false pretence. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Sergeant Mishozumu Samuel said the defendant committed the offences on March 26 and April 26 in Agege, Lagos. He alleged that the accused collected the handbags from the complainant, Mrs. Linling, (a Chinese), with a promise to pay her after he would have sold them. The prosecutor said the defendant knew that he was making a representation he knew was false. He said the defendant, who did not pay the money, also failed to return the goods to its owner. Magistrate O. D. Njoku admitted the defendant to N300, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on August 28.
