Axxela Limited has been chosen as ‘the Midstream Company of the Year’ and its Chief Executive Officer, Bolaji Osunsanya, as the ‘Innovative CEO of The Year’ at the 2019 Nigerian Business Leadership Awards. Accepting the award, Axxela CEO, Bolaji Osunsanya, dedicated both awards to the company’s employees. He said: “These awards validate our continuous drive to deliver value-adding energy solutions to our clients across West Africa, and our unwavering commitment to facilitate sustainable economic development in our chosen markets. Every day, our people bring unrivalled professionalism, partnership and excellence to our business enterprise, and I dedicate these awards to everyone at Axxela, and say a big thank you to BusinessDay, organiser of the Nigerian Business Leadership Awards, for recognising our efforts within the industry and across Nigeria.” Instituted to celebrate exceptional business leaders and organisations for their sustained commitment to excellence in enterprise and contributions to the economy, the Nigerian Business Leadership Awards are divided into two different categories: the global awards and sectoral awards. The global awards are bestowed on exceptional individuals whose performance and impact transcends specific industries, while the sectoral awards recognised companies that demonstrate impeccable business agility, market share growth, financial strength, leadership vision, and resilience in varying economic conditions. This year, Axxela became the first organisation in the Nigerian oil and gas industry to successfully achieve a trifecta certification of Integrated Management Systems: ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018. Axxela was also adjudged as the ‘Most Supportive Private Sector Organisation’ by the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) during the launch of its 2019 tree planting initiative, in recognition of its steadfast commitment towards a green and healthy environment.
