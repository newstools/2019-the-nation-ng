A 32-year-old commercial motorcyclist, Rabiu Hassan, on Thursday appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, charged with blocking a motorist and beating him up. He pleaded not guilty before Magistrate J. A. Adegun. Adegun granted the defendant N100,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Clifford Ogu said the defendant conspired with two others to beat up Daramola Ola without any reason on July 10 at Agege, Lagos. “The complainant was driving home when the defendant and others blocked his car with their motorcycles. “They dragged him down from his car, beat him up and used a motorcycle key to injure him. “When they saw blood gushing out of his body, they bolted. “A few days later, the complainant saw the defendant, and he was arrested,” the prosecutor said. The case continues on August 9.
