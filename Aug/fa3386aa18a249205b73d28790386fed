The new Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola on Wednesday said he has no knowledge of how the ministry operates. He disclosed this when he visited the ministry shortly after he was inaugurated and assigned portfolio alongside other ministers by President Muhammadu Buhari. While speaking at the ministry, Aregbesola said apart from stories about the ministry on the pages of the newspapers, he had no idea of its policies and operations. “My relationship with the ministry is distant. What I know about the ministry is what I read in the newspapers,” he acknowledged. Aregbesola instructed Barr. Georgina Ehuriah, the Permanent Secretary, who had been in charge since the dissolution of the last cabinet, to continue running the ministry until Monday when he will formally take over. “I will come to take over on Monday. I give the Permanent Secretary the grace to run the ministry till then. We will be ready by Monday to take on the huge assignment,” the former Osun State governor said. Meanwhile, he has assured staff of the ministry and personnel of all paramilitary agencies under its purview of purposeful leadership. He said: “I promise you a realistic, reasonable and commendable leadership,” while urging staff of the ministry to be ready for more work as he will be demanding much more from them.
