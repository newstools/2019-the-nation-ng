The former Director General of ECOWAS Inter-Government Action Group Against Money Laundering, Prof Shehu Abdulahi, at the weekend urged anti-graft agencies to beam their searchlight on poor road projects across the country. Abdulahi spoke at the 12th Anti-Corruption Situation Room (ACSR) with the theme: Mobilising Stakeholders for Improved Accountability and Good Governance Through Asset Declaration organised by the Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. Decrying the poor road projects in the country as compared to other places in West Africa, like Ghana, the professor noted that corruption must also be tackled in the area of infrastructure as contractors do not build roods according to original plans. “We have to fight corruption on the aspect of infrastructure. Most people awarded the contracts of building roads do not build them as contained in original plans. They reduce the size of the thickness and then launder the money,” he said. Abdulahi also urged civil societies and anti-graft agencies to scrutinise issues of corruption “on the angle of asset declaration to know a politician’s weight in terms of asset, when coming into office and when going out of office”. Also, the Chairman of Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Professor Muhammed Isah, regretted that inadequate budgetary provision for the agency and the reluctance of the National Assembly to pass the bill ensuring judicial reform affected the agency’s performance. Isah, who spoke through the Director of CCB, Mr Okokon Esien, expressed optimism that the collaboration of other institutions with CCB would help the agency to perform maximally.
