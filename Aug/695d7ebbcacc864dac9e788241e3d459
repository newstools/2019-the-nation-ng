FORMER U-17 World Cup-winning skipper, Kelechi Nwakali could be the next Nigerian player to make a move in the transfer market following strong interests from a host of clubs around Europe, AOIFootball.com can authoritatively confirm. The 22-year-old player, who has been training at parent club Arsenal since the start of the pre-season was hopeful of a chance with the Gunners ahead of the 2019/2020 season but following his inability to secure a work permit, the midfielder could now seek fresh challenges elsewhere. AOIFootball.com can, however, confirm authoritatively that the attacking midfielder is, however, not short of suitors as a host of top clubs in Spain, Netherlands and Belgium have now indicated their interest in landing the Nigerian permanently. But inside sources have it that the Gunners would rather fancy a loan move for him as they see potentials rather than sell him off or could insert a buy-back clause in his contract should he leave permanently to another club. Nwakali no doubt has the potential to be one of the leading lights in the Eagles midfield having showed a glimpse of it when he lead the midfield against Atletico Madrid in a friendly match last year in Uyo and also wowed the fans in Asaba to help the Dream Team VI reach the final round of the U-23 AFCON qualifiers.
