 Super Falcons Assistant Coach Maureen Madu has been dropped from the team’s technical crew. The Nation  gathered that the former international was dropped alongside other local coaches that have been sharing the heat of the team with head coach Thomas Derneby. The dropped coaches we further gathered had to go as the contract they signed did not extend beyond the World Cup in France where Nigeria crashed out in the group of 16. Madu has been replaced by Wemimo Oni who is currently with the Falconets and will join the senior national team on her return from the Africa Games in Morocco where Falconets have been pitched against South Africa, Cameroon and Zambia in Group B. The African Games formerly called the All-African Games will hold from August 16-30 in Moroccan cities of Rabat, Cassablanca, ElJadida and Khemisset. Nigeria will be competing in 23 sports at the Games. At the 2015 edition in Congo Brazzaville, Nigeria featured in 21 events and finished in the top five with 47 Gold, 55 Silver and 42 Bronze. There were calls in certain quarters for the Super Falcons head coach Thomas Derneby to be shown the door with many insisting that the Swede has not made any input into the team hence the poor show in France. The Nigeria football Federation (NFF) have however chosen to allow him continue just like his Super Eagles counterpart Gernot Rohr has been told to continue his job despite submissions in some quarters that the performance of the team at the last Nations cup in Egypt  where the Eagles clinched the third place, was below par.
