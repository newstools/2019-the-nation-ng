The Federal Government should institute fiscal reform to garner more revenue into its coffers, analysts at Afrinvest West Africa Limited, an investment and research firm, have said. In a report released at the weekend, it said the government needs a strong revenue boost and cost- containment strategies to improve its finances and enhance its contribution to the economy. The strategies to boost revenue, in the first term of President Buhari, fell short of expectations. This includes a whistle-blower policy, which helped in recovering looted funds and the Voluntary Asset and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDs) that supported a broader tax net and N30 billion in receipts despite a target of N305 billion. Accordingly, the Federal Government’s revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) only improved to 3.1 per cent in 2018 from a low of 2.3 per cent in 2017. “To achieve revenue targets, we believe there is a need for comprehensive fiscal reform. This would include action plans to improve the tax system and administration in a bid to drive efficiency by reducing costs and boosting collection. In addition, more transparency and accountability would be required by the citizens to encourage tax payments. The VAT increase being mulled given Nigeria’s lower VAT rate of five per cent when compared to peers represents a quick fix,” report said. However, this would not be a silver bullet as total VAT receipts for the entire country is weak at 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2018. Similarly, as two cities – Lagos and Abuja – account for 75 per cent of the Value Added Tax (VAT) receipts, the government should work on bringing more businesses into the VAT net rather than imposing more taxes on taxpayers.
