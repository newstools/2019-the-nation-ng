A policeman has killed a widow hawking at the Aba Central Police Station identified as Mrs. Peace after hitting her. Sources in the area told our reporter that the deceased until her death hawked second-hand clothing materials within the vicinity. It was gathered that she was hit to the wall by a Mercedes Benz jeep driven by a traffic officer identified as Supol Innocent. Another account has it that Police personnel was trying to reverse the vehicle before he lost control and smashed the widow who was passing-by to the wall unknowingly. She was said to have been taken to the Police Clinic at the Aba Area Command for medical attention by rescuers immediately after the incident happened. Efforts to save her life however proved abortive as she was said to have died a few minutes later as the vehicle injured her on the stomach region, leaving her with severe bleeding. “It was around 1 am. I saw a black Mercedes Jeep that someone was trying to drive out. I heard a loud sound with a woman hit to the wall. It all happened within a second. There was blood all over the ground. “It was an accident that no one can explain or may find difficult to understand because that place is a small place to warrant such an impact,” according to an eyewitness account The Public Relations Officer, Abia State Police Command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, who confirmed the incident, said the corpse had been deposited in a mortuary while the officer is being detained.
