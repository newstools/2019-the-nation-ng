Ilkay Gundogan has signed a new contract extension with City, committing him to the Club until 2023. The German midfielder has proved to be a key member of Pep Guardiola’s squad over the past three seasons and was an instrumental figure in our historic Fourmidables campaign of last year. A 2016 arrival from Borussia Dortmund, Gundogan was Guardiola’s first signing after taking over as City manager and he has since made 114 appearances, scoring 17 goals. A hugely talented, creative midfielder who marries intelligence and industry to great effect, the 28-year-old also demonstrated his versatility last term by impressively operating in the holding midfield role on numerous occasions.
