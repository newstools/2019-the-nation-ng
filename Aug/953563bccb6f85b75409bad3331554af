Chairman of Yaba Local Council Development Authority (LCDA) Kayode Adejare Omiyale has reiterated that education remains the best agent for liberation which would help people serve as agent of development. He spoke at the distribution of free GCE forms to pupils in the council. Omiyale was represented by the Vice Chairman, Nurudeen AIleru. House Leader Solomon Gbinigie admonished the pupils to study hard to come out successfully. “There is no shortcut to success; you must operate with determination, dedication and hard work. You must study hard if you must possess the necessary requirements to secure admission into the higher institution of their choice.” Council Manager Mrs. Kemi Adefowokan advised the pupils to be good ambassadors of Yaba LCDA by fleeing from crime. HOD of Education Mr. Duro Akinola implored the beneficiaries to consider themselves lucky because some brilliant ones who could not afford the cost of GCE forms had lost opportunities to advance in their studies
