InvestNow is a simplified investment application developed to boost accessibility of investment options while enabling one to make returns on their investments. The InvestNow iOS app makes debut with an improved, intuitive and user-friendly interface allowing users to easily sign up, choose an investment product, open an account, fund it and gain returns all from their mobile phones. It also allows users to setup recurrent direct debit transactions, which automatically make deposits into their investment accounts from their regular bank accounts. According to the Group Chief Executive Officer, United Capital, Peter Ashade, “While aligning with our ongoing retail strategy, these upgrades represent another step in the series of innovations aimed at positioning United Capital as a future facing organisation. By providing seamless and delightful user experience to our clients we are taking our award-winning investment options to more people to help them make the intelligent choice and in the long run, deepen our financial inclusion drive.” InvestNow is available for free to android and iOS users on their respective app stores. Individuals can now set up accounts like the Money Market Fund, Eurobond Fund, Securities Trading, Heritage Trust and the Private Investment Trust. For the not so savvy mobile phone users, they can also take advantage of its upgraded website investnow.ng which offers the same level of intuitiveness and smoothness as the other InvestNow channels.
