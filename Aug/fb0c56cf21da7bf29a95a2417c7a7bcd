Nigerians have condemned video footage showing policemen and private guards attached to First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) violently assaulting a man alleged to have threatened to close his account. The incident occurred at Osapa, Lekki in Lagos branch of the bank on Wednesday. Already Nigerians are demanding the arrest of the security men who assaulted the man as well as compensation for the victim by the bank. The video showed the victim spotting a lemon tee-shirt being dragged by one of the private guards while two policemen slapped him repeatedly from opposite direction. It also showed one of the policemen hitting him with the butt of his gun. Trouble was said to have started after the victim had an altercation with another bank customer. He was said to have been asked to leave the banking hall but he refused and insisted on closing his account. His decision to close his account however, did not go well with the operatives who descended on him. Reacting to the video, the bank through its verified Twitter handle said the matter was being investigated. “Our attention has been drawn to a video posted online of an incident that happened at one of our branches. “The bank is currently investigating this unfortunate incident and will take immediate steps to address both the reasons behind the episode and its fallouts. “We assure the public that our customers remain at the core of our business and we are committed to delivering the highest standards in customer experience across all our touch points,” First Bank said.
