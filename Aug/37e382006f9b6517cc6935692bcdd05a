Government must ensure that all children of school age are in school to reduce poverty in the society and prepare youths for future challenges. A member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Enitan Dolapo Badru, representing the Lagos Island Constituency One, made the remarks while flagging off the fourth edition of his holiday coaching for students of his constituency. Dr. Badru said that the level of poverty was high in the society because of the high degree of illiteracy in the country. He stated that “the most effective weapon to fight poverty is education and that is why all eligible children must be in school”. Honourable Badru said that the students were about two hundred and they were given free big notes and mathematical sets. The lawmaker said that the students were also given free T shirts for proper identification, and they filled free admission forms for the programme. According to Dr. Badru, “the students, who have equal representations from the ten wards that constitute the constituency, are being taught in two public schools during the holidays”. The schools are Olowogbowo Methodist Primary School and Saint Patrick Primary School, Aroloya.
