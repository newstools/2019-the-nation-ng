Since winning two gold medals in his maiden outing at the African Games at Harare 1995 in Zimbabwe, Segun Toriola has not missed out from the podium except in 2015 in Congo Brazzaville when he failed to make it to the medal zone. In all, Toriola has won 10 gold medals for Nigeria at the games with four of them being singles title from four consecutive games from 1995 to 2007 and now the Ogun State-born star is ready to quit the stage in Rabat this year. Toriola, who is regarded as the most decorated table tennis player in Africa told our correspondent that he would quit the stage after the 2019 edition in Morocco with this hope that he will make it to his ninth Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. “I think this will be my last African Games and I am hopeful that I can make it to Tokyo and possibly retired in 2020 after the Olympic Games. There is no doubt that I have done my best and it is high time for me to leave the stage for upcoming players to take charge. I am hopeful that we can win the men’s team title in Rabat to secure our place at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,” Toriola said. The France-based athlete was also named the Captain and flagbearer of Team Nigeria at the 12th African Games in Morocco, described the gesture as a honour for him while promising to be a good example for upcoming athletes.
