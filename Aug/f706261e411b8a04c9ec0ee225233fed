President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with national female basketball team, D’Tigress, for a highly impressive outing at the FIBA Women’s AfroBasket 2019 in Dakar, Senegal, that saw them coasting home to victory at the finals, winning the hosts, 60-55. He congratulated the team for the remarkably synergised play that enabled them to outpace and outplay all the teams at the tournament to retain the title they won in 2017, further consolidating their position as African champions with four titles. The President, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, commended the team for discipline, maturity and focus all through the tournament, and deliberateness in promoting the Nigerian flag and accompanying virtues of resilience, persistence and dogged pursuit until victory was achieved. He sent appreciation to all the officials and technical hands that guided the team to win the African title. The President urged them to remain focused in deploying such energy and talent in subsequent global tournaments.
