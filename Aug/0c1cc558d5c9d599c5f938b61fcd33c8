A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State, Prince Mustapha Mona Audu, has alleged intimidation of delegates that will select the party’s candidate on August 29 in Lokoja. But, the party chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello, denied knowledge of any intimidation, saying no delegate to the primary has reported to him about any harassment. Mustapha, who is son of the former Governor Abubakar Audu, said the delegates were being intimidated and compelled to vote for a certain aspirant. He said that he has written to the President, other leaders of the party and security agents. Audu said: “What we are seeing is unbelievable, especially the level of poverty, suffering and the insecurity of delegates right now. Our delegates are in trouble. One delegates from the west had his wife kidnapped. When his wife was returned, they then kidnapped his second son, all in a bid to get them to vote a certain way. “We believe we need to bring this to attention of the public that they are disturbing our delegates and a lot of them have been told not to interact at all with aspirants. This is not the APC we built, this is not the tenets of democracy that we expect. But still, in the face of all these challenges they are still defiling the odds and we are interacting.”
