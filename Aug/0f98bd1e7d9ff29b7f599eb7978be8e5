An official with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) at the Yola International Airport (name withheld) is being interrogated by the police over the theft of $600 from two pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia through the airport. It was gathered on Thursday that the officer, a woman, was found with the money when she was checked following an alarm by her two victims who each said that $300 was missing from their basic travelling allowance (BTA) after the female officer searched them for prohibited items prelude to their clearance for takeoff. One of the airport security operatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that following the incident, which occurred on Monday, an in-house investigation was conducted on the female officer, following which the total $600 and another N1,500 was found in her artificial hair. The airport security source said: “At the initial stage when she was interrogated, she pretended that she didn’t commit any theft on the intending pilgrims. She insisted that nothing like money was on her. “But to the surprise of us all at the investigation room, the said monies were traced concealed in her hair covered with official barrette.” The Yola Airport Manager, Adamu Sheilk, who spoke on the incident, said he had forwarded the case to FAAN’s corporate headquarters for a final decision. The spokesman of the Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Suleiman Yahaya Nguroje, confirmed the development, saying that the FAAN officer in question was being interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CUD).
