The National/State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Awka has fixed Friday for hearing of a motion seeking to relist Mr Christopher Ekweozoh’s petition against Sen. Uche Ekwunife (PDP, Anambra Central). Ekweozoh was the candidate of the Progressive People’s Alliance in the Feb. 23 poll for Anambra Central Senatorial District. His earlier petition filed on March 18 was struck out on April 18 by the tribunal but he returned to the tribunal on Wednesday for relisting of his petition. He assured the tribunal that he could open and close his case within four days, if the motion was granted. He said that the tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to strike out his petition, adding that it breached his right to fair hearing by so doing. Ekweozoh said: “It is in the interest of justice to set aside the said order and relist the petition on the cause list to enable parties to be heard on the merit. “This is to ensure that the respondents will not be prejudiced with the grant of this application, considering that the tribunal is still in possession of the security for cost, valued at N400,000.” The petitioner had approached the tribunal, urging it to upturn the declaration of Ekwunife as the winner of the poll. He claimed that the election was marred by irregularities and did not comply with the Electoral Act of 2010 (as amended). He, therefore, urged the tribunal to nullify the election and order a fresh exercise. (NAN)
