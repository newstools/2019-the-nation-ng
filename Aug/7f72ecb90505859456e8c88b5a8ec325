THE Nigerian Books of Record Research Institute, Abuja, Nigeria, will honour the senior pastor of the Omega Fire Ministries (OFM) worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman, and induct him as a Fellow of the Nigerian Books of Record today. Suleman’s untiring spirit of using the pulpit to fight on the side of the oppressed has earned him a place among eminent personalities like Pastor E.A. Adeboye, President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Pastor W.F. Kumuyi, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Alhaji Aliko Dangote and others, who are on the list of the Nigerian Books of Record’s circle of eminence. A statement, according to the director-general of the Institute, Dr. David David, recognises Suleman as one example of a true Nigerian who is doing so much to improve the international image of the country, especially by using the pulpit to contribute positively to issues of national interest. The DG added that attitudinal re-orientation is the best way to address the myriad of societal problems confronting the Nigerian society.
