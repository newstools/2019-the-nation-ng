Amali Mucheke, a Year Seven (JSS1) pupil at the Lagos Preparatory & Secondary School (LPSS), Ikoyi, Lagos has won the Historical Association’s Historical Fiction Prize for her year. Her story titled: ‘Freedom for All’ based on Colonial Nigeria won her the prize in her category. The Historical Fiction Prize is a yearly contest open to pupils from Year Five to Year Nine (aged nine to14) but is limited to three entries per school. The association requires that entries could be about settings and places in the past. “One of the key attributes of historical fiction is that it has a convincing setting in a past time and place. Students can set their stories in any period or place in the past, so the story can fit in with and extend any historical topic they may be studying,” the association noted. Amali’s entry was sent to London alongside two other LPSS entries, Bethany Okeowo’s, ‘The Maid’s Moment’ and Kitan Fagbamigbe’s story, ‘The Queen, the Candle and the Golden Mirror’.  Amali emerged as the winner for all the entries submitted by pupils from all over the world, in the Year Seven category, According to the judges, “stories in each category are shortlisted by panels of student readers. The shortlist is then judged by our primary and secondary expert panels. ‘’Judges are looking for: Historical accuracy – even down to the choice of names characters are given and any props additional to the historical setting; a riveting read with a good plot; a convincing story – is it plausible that these events and/or this character could have existed at the time; Use of historical knowledge to feed the plot, context and character; Effective use of historical vocabulary and literary conventions, including where dialogue is included in the story; Creative and interesting perspectives of story-telling. In the past we have received an entry telling the story of a siege from the perspective of the castle!”
