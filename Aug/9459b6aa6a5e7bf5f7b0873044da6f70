A consumer payment platform for integrated digital payments company, Quickteller, will take three lucky customers on an all-expense-paid trip to the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest billed for New York, United States (U.S) this month. The winners were drawn from a raffle draw that took place at Interswitch headquarters in Lagos,  alongside the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) and Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council of Nigeria (FCCPC). Group Head, Quickteller Marketing, Olawale Akanbi, said it is a way of giving back to the customers for their unwavering support for the brand Akanbi said: “The success of Quickteller would not be possible without our loyal customers and we want them all to feel like a part of the family and that with Quickteller, everything is possible. So we will be sending 30 lucky customers with an all-expense-paid trip to one of the Interswitch One Africa Music Festivals  in New York, London and Dubai. “In addition to the three winners we have already announced, we have 27 more to go. In a couple of days, we will select and announce more winners for the London trip. Later in the year, we will conduct the draws for the Dubai trip.” The first three winners: Titilope Adedokun, David Eze and Owosegun Shonowo will be attending the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest in New York on Saturday, August 10. Reacting to the surprise, Eze said: “I gave up on promos a long time ago. This is a huge surprise for me and I’m still in shock. Funny thing is, I applied just because I wanted to, and not really because I thought I would win. I am totally elated that I get to have my vacation in New York at the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest.”
