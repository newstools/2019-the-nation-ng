Nasarawa State Police Commissioner Bola Longe has said Deputy Governor Emmanuel Akabe, was not the target in Tuesday’s attack on his convoy. Three police officers and a civilian driver died in the incident. Longe, who briefed reporters on Wednesday after an emergency security meeting at the request of Governor Abdullahi Sule, held at the Government House in Lafia, said the government was disturbed by the incident and had mapped out strategies to avoid recurrence and apprehend the suspects. He said: “The deputy governor was not the target. There was a robbery and the deputy governor’s convoy ran into the scene. That was what led to the death of five persons, including four in the deputy governor’s security vehicle.” The police boss said officers and men of the command have been mobilised to fish out the perpetrators and bring them to book. He urged people to go about their lawful business. “We want to emphasise that the elements that carried out that attack will be fished out. We have started already and we will get there. We will deal with them so that they will know that Nasarawa State is not a place for them to operate,” Longe said.
