The wife of the Anglican Bishop of Ikeduru Diocese, Anuli Maduwuike, who was abducted on her way from Owerri, State capital on Friday has been released. A member of the Church, who didn’t want to be mentioned, told The Nation that she was released after an unspecified sum of money was paid as ransom by the family of the victim. The source said that the abductors had earlier demanded for N8 million but could not say if that was the exact sum paid for the Prelate’s wife’s freedom. According to the source, “God has answered the prayer of the Church; the wife of our Bishop has been released. She has reunited with her family and we are all happy. The Church was thrown into mourning by the unfortunate incident and we went into prayer and we are happy that God has answered us”. It was gathered that husband of the victim, Emmanuel Maduwuike, had a book launch where money was raised for mission work one week before the incident. However when contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, a Superintendent of Police, said he was yet to be officially briefed about her release.
