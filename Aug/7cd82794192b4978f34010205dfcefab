A former National Chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Ibrahim Emokpaire, has greeted the ministers. Emokpaire, who spoke on behalf of the Progressives Solidarity Forum (PSF), congratulated the Federal Executive Council (FEC) “for effectively taking off with the mandate to take the country to higher pedestals in the next four years. The party chieftain praised the APC leadership at all levels, especially the National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and the National Chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, for their support to the President which made him discharge this onerous responsibility in a seamless manner. He said: “I wish to remind members of the Next Level Cabinet that Nigerians have high hopes in their capacity to find pragmatic and sustainable solutions to the challenges confronting the country. Nigerians eagerly desire to see reinvigorated and concerted efforts by the executive towards achieving improved security of lives and property, improved economy and the attendant standard of living, as well as a sustained fight against corruption, all of which constitute the cardinal agenda of the President..” “Without a doubt, delivering good governance towards building a united, well-secured, corruption-free, economically strong and politically stable nation is a huge responsibility. “It is my hope and prayer that the new Federal Executive Council (FEC) will live up to expectations, deliver on its mandate and leave behind a great legacy of selfless service.”
