Arsenal have completed a £25 million deal for Celtic defender Kieran Tierney, with the left-back signing a five-year deal at the Emirates. The Gunners have been chasing Tierney’s signature all summer and saw two bids rejected before eventually meeting Celtic’s valuation on Wednesday. Tierney underwent a medical at the club’s London Colney training ground on Thursday before putting pen to paper just hours before the transfer deadline. The 22-year-old is regarded as one of Britain’s brightest young talents having made his Celtic debut as a 17-year-old back in April 2015. He has since gone on to make 171 appearances for the reigning Scottish champions, scoring eight goals and making 37 assists. His arrival at the Emirates is a big boost to an Arsenal defence that conceded 51 goals in the Premier League last season but he is unlikely to feature in their opening day clash against Newcastle on Sunday. The defender underwent a double hernia operation at the end of last season and has been unable to resume full training after complaining of pain in his groin. Meanwhile, Arsenal are hopeful of bolstering their defence further with the surprise £8 million signing of David Luiz from Chelsea. The centre-back was a regular under Maurizio Sarri last season but reportedly told new boss Frank Lampard of his desire to join the Gunners on Wednesday. The two clubs are now in negotiations, with the Gunners hopeful of concluding negotiations before Thursday’s 5pm deadline.
