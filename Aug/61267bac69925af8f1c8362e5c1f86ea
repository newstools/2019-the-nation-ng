The police in Ogun State have arrested three members of a local vigilance group called Yaluwon, for the alleged murder of 24-year-old Ahmed Obisanwo, an Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State (OOU) student. Obisanwo was alleged to have been killed by the trio on August 9, after they apprehended him and his friend on the accusation that they were cultists. It was gathered that the local ‘vigilantes’, including Idowu Ayodele alias Olori Odo, Segun Ogunbanwo (Kikisore) and Salisu Akeem had that claimed they were taking the students to Ijebu-Igbo Police Division, but later released the other young man. The suspects allegedly killed Obisanwo and threw his body into the Osun River. Their arrest, it was learnt, followed a petition to Police Commissioner Bashir Makama by the boy’s father, Mr. Surakat Obisanwo, alleging that his son had not been seen since his arrest on August 9. He said the local guards were asked and they claimed that they took the young men to the police station, whereas, checks at the station showed that they were never taken there. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the commissioner ordered the anti-cultism unit to investigate and unravel the mystery behind the young man’s disappearance based on the strength of the petition. He said technical and forensic investigation tactics were deployed and the detectives established that the young men accused of being members of Eiye cult by the ‘vigilantes’ were never taken to the police station. “Instead, the security men released one of them and killed the other one who was the petitioner’s son. After killing him, they removed his clothes and threw the body into Osun River for it to flow into the lagoon. “Four locally-made double barrel guns, 10 live cartridges, an axe, a native dagger and one jacket with security inscription on it were recovered from them. Efforts are on to arrest other members of the group connected with the case,” Oyeyemi said.
