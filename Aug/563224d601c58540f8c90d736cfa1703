NIGERIA has ended the 12-year wait for a spot in the final of the African Games after thrashing Algeria 3-0 in the semi-final in Morocco on Monday. The West Africans won the competition twice but had failed to reach the final stage since 2007, when they last won in Algiers. Having advanced to the semi-final for the third time in four attempts, the Nigerians were hoping to subdue the Desert Foxes to boost their chance to reclaim the glory on North African soil. After the restart, Christopher Danjuma’s side failed to impose their dominance over Naima Laouadi’s team until substitute Zainab Olapade added a third in additional time to wrap up the victory. The result also means Danjuma, on his birthday, has led the nation to the final for the first time on the second attempt, after he failed to achieve the feat in Brazzaville four years ago. Nigeria will take on the winner between Cameroun and host Morocco in the final at the Boubker Aamar Stadium on August 29.
