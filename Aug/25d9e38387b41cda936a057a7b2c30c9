An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Thursday remanded in prison custody an unemployed 19-year-old man, Ibrahim Bala, charged with illegal possession of a pistol and attempted robbery. Magistrate J.A. Adegun, who did not take Bala’s plea, made the order following an application by the police. Mr Adegun ordered that Bala be kept at the Kirikiri Prisons until advice on the case is received from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Bala, a resident of Okokomaiko, Lagos, appeared before the court on a temporary three-count charge of conspiracy, illegal possession of firearms and attempted robbery. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Clifford Ogu, alleged that Bala and his accomplices, who are at large, committed the offences on July 7, at Okokomaiko, Lagos. The court heard that the defendant unlawfully had in his possession a pistol and attempted to rob bus passengers. Ogu said: “The defendant and his gang boarded a bus under the pretext of going to Okokomaiko. On the way, they brought out a gun, commanding other passengers to surrender their valuables. “But luck was against them as there was a naval officer in the bus, who intercepted their action. “The officer snatched the gun from the defendant and others escaped by jumping off the bus. “The defendant was then handed over to the Police.” According to the prosecutor, the offences infringed Sections 299, 330 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The case continues on September 4.
