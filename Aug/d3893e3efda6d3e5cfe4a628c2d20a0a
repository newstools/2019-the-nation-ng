The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged the hierarchy of the Army, Police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to speak out on the abduction of its Okene Local Government Chairman, Musa Adelabu, by gunmen reportedly dressed in military fatigue. The party expressed grave concerned over the whereabouts of Adelabu who was abducted in his home on Saturday, with his abductors allegedly telling his family members that they were acting on “orders from above”. In a statement Tuesday in Abuja by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it’s unacceptable that the security agencies have kept mum over the abduction, even as his party and family have continued to demand for his release. The statement said, “This situation has heightened apprehensions of high-level partisan conspiracy to use some compromised security operatives against the opposition in Kogi state, in a desperate bid to foist the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the failed Governor Yahaya Bello on the people of Kogi state. “Already, there is an ominous tension in Kogi state following intelligence reports filtering into the public domain that our LG Chairman is being tortured by his captors in a secret facility where his life is now in great danger. “Such provocative situation is capable of sparking off serious crisis in Kogi state, which location as gateway and convergence state, means a lot of dire consequences for our nation, in the event of any disturbances in the area. “It is therefore completely unacceptable that the security high command is not forthcoming with concrete statement or decisive action to secure his release despite calls by our party and the people of Kogi state. “The PDP therefore calls on President Muhammadu Buhari, as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces to address his parade and ensure the release of our Kogi PDP leader”.
