Italy will set aside six billion euros ($6.73 billion) over the next three years to increase pensions and allow people to retire earlier, the welfare minister has said, rowing back on a pension reform passed in 2012. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi struggles to boost his popularity ahead of a December referendum on constitutional reform on which he has staked his career. Former prime minister Mario Monti sharply hiked the retirement age when Italy was in the front line of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, a move that helped calm markets but was deeply unpopular with Italians. Welfare Minister Giuliano Poletti said after meeting trade unions that the 6 billion euros would boost the pensions of retired people currently receiving less than 1,000 euros per month and allow certain types of workers to retire earlier. Poletti said details of the operation, which will cost less than 2 billion euros in 2017, would be provided in the 2017 budget to be presented by OctoberÂ  20. Italy spends more public money on pensions than any other EU country, around 16 percent of its gross domestic product. Earlier this year Renzi announced a scheme allowing workers to retire at 63 instead of 67, but the plan got an icy reception because the pensions taken earlier would have to be funded by bank loans to be paid back with interest. However, on Wednesday Poletti said people with particularly tiring jobs, as well as the unemployed and those on low incomes would be allowed to retire at 63 without having to pay back any money.
