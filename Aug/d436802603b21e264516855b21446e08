The Katsina State Emergency Management Agency, KASEMA, on Saturday, absolved The Nigerian Red Cross Society of any involvement in the distribution of donated relief materials from both individuals and any other organisation to internally displaced persons, IDPs, in the state The Public Relations Officer of the Katsina State Emergency Management Agency, KASEMA, Alhaji Umar Mohammed, told The Nation that the receipt and distribution of relief materials including the N34m worth of relief materials donated by Alhaji Barau Mangal were received by the agency and distributed to the IDPs according to the instruction given to it by Governor Aminu Bello Masari His words: “the Red Cross is an international agency that is committed to humanitarian efforts. They are quite distinct from the activities of KASEMA in the state. Those insinuating that any relief material was handed over to them for distribution in the state are far from the truth. Alhaji Mangal’s donation was not cash but materials valued up to that amount. ”We received the donation at Government House and on the instruction of the governor, we divided it into two, with half distributed in five Local government areas, namely Dan Musa, Safana, Batsari, Faskari and Kankara. We are waiting for further instruction from the governor to distribute the remaining half,” he said. He further disclosed that KASEMA always distributes relief materials through the local emergency committees, comprising the State Security Service, SSS, Police, Road Safety, etc. and headed by the chairmen of the local government councils The Nation recalled that the Katsina State branch of the Nigerian Red Cross Society recently denied reports making the rounds in the state that it requested or collected donations or relief materials from any quarter to distribute to IDPs in the state. The secretary of the state branch of the association, Alhaji Bala Abdullahi Hussein, told newsmen at a briefing that the agency, being an international body and a humanitarian organisation that is working in the interest of those in needs in the state and auxiliary to public authorities, could not be distracted by acting in proxy on behalf of any donor.
