Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has felicitated with the Muslim community on the upcoming Eid-ul-Adha (feast of sacrifice) celebration, calling on the faithful to spend the holiday reflecting on the lessons of the season. “The message of this season is that of sacrifice, selflessness, and total submission to the will of God as exemplified by not just Prophet Ibrahim, the father of all Abrahamaic faiths, but also Prophet Muhammad. As a faithful, it is not enough to offer animals in sacrifice. We are in fact required to translate these qualities to our day-to-day living.”
