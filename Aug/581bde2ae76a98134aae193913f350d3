Nairobi-based Lori Systems, a Pan-African logistics coor-dination platform that seamlessly connects cargo owners to transportation, has appointed Uche Ogboi as the company’s Chief Operating Officer and Efayomi Carr as Head of Strategic Finance effective from July 29, 2019. Ogboi served as Principal, Investments, at EchoVC Partners, a Pan-Africa and tech-enabled venture capital firm, where she helped to grow the firm’s portfolio both across the region and globally. She has invested in companies across various sectors, including logistics, healthcare, fintech, telecoms and agriculture. She also worked at Citi for eight years as an Investment Banker, where she managed the bank’s Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) fund and was involved in structuring the bank’s agriculture lending initiative. “Lori embodies the spirit of opportunity on the continent for high-growth startups, and I am so impressed by the strong team and what the company has achieved in a short time,” Uche said. She added: “I am delighted to see where this challenge takes me and how we will grow this company together to drive value for customers and help Lori achieve its mission of lowering the cost of goods in Africa.” Carr joins Lori from Quona Capital, where he served as Senior Associate supporting investments across Africa. Before Quona, Efayomi worked with 8 Miles LLP, a London-based private equity firm that invests in Africa.
