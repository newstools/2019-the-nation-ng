In few weeksâ€™ time, the position of the Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) will be vacant. The out-going secretary, Dr Wale Ahmed, has been re-appointed as commissioner by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Ahmed, a former member of House of Assembly, is from Agege Constituency. Will his successor come from the constituency, or the Assistant Secretary, Femi Saheed , will become the acting secretary? Since 1999, the ruling progressive block has been served by seven secretaries under the Alliance for Democracy (AD), the Action Congress (AC), the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the APC. Former House of Assembly member Lanre Ogunyemi (Ojo Constituency) succeeded the pioneer interim secretary who was selected by the AD chairman, the late Chief Ganiyu Dawodu. He functioned under Chairman Abiodun Ogunleye before he was appointed as Political Adviser to former Deputy Governor Olufemi Pedro. When Pedro defected to the Labour Party (LP) and later, the People Democratic Party (PDP), Ogunyemi reiterated his loyalty to the ruling party. His successor was the late Lateef Raji (Oshodi/Isolo) who also served under Prince Ogunleye. In 2007, he became a Special Adviser under former Governor Bola Tinubu. Raji was succeeded by Primate Charles Odugbesi from Ikorodu. He served for one term. After he left, Former Itire Ikate Council boss Hakeem Bamagbala became the acting secretary. Later, he was succeded by Wasiu Eshinlokun Sanni, who in 2015, returned to the House of Assembly. During the last party congress, which threw up Alhaji Tunde Balogun as Chairman, Ahmed became the secretary. Now that Ahmed will be commissioner, who succeeds him?
