The Muslim Community of Lagos State (MCLS) has lamented the rising spate of crimes. MCLS President Prof Tajudeen Gbadamosi, who spoke on Thursday at a state of the nation briefing at the Lagos Central Mosque, Idumota, decried the growing spate of crimes and immorality, saying it is a matter of concern to everybody. He said: “Many of the major roads have become a haven for kidnappers and have been deserted by law-abiding citizens. “Everyday there is a new story of crime. In a recent case, some security and law enforcement officers were accused of aiding criminals. We are aware of the efforts made by the government to tackle this social malady. Indeed, we commend such efforts, be they at the level of the state, zone or nation. However, it is obvious that we cannot continue like this. No meaningful progress takes place in the midst of a rising wave of immorality and social decadence.” Gbadamosi urged the government to address insecurity. “We believe our intelligence units should be equipped to nip crimes in the bud. Our law enforcement agencies should be equipped to respond to crimes swiftly and our courts should be courageous to dispense justice quickly,” he said. The don urged the newly sworn-in political appointees at the state and federal levels to hit the ground running. “They need not be told that much is expected from them. They should always remember that their appointment is a divine call to service. Therefore, they should discharge their duties with justice and fear of God. There is much work to be done in every sphere of our national life,” he said.
