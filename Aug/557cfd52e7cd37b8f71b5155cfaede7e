Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni have commiserated with victims of flooding in Bade Local Government Area and other parts of the state. Buni has, however, directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to provide prompt assistance within 24 hours. About 11 local government areas have been affected by flooding in recent weeks in Yobe State. At Chumbusko Village, near Tagali Village, one of the worst affected areas in Bade, the governor expressed his sympathies to the flood victims, urging them to consider the disaster as a test from Almighty God “whom we must thank at every situation”. The governor directed the SEMA Executive Secretary, D. Muhammad Goje, to ensure that victims of flooding throughout the state are reached within 24 hours to provide them with the succour they need. The governor also assured the people of Tagali and surrounding villages that an asphalted road would be built in the area to make it motorable and accessible so that people would be able to move in and out easily, especially during trying times. The Senate President, who represents Yobe North in the Senate, thanked Buni for his prompt response to the flood disaster. He said water overflows easily from Kumadugu-Yobe River during heavy rains, promising that he would liaise with the Federal Ministry of Water Resources and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to ensure that the dredging of the Kumadugu-Yobe River, which was stopped at 50 per cent since July last year, is completed. The Senate President also gave N10 million to help victims cope with their situation.
