One of the ministers of Buhari’s second term is Sunday Dare, and it is cheering that he has made it. He performed well at the screening, answering questions with ease and intelligence about his performance as commissioner in the NCC. He is also a journalist of long standing who played a role for The News magazine in the rough-and-tumble NADECO days. A polyglot, he speaks Hausa like a native. We expect him to do well as an ambassador of journalism, to show that journalists are “write na do” and talk na do.”
