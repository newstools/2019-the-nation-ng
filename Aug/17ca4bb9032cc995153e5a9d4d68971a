The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi  111,  has urged Muslims to reflect on the Eid and invoke the mercy of Allah and His blessings. In his Id El Kabir message,  Oba Adeyemi said it is imperative to remember that Eid al-Adha symbolizes piety. He said: ‘’This act of godliness, as exemplified by Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh), calls for perpetual sober reflection, submission to the will of Allah, and sincerity of purpose from all of us. as directed by Allah. The paramount ruler advised  Nigerians to cooperate with government in its efforts to restore security. He said: “What we require to overcome our own peculiar trials and earn similar monumental blessings permanently is total and unquestioning surrender to the will of Allah in the conduct of our daily affairs”. ”The various threats to security, as well as the numerous forms of corruption bedevilling our society and the resultant implications of these for the economy are nothing but results of lack of consciousness of ultimate accountability to God, especially in the life to come. This is also true of the mistrust that hinders cordiality among our various ethnic and religious groups. ”What we need, as a nation, are sincere, concerted and sustained efforts towards propagating the kind of God-consciousness demonstrated by Prophet Ibrahim.” Oba Adeyemi said these virtues   will guarantee lasting solutions to  the challenges confronting the country.
