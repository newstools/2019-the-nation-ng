The 21-year-old was consoled by team-mates after his miss as Liverpool lifted the trophy following the 2-2 draw in Besiktas Stadium. “I’m always someone who believes in myself on penalties,” Abraham said in Istanbul. “I had a few last season and a few important ones. Unfortunately today, probably one of my most important ones, I missed. It’s about how I react and just get my head up. “I need to keep going. I’ve scored a few. Unfortunately, I missed one of the most important ones for Chelsea. Keep going. “They say the top players always miss penalties and it’s about how you react. I’ve just got to keep pushing myself. “The boys have made it feel like nothing has even happened. Everyone’s had their arms around me. They’ve said the best players miss, it’s something to learn from. It’s better it happened now than later on. You grow into a man and learn from it. “It’s a great bunch of boys. Now we’ve just got to focus on the game against Leicester.”
