The Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has urged Muslim faithful to reflect on the significance Eid el-Kabir and pray for the progress of Nigeria. In an online message on Sunday, Peterside noted that the prayers of Muslims across Nigeria, alongside those of Christians, had profound effects on the relative stability being enjoyed in the country. He stated that as partners in the progress and development of Nigeria, Muslims had not just contributed their quota, but also made sacrifices towards the corporate existence of the nation. The NIMASA chief stressed that Islam places emphasis on brotherliness and help for the less privileged, hence the need for all adherents to imbibe such virtues. He called on Muslims to be tolerant and continue to work for peace and unity of the country. Peterside said: “Islam is a religion that preaches peace, philanthropy, love and forgiveness. Our Muslim brothers and sisters must emulate these ideals, for the good of Nigeria and humanity. “We must work together for the overall good of all Nigerians and Allah, who has brought us together as one entity for a reason.” The 2015 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers state also called on all Nigerians to continue to support the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, who he insisted was genuinely interested in the greater good of all. He said: “President Buhari’s commitment to a better Nigeria is not in doubt. He is genuinely ready to make the commonwealth of this country available to all. “We may not be where we want to be, but there is no questioning of his direction, vision and readiness to take us to where we should be. The days of hard work are beginning to manifest, things are shaping up. “As his lieutenants, we are daily working hard to bring his vision into fruition. We are daily energised by his determination to take Nigeria to the next level and we are committed to it.”
