The teenage daughter of a British millionaire has been found dead in a swimming pool while on a family holiday in Majorca. Josie Clacher was staying at a villa in the town of Alaro with family and friends when she was found at the bottom of the pool at about 7am on Tuesday morning. Paramedics tried to revive the 18-year-old using CPR but she was pronounced dead at the scene. It was reported she had gone out with friends the night before she died. Rachel Clacher, Josie’s mother, co-founded the telephone answering company Moneypenny, which is said to be worth more than £100m. Mrs Clacher had been staying at the villa with her daughter when she died. The entrepreneur was appointed a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List earlier this year for services to business and her charity work. She established the Moneypenny Foundation – now known as WeMindTheGap – in 2014 to offer holistic paid traineeships to unemployed and disadvantaged young people. A spokesperson for Moneypenny said: “We are all extremely devastated by this tragic news and our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this tragic time.” (www.newsnow.co.uk)
