The Auchi Magistrate’s Court 1 building in Auchi, headquarters of the Etsako-West Local Government Area of Edo has collapsed following a heavy rainstorm on Wednesday. A Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) who visited the court on Thursday reports that the rainstorm also destroyed property worth several thousands of Naira in other parts of the town. NAN also reports that judicial activities at the court have now been suspended due to the rainstorm and the subsequent collapse of the building. The Magistrate Court had been in dilapidated for the past three years as judicial officers find it difficult to carry out their duties at the premises. Following a public outcry, the state government ordered that the court be merged with Magistrate Court II, located on the Auchi-Okene highway, pending its renovation, but since then, nothing had been done until the building finally caved in. The court’s Assistant Chief Registrar, Benjamin Iteghie, expressed shock over the incident and appealed to the state government for help. “The rainstorm has wreaked havoc on our buildings; as you can see, we no longer have a roof over our heads. “We are appealing to the relevant authorities to come to our aid, as the court is no longer conducive for judicial proceedings and activities,’’ he said.
