Members of the Foundation for Montessori Education in Nigeria (FMEN) and other well-wishers slowed down traffic in some parts of Lekki and Ikoyi last Saturday to create awareness about Montessori education for low-income parents in the state. The about seven-kilometre walkathon, which began from the Lekki end of the Lekki-Ikoyi bridge, to Alexander Road and back to Lekki end of the bridge, was organised to raise funds for implementing the project Aid to Life, in 17 Local Government Education Authorities (LGEAs) of the state. Project coordinator, Mrs Yinka Awobo-Pearse, said teaching Montessori principles of Movement, Communication, Independence and Self-Discipline to parents would help them better support their wards’ development into responsible members of the society. “We cannot underestimate the power of parent education.  If we educate parents, they can care for their kids at home.  We are trying to reaise awareness about the programme, which educates parents on how to support their children at home in areas like movement, communication, independence and self-discipline,” she said. Mrs Awobo-Pearse, who is also FMEN treasurer, said the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) had approved the programme for implementation all over Lagos.  She, however, said it cost the Foundation N6,000 to train each parent, who attends the three-day-programme, which has already been implemented in Agege, Ikorodu and Kosofe LGEAs. “It cost N6,000 to train each participant because we give them lunch; leaflets, and gifts since we take them away from their work.  We are looking at reaching 5,00o participants all over lagos.  Donations are trickling in.  but we are hoping corporate bodies will support us. “We have been able to speak to about 500 parents and their feedback was that it had been useful to them.  My hope is that we get more participants so we can reach out to even more children,” she said.
