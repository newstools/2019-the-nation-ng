The Lagos State Government over the weekend warned the general public to desist from the act of attacking the officials of the Lagos State Fire Service and its Fire Engine or face the full wrath of the law. The Acting Head, Lagos State Fire Service, Mrs. Margret Adeseye made the warning following attack on a crew of its Firemen on Friday, at Sam Shonibare Street, Surulere, Lagos, which led to the injury of a Fireman and damage of a Fire Engine. The right door passenger side’s window of the Fire Engine was chattered and the left driver’s side wind screen of its Fire Engine was cracked, thereby obstructing them from carrying out their official duties by unidentified hoodlums. She lamented the extent of the injury inflicted on one of the officers and the damage done to government’s property, describing the Officer as dedicated and hardworking with the motive to save lives and properties.  According to her, the crew responded to a distress call and was caring out their statutory duties when the hoodlums who were restive started attacking them from the scene of Fire outbreak. “An officer was affected by the chattered side screen. In order to prevent confrontation and breakdown of law and order, the officials refrained and reported at Surulere Police Division, Area C.” She therefore appealed to members of the Public to desist from damaging government facilities, noting that lots of tax payer’s money was expended in providing the amenities for the safety of Lagosians. “This negative consequence of unwarranted but coordinated attacks on fire trucks is an indirect denial of other people to benefit from the dividend of democracy as damaged truck cannot be in good condition to serve the need of Lagosians.” She assured all and sundry of the readiness of the Officers to fight fires whenever call upon.
