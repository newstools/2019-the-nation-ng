LAGOS State Government has advised legitimate land and property owners to perfect title documents and other legal documents pertaining to their land and properties. It said this will help put land grabbers at bay and ensure easy administration of justice if such properties are forcefully taken. The Coordinator of the Special Task Force on Land Grabbers, Mr. Owolabi Arole, who spoke on Monday in Alausa, Ikeja while reviewing the report of the task force for first and second quarter of 2019, noted that undocumented and incomplete transactions as well as untidy property documentation make it difficult for property forcefully taken to be retrieved through legal means. He said: “A large chunk of the land grabbing cases the task force is working on is fraught with issues of improper and incomplete legal documentation and such issues cause delay in getting justice for owners of land. “These issues have, however, not deterred us from carrying out our mandate and getting justice for owners of land from unscrupulous elements who forcibly encroach and dispossess them of their property.” Arole said the task force has carried out its mandate to reduce the activities of persons or corporate entities who use force and intimidation to dispossess or prevent any person or entity from acquiring legitimate interest and possession of property in Lagos.
