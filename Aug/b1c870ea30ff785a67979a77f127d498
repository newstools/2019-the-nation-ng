The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has threatened to shut down gas stations operating in unsafe locations in Cross River State. DPR Operations Controller in the state, Mr Philip Awolu, told reporters in Calabar that he had sent notices to various stations warning them to relocate to safe locations away from the public areas for their businesses. He said a gas station must be sited in a suitable area and far from residential homes in case of any emergency. “For those who are in the public places, we have warned them to relocate under one month or risk their station been sealed. “We are just giving the operators some time to do that because some of them have appealed for more time to relocate to proper areas. “As an agency, we must ensure that standard is met and in doing so, we must take safety first,” he said.
