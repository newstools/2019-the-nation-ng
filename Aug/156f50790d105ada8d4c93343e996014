A 40-year-old man, Bisso Aminu has been arrested by the Niger state Police Command for killing his 65-year-old father. The incident occurred in Yingu village in Rijau local government area of Niger state. The Suspect however said he did not regret killing his Father as his Father intended to use him for money rituals adding that if he had not killed him; his father would have killed him. “I can never regret killing my father because he never meant well for me, he almost succeeded in using me as a sacrifice to please his cult members. “I am ready for the worst. I was smarter than him; I killed him when he was sleeping to avert his evil intention of killing me. It shall not be well with him.” Aminu who claimed that his father, Aminu Allahbani had attempted to sacrifice him to his cult group as a payback, said he attacked him with a hoe while he was sleeping which resulted in his instant death. According to him, “I noticed my father’s altitude changed by the way he was treating me of recent and I asked him what was wrong but he refused to talk to me. “My Father was an occult and it was obvious that he had made up his mind to sacrifice me to his group, I have no other option than to kill him.” The Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mohammad Abubakar said the suspect confessed to the crime adding that the suspect would soon be arraigned in court after investigation.
