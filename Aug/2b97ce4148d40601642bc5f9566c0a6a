The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi (II), on Tuesday paid the traditional Sallah homage to Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje despite the frosty relationship between them over the alleged creation of four additional Emirates. The monarch, who arrived at Government House at about 9.30a.m. Tuesday, accompanied by over nine District Heads – all dressed in royal regalia, alongside their horses – were received by Ganduje at Africa House, amidst pomp and ceremony. After the Emir was ushered into the African House, he sat beside the governor. The palace guards, who were clad in their unique green and red combination of flowing gown, sat in front of the Emir and occasionally praising the royal father. During the meeting, Ganduje expressed satisfaction over his administration’s effort to provide adequate security, emphasising that over 99 per cent of kidnapping attempts have been foiled through the collaboration of all the relevant security agencies. The governor added that plans have been concluded to recover ransoms paid to kidnappers by the victims’ families. Also, Ganduje said he would hold talks with President Alpha Conde of Guinea Conakry, focusing on trade relations, between the state and Guinea. The Emir called on the good people of the state to continue to support Government’s efforts toward ensuring security of lives and property, as well as improving the standard of education. Two hours after the traditional homage, no fewer than 10 deafening canon shots were fired into the air in quick succession, to signal the Emir’s departure from Government House, in a horse convoy through designated routes in the metropolis to Kofa Kudu (Emir’s palace).
