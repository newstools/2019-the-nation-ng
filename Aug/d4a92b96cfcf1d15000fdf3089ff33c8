 Everton resisted the temptation to launch their latest new buy Alex Iwobi into the season opener against Crystal Palace on Saturday.  Iwobi who joined the Toffees in the last minute of transfers for £35million was conspicuously missing from the Everton’s line up away against Crystal Palace. The Nigerian international who has already been handed the No.17 Shirt will have to wait till next Saturday when Everton host Watford at the Goodison Park to make the much awaited debut. Iwobi who was given thumbs up by former club Arsenal for contributing immensely to the successes recorded by the club in his over 15 years sojourn at the Emirates is being tipped to help fire the Toffees to the top four at the end of the season. The 23 year old may be tempted to replicate what his uncle and former Nigeria international jay Jay Okocha did for Bolton Wanderers when he joined on free transfer from PSG in 2002. He shunned injury worries then worked so hard to steer the team away from relegation. Bolton fans were so impressed with his performance that the team printed shirts with inscription “Jay-Jay – so good they named him twice”.  He scored crucial seven goals including the team goal of the season in the vital league win against West Ham. Everton put up a good show against hosts Crystal Palace on Saturday earning a point away to begin their quest for glory on a good footing. In one of the opening matches played Saturday, premier league defending champions Manchester City made mincemeat of West Ham United thanks to a 5-0 demolition with Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero having goal feast. Liverpool, who missed the premier league title by whiskers last season, opened proceedings on Friday with a 4-1 defeat of new comers Norwich City.
