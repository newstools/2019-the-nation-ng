LandWey Group has concluded arrangements to begin the development of “The Audacity Skyline”, a 28-floor, coastal shoreline, mixed-use high rise, proposed to sit on 3,500 square metres inside Eko Atlantic City. Making this known in Lagos, during the week, CEO/Founder of LandWey Group, Olawale Ayilara, said the ground-breaking ceremony of The Audacity Skyline is scheduled to hold on  October 1, 2019. He said: “The Audacity Skyline is an architectural masterpiece that will feature tastefully finished beachfront residences and penthouses. Ayilara added that the monumental project will also feature commercial spaces, multi-level parking, designated elevators, personalised concierge services-all executed with best-in-class construction procedures and standards. “As a brand, we are ready and equipped to take on the project armed with our robust experience in construction, as well as our strong partnerships with world class architects, engineers and designers,” Ayilara said. He stated that LandWey has continued to break barriers and set the pace in the real estate sector within the past half a decade. “We’re excited to witness the greatest feat yet in this massive project. The ground-breaking ceremony of The Audacity Skyline is scheduled to hold on October 1, 2019,” he added. The CEO noted that the real estate sector in Lagos has witnessed a lot of growth and innovation within the past three to five years, with an abundance of investment options as well as creative marketing ideas. He, however, said one brand that actively contributes immensely to that growth is the LandWey Group, which boasts a growing asset base of real estate products that are tailored to the middle market, a niche that it has performed comfortably well in. Having conquered that range, the company is now poised to venture into high-end real estate investment products in the most befitting location – the prestigious Eko Atlantic.
