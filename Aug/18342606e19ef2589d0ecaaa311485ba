Authorities of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State have condemned in strongest term, the sexual assault on one of its students by one of the soldiers stationed at a check point between Akungba Akoko and Ikare Akoko. The University, after its preliminary investigation, noted with concern and amazement that a soldier of the Federal Republic Nigeria, whose duty, among others, is to protect lives of its citizens can turn round to exhibit such reprobate tendencies. The Institution, while commending the swift action taken so far by the Brigade Commander on this inhuman and brazen assault on a defenseless and innocent student, called on the authorities of the Nigerian Army to deal decisively with the perpetrator(s) of the act against humanity. A statement by its Acting Registrar, Opeoluwa Akinfemiwa said “We are not unaware of the security situation in the country, we strongly request that the checkpoint be dismantled and the soldiers moved to between Oba-Akoko and Ose where kidnappings and robberies occur, almost, on a daily basis”. The University however called for calm and assured students that it would continue to ensure that adequate security measures are put in place to enable them continue to pursue their academic activities without molestation.
