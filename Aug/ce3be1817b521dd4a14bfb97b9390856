A section of a twin three-story building was on Wednesday night gutted by fire at Emenike/Ezeugo road junction, Okpoko in Ogbaru local government area of Anambra state. The inferno, said to have been ignited by gas cooker, started around 8pm in one of the flats on the last floor. The Nation gathered that property worth millions belonging to some occupants of the building were lost to the inferno. Although no loss of life was recorded in the incident victims counted losses, which comprised their possessions and other valuables. The fire, however was unable to extend to other floors as officials of Okpoko fire service men who arrived the scene almost immediately were able to contain it. An eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, said the fire advanced to the second floor as the water from the fire fighters got exhausted midway. He said: “On arrival to the scene, the fire service men made frantic efforts to prevent the fire from extending to the second floor but their water got finished. “It was smoke which enveloped the entire place that forced residents and sympathisers to assist in pouring sand and water to the inferno before it was quenched.” Confirming the incident, the Acting Okpoko Divisional Police Officer, Mr. George Okoro, said no life was lost. He said: “They said it was caused by gas explosion but we are still investigating to ascertain the exact cause of the inferno.” In a related development, another three-storey building was also gutted by fire same day along Limca old road, Obosi. The cause of the inferno, it was gathered, may not be unconnected with a gas depot close to the scene where one of the cylinders reportedly exploded, setting fire to the roof of the building. No life was reportedly lost as people rallied to quench it.
