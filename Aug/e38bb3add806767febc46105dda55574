THE Oyo State Universal Education Board (SUBEB) has warned the public to be wary of individuals going around extorting money from people with the claim that the board was recruiting. Its Chairman, Dr. Nureni Adeniran, who gave the warning while interacting with reporters in his office in Ibadan yesterday, said many people have contacted him and those close to him on the purported recruitment. According to him, parents, guardians and potential job-seekers should be careful so as not to fall into the hands of the unscrupulous elements that were poised to dupe them in the guise of selling employment forms and assisting in getting jobs. Adeniran said: “Oyo State Government’s attention has been drawn to activities of syndicates extorting money from unsuspecting members of the public under the guise of recruitment in the teaching services of the state. Please disregard such information, as it is false and misleading. “We are using this medium to call on the general public, especially parents, guardians as well as our young job-seekers not to fall victims of these fraudsters.” As efforts were ongoing to track and apprehend the fraudsters, he called on the public not to fall victim of their antics under the guise of public recruitment as the present administration was not recruiting. Adeniran said the necessary medium of relating with the public would be used whenever there would be need for recruitment. “We would be transparent in our operations and make any recruitment exercise known to the public, through legitimate means whenever the state will be recruiting. “Oyo State Government will announce this, when the time comes. We would be transparent in our operations and make any recruitment exercise known to the public, through legitimate means,” he added.
