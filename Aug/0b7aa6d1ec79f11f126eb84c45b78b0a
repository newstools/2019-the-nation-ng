 Is there anything like wasted kiss?  Perhaps some will say it is debatable depending on the reason for the kiss. The ponder, took the center stage after a Brazilian footballer rushed to the stands to kiss is wife after scoring a goal only to turn back to realise that the goal has been disallowed! Wanderson cristaldo farias who plays in the Bulgarian league with Ludogoret Razgrad broke the deadlock in their tie with Slavia Sofia which was progressing with 0-0 scoreline. The 31 year old who joined Ludogoret Razgrad in 2014 from Brazilian side Portuguesa, was so excited at finally separating the two sides with his goal that he ran all the way to  celebrate with his wife but returned to find his teammates in action and unimpressed with even the technical bench not smiling. It would have been more painful had Slavia Sofia seized his period of exit for celebration to score. The match ended 0-0, leaving Ludogorets in second place in the Bulgarian league, while Slavia Sofia sits in eighth place. The former Oeste ace has played the majority of his career at Ludogorets, joining in 2014 after a few years playing in Brazil. He received Bulgarian citizenship in 2017, and was subsequently called up to the national team for a Euro 2020 qualifier against England, but he didn’t feature in the game. Afterwards, he would have been fuming to learn that he wasn’t even close to being offside, meaning the goal should’ve stood after all.
