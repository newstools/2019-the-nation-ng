Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has said hard times await kidnappers. He spoke on Monday when he received the Remo League of Imams, who paid him a Sallah visit at his Iperu home. The governor described kidnapping as an economic crime that must be stopped by all means. He said most of the kidnappers were foreigners who disguised as herdsmen, adding that it would not augur well if criminals were allowed to operate and hurt Ogun State regarded as the industrial hub of the nation. “We don’t want criminals to cause problem for us. The state hosts a lot of companies and industries. It will not augur well to hear that crime is prevalent in our state. “I have asked that those caught in the recent kidnappings be brought to me. My government will not spare anyone caught in kidnapping henceforth,” Abiodun said.
