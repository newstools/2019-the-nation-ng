Nigerian entertainer Charles Oputa, known as Charly Boy, has said being in hell after death will not be difficult for him since he has adapted to the Nigerian situation. Charly Boy, on his Instagram handle, posted a photo of himself in a casket, captioned: “If I died and went straight to hell, it may take me more than a week to realise that I am no longer at work or living in Nigeria. Yeye rulers. God go punish una soon.” The entertainer and activist, who always berates the Federal Government on issues yet to be addressed in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on last Tuesday in Abuja, said hie will soon release a single, featuring rapper Folarin Falana, popularly known as Falz. Charly Boy said he decided to work with Falz because of his philosophical style of music addressing leadership issues and societal ills. He noted that the project was an advocacy song targeted at driving positive a narrative in the society. “Falz is a young man that I so much believe in his music and passion for positive change in all aspects of our society, and we share similar thoughts. We are working on something together and it will surely stir positive change in our lives as Nigerians.” The former president of Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria said he decided to use music as a tool to inspire ordinary Nigerians, especially youths, towards holding leaders accountable. He explained that he was leading an advocacy and enlightenment campaign: Na we be government and decided to go back to music, his age-long passion, to call citizens to participate in nation-building. “All over the world, the arts, especially music, have been used to inspire people and change the narrative towards a better society. I did not go into music for money, but for the passion for it, and this time I am using it to awake the consciousness of  Nigerians towards building the country they desire,” he said.
