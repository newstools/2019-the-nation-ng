Leaders of the Benue Motorcycle Association, Gboko branch, have expressed their excitement with Governor Samuel Ortom’s rehabilitation of some roads in Gboko, one of the state’s biggest towns. Those who spoke when The Nation visited the town to monitor the road rehabilitation work included Shua Aondoakula, Fidelis Akaahemba, and Asue Aondoaver, chairman, deputy chairman, and secretary general of the association. They stated that the rehabilitation has boosted the economic fortunes of their members as well as contributed immensely to the lifespan of their motorcycles. “The numerous potholes on the roads delayed movement, our motorcycles got spoilt easily and regularly, the rehabilitation has made our movement faster and our motorcycles more durable with better returns every day,” Aondoakula stated. “I believe that it has also helped people in other businesses too. When roads are good, the economic situation of a place improves and we believe that this is also the case in Gboko and so we really commend and appreciate Governor Ortom.” “Our joy knows no bounds for what Ortom has done for us, we cannot thank him enough, he should take time and come to Gboko and see how we will respond to him,” Akaahemba stressed. “A lot of roads are being rehabilitated. If you go round the town, Captain Downes Road, Gondo Aluor Road, Makir Zakpe Road, all these roads are being rehabilitated.” Mr John Anum, former public relations officer of the association, said what Governor Ortom has started doing in his second tenure is an indication that he had indeed freed himself from what had hindered him from working. “What he has started, if sustained, will keep the people of Gboko who are always unanimous in their voting pattern to support him whenever he comes knocking,” Mr Anum stated. Project Engineer, Zabet Consult Limited, John Orahii, confirmed that the people in Gboko are very happy and excited adding that in fact they have commended the state government so much for doing this project.
