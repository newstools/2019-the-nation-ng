Oyo State government has assured the state’s stakeholders that the Governor Seyi Makinde’s administration will not increase tax on small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) in its drive to soar up its revenue base. Chairman of the state Board of Internal Revenue (BIR), Aremo John Adeleke, gave the assurance in a statement issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism Dr. Bashir Olanrewaju yesterday. According to Adeleke, instead of increasing tax, the state would rather look into areas that were not captured in its tax net to improve the internally generated revenue. He added that the plan of Makinde’s government is to build and nurture the growth of SMEs and not to burden them with heavy tax that could drive them out of business. “It is in line with the promise of Governor Makinde to empower small-scale businesses in the state to propel growth in our economy. “As he works assiduously to attract foreign and domestic investments to the state, he is also working to establish and sustain small and medium scale industries in Oyo State. So, the idea of tax increment on businesses is not even to be discussed here. We will rather nurture them to grow and be self-sustaining than to over-burden them with tax. “The government nonetheless expects all SMEs to comply with all extant tax laws, especially the ones on personal assessment of business proprietors, withholding tax and VAT payable to the state,” Olanrewaju quoted the state revenue boss as saying. Adeleke, however, enjoined commercial vehicle owners and drivers as well as motorcycle riders and owners to collect necessary documents from approved agencies and tax stations under the state’s internal revenue services, instead of doing the same in neighbouring states.
