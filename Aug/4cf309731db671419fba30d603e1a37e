Bayer Leverkusen scored three times in the first half to ease past hosts Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-1 on Saturday. The victory put Leverkusen alongside leaders Borussia Dortmund with maximum points from their first two Bundesliga matches. A sixth-minute own goal from Lewis Baker put the visitors ahead and Charles Aranguiz added another goal in the 33rd. His effort was initially ruled out for a suspected handball but following a video replay the goal stood. Kevin Volland, who was also involved in the first goal, set up Karim Bellarabi for their third goal six minutes later. Fortuna cut the deficit in the 82nd with Alfredo Morales. Freiburg are also on six points after coming from a goal down to beat promoted Paderborn 3-1. Borussia Moenchengladbach, on four points, did the same for a 3-1 victory at Mainz 05. Dortmund beat Cologne 3-1 on Friday to lead the standings on goal difference. Champions Bayern Munich, on one point, take on Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen later on Saturday. NAN
