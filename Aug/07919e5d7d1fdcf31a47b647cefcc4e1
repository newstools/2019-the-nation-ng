The Governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu says that his administration would soon clear areas of salaries owed to workers in the state. This is even as the governor has described the Abia workforce as one of its most prized assets and will therefore continue to engage the leadership of the organized labour in the State in meaningful dialogue in the quest for the improvement of the welfare of workers in the State. According to a release by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka the Governor stated these at the Governorâ€™s Lodge Aba when he received the Chairman of the Abia State Chapter of the Nigeria Labor Congress, Comrade Uchenna Obigwe. Ikpeazu expressed his personal appreciation and that of the State Government to the entire Abia workers for their patience, understanding and unflinching support even in the face of daunting challenges and assured that every effort will be made towards addressing all outstanding issues affecting their welfare. Governor Ikpeazu assured that immediate steps will be taken to pay off the arrears of leave allowances while other issues affecting the state workforce would be sorted later. As at the time of filing the report, Ikpeazu was in a scheduled meeting with representatives of organized labour in the state.
