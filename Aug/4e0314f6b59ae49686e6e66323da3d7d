Super Eagles’ Midfielder Etebo Oghenekaro is expected to team up with his English Championship club side Stoke City after a long break. The former Warri Wolves’ midfielder played every minute for the Eagles as the Nigerian National Team won bronze at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. He was given an extended break by Stoke City to enable him to recover on time for the new season. Stoke lost their first game of the season against QPR and would be eager to have their last season’s best player available for the next.
