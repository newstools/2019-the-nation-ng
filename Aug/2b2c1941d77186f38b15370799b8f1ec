Ten patients have benefitted from the Brachytherapy (implant) treatment for prostate cancer. The brachytherapy is said to be a new form of treatment for prostate cancer that is less time consuming. A Medical Consultant and Radiation Oncologist who developed the treatment Dr. Oludare Folajimi Adeyemi said the disease is the commonest cancer among men. Dr. Adeyemi stated that one out of every seven men is likely to develop the disease. Conducting reporters round his health facility, Dr. Adeyemi said brachytherapy treatment of the disease would go a long way in helping Nigerians suffering from the disease. “Although, there are other options of treating prostate cancer, the brachytherapy method is very unique, accurate and it offers high degree of cure to the patient with prostate cancer, especially when it is done at the early stage of the disease. “What we do in this discovery is to implant a radioactive inside the prostate and right inside the prostate, begin to release radiations which ended up killing the cells. It damages what we call DNA and when DNA is damaged, the cells cannot actually produce any longer. “Over 10 patients have benefited from this new discovery of mine and the beauty of the brachytherapy treatment method is that, it is done one time and between two and three hours, you are done and the patient can go home”, Dr. Adeyemi said. Representative of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Dr. Ofene Enang commended Dr. Adeyemi for the breakthrough in the treatment of prostate cancer in Nigeria. Dr. Enang said the NMA was at the forefront of canvassing for reversal of medical tourism in the country.
