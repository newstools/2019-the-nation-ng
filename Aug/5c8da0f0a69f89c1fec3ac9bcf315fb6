The Oyo State Police Command on Thursday paraded four suspected arms dealers, who concealed 10,000 live cartridges, allegedly for supply to criminals. Also paraded were 21 other suspects, who were nabbed by the officers of the command at various places across the state. Among the suspects were two young women found in possession of one double barrel pistol on their way from Mushin in Lagos State to Iseyin in Oyo State, allegedly to carry out their operations. Addressing reporters at the parade ground, Eleyele Police Headquarters, Ibadan, yesterday, Police Commissioner Mr. Shina Olukolu advised residents to be wary of criminals, and to be security conscious, following the approach of the festive season. He said they should be mindful of who they transact business with, to avoid being swindled. The arms dealers, who were arrested on July 23 at Oke-bola, Ibadan, included Adekunle Abimbola, Abel Kojo, Mukaila Ariyo and Ade Adebayo. Confessing that they have been in the business of ammunition/arms supply for years without a licence, the suspects disagreed that robbers and bandits were their buyers. Rather, they told reporters that hunters were their customers However, the police boss, who insisted that the ammunition were supplied to armed robbers, said the suspects would be made to face the full wrath of the law.
