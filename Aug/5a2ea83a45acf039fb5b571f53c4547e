STYLE-WISE, people are often scared to experiment in the rainy season, which results in monotonous colours like black and harsh attires becoming a staple in their wardrobe. But do not let the downpour send your fashion into a tailspin! Covering up most part of your body is what you need to do in this cold season. And no other piece of wear does this well than stylish long attires that will cover almost all parts of the body. And when you are thinking in terms of the sweater to wear, it doesn’t have to be the normal, swollen pullover or close fitting knotted jackets with or without sleeves. You can combine a good jacket and a stylish top with either skirt or trousers under. Go for long fitted hand-length tops. Search through your wardrobe, you will certainly get some few things to work on. That way, you won’t have to look dull. Gone are the days of wearing sweaters on formal wear. Go for bright accessories to add a dash of colour to your look. Don’t be afraid to experiment with fashionable clothes in diverse hues. Make your outfits less dull with a splash of colours!
