Kaduna State Chief Judge Justice Muhammad Lawal Bello has sworn-in 40 magistrates, warning them against engaging in any form of corrupt practices. Administering the oath of office on the magistrates on Monday, Justice Bello told them that they must live above board in administering justice according to the oath of their office. He, however, asked them to master the code of conduct for judicial officers and the rules of professional conduct for legal practitioners. The CJ said: “Your conduct must be geared towards saving the legal profession and invariably the entire structure with which justice is administered. “You must also not forget that the true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good governance..” The chief judge, however, hailed Governor Nasir El-Rufai for his cooperation, support and good work to the judiciary. But, the magistrates, who took oath of office one after the other, swore to eschew corruption in the discharge of their duties.
