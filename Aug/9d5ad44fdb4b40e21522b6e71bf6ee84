Ikeja Electric Plc (IE) has collaborated with multinational retail company, PEP Stores, to enable customers pay bills or recharge their account at designated PEP Stores across Lagos. Under the deal, post-paid and prepaid customers within IE network can pay their bills and recharge their account while doing regular shopping in PEP Stores located in Gbagada, Maryland Mall, Ipaja, Isolo, Allen Avenue, Ikorodu, Ogba, Awolowo Way, Ojodu Berger, Idimu, Amuwo Odofin, Ogudu and Ikeja City Mall in Lagos. Fielding questions from reporters at the launch of the initiative, the Acting Chief Commercial Officer, Ikeja Electric, Ugochukwu Obi-Chukwu, said the essence of providing the payment  outlets was borne out of the company’s customer-centric approach to service delivery. He said: “The collaboration between Ikeja Electric and PEP Store demonstrates our passion to consistently improve service and make energy available to consumers. This initiative gives convenience and seamless service to customers who need to recharge their account or pay bills. Another interesting benefit of this partnership is that most of the outlets open on weekends so customers can walk in to purchase token for energy or pay bills just as they shop other needs.” He noted that the possibility of paying bills or buying electricity units while shopping and the convenience it offers will definitely provide a rich and satisfying experience for customers.
