THE Oyo State Police Command yesterday gave a stern warning to organisers of street carnivals to be wary of disgruntled youths and idle individuals, who are always willing to use such avenues to extort money, intimidate their perceived rivals and commit crimes. Some residents were in the habit of organising street carnivals, especially during the Ileya festival, which on many occasions turned violent and bloody. The police, however, said it would not hesitate to deal ruthlessly with anyone found in the act of disturbing public peace during and after the Eid-el-Kabir celebration, under any guise. In a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, the command said the police would not stand by and watch some violent individuals or groups under the aegis of carnivals to engage in activities that would disturb the peace of the environment or that may lead to a breakdown of law and order. “Consequently, organisers of such unapproved street carnivals should be ready to bear the consequences of any negative fallout before, during and after the celebrations,” the police said.
