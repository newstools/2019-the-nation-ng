Oyo State governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, has felicitated with Muslims on the celebration of the 2019 Eid-el-Kabir, urging them to imbibe the virtues of Prophet Ibrahim, who, in obedience to Godâ€™s directive, was ready to sacrifice his only son. He admonished the Muslim Ummah in the state to reflect on the significance of the celebration, which he said bordered on encouraging piety, sacrifice and love, noting that without these, no state or society could advance.
