The Federal Government has paid rent on a piece of land that houses the National Control Centre, Osogbo, Osun State, for 50 years, it was learnt. The Centre belongs to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). TCN Managing Director, Mr. Usman Gur Mohammed, who spoke in Abuja said the power firm has, however, stopped paying the rent. He said the Federal Government  paid rent on it for five decades, adding that at the point of planning to install a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) in the centre, it realised that it was inappropriate to install it in a rented property. While deciding to relocate the centre, the TCN was told that the property on which it has paid rent for 50 years actually belonged to the Federal Government. On this discovery, he said the  government has stopped further rent payment on the property. He, however, did not say anything on whether the government will recover the fund from the private individuals that had fraudulently collected the rent for five decades.
