The Presidency has declined to comment on a media report alleging the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on National Assembly (Senate), Senator Ita Enang, has been relieved of his appointment. Until the latest report, Enang, like several other aides of the President, has continued with his appointment in the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration without renewal. Senator Babajide Omoworare, a former Senator from Osun state, is claimed to have replaced Enang as Presidential aide to the Senate. It was also claimed that Enang has been redeployed to a ministry as SSA to the President. But no government official was willing to confirm the latest media report. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant on media and publicity to the President, Mallam Garba Shehu said the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha was in a better position to speak on the matter. “SGF is in a better position to speak on that,” he stated. Also several calls put through to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, on Monday were not picked. There was also no return call from the SGF as at press time.
