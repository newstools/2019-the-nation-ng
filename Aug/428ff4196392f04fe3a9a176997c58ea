The female top seed also feels excited coming to Nigeria with the impression of a lovely weather and hopes to give  her best as this will be her tournament after the holidays. “Well, it’s my first tournament after the holiday break so I just hope to enjoy playing. I think the the atmosphere and the hall are pretty nice. “It’s my first time of seeding number one in a senior competition so I will try to enjoy and give my best because it’s a game so I can’t say if I am going to win or not. I will be very happy to be in the semifinals but after tomorrow we will see what next comes in.” Meanwhile, Nigeria’s female number one, Edem Offiong hopes for a podium finish as she will be starting her campaign today in the Round of 32 main draws against India’s Akula Sreeja. Edem Offiong won bronze at the 2018 ITTF Africa Top 16 and the 2018 ITTF Africa Senior Championships. The 31-year-old player has featured in the All Africa Games since 2007. The Cross River State-born player said that: “Been seeded in this tournament is an advantage for me and I hope to go further in the game but I know it’s very difficult because playing against top players in the the world is quite difficult but I am a little confident because I know I am in good shape and I hope to go further, hopefully, get to semifinals.”
