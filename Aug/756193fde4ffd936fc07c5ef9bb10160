The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has charged medical practitioners to adhere to professional ethics to save lives. Head, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Bauchi, Prof Calvin Chama gave the advice at the NMA Bauchi State chapter Annual General Meeting (AGM). Chama, who presented a paper with the theme, “Knowing your limit as a doctor”, emphasised that it is only by so doing that patients will have the confidence to patronise the health facility. Chama, who pointed out that doctors also need to know their rights in the performance of their duties, stressed that one should not override  other’s rights because the rights of patients and doctors are interwoven. The consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist said it is when a doctor could not differentiate between the two rights that conflict occur, which may lead to dire consequences. He stresed the need for medical doctors to put their patients first. In his opening remarks, ATBUTH Chief Medical Director Dr. Mohammed Alkali urged members of the association to live above board. According to him, the patient has the confidence that the moment he gets to the health facility, issues will be treated positively. Alkali added that when such confidence is betrayed, the patient will be  discouraged from seeking medical attention. He said health practitioners should synergise to promote efficiency. Bauchi State NMA Chairman Dr Lamara Dattijo said the AGM was aimed at awakening members on the need to be professional in their calls to save lives, adding that the chapter will take a cue from older professionals who had excellent records in practice.
