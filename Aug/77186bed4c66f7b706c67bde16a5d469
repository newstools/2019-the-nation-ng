 Will Super Eagles forward Alex Iwobi be interested in moving over to Goodison Park, and will Arsenal indeed be ready to let go of their boyhood player? That is debate among teeming Gunners fans after Everton tabled £30million (about (N13.2billion) , for his services. Everton who finished 8th on the log last season are desirous of fighting for a place in the top four and reportedly believe that the Nigeria international who was impressive at the last Nations cup in Egypt despite Super Eagles’ third place finish can help them achieve the dream. The Marco Silva tutored side have prior to this time been pursuing Ivorian international and Crystal Palace ace Wilfred Zaha but received a capital no from Palace who are not interested in losing any of their star players ahead of the new season, forcing The Toffees to shift attention to Iwobi. Iwobi netted six goals last season and provided nine assists and there is no indication that the Gunners are not enjoying his contributions. The Emirate landlords have never at any time indicated that they are ready to show escort their man to the exit door but some fans worry that the cash on the table may force a reconsideration especially with Arsenal coach Unai Emery reportedly seeking funds  to  beef up in defence. No official response has been dished out by the Gunners neither has 23 year old Iwobi who is successfully flying what could pass for a family flag in football  after the exploits of his uncle and former Nigeria midfield maestro Jay jay Okocha reacted to the development. Some fans who reacted following the news break say it will pay the Nigerian to remain at Arsenal in their own words “With a club that is sure to play either in Europa or Champions league every year and not one that has taken permanent position in the middle of the log”
