The management of University of Ibadan (UI) has lifted the ban placed on student union activities in the institution. Following a protest on May 30, 2017, the University Senate, under the leadership of Prof. Idowu Olayinka, the Vice-chancellor, suspended the students’ union. Prof. Olayinka confirmed the development as ‘true’. He said the senate met on Friday and lifted the suspension on students’ union activities. Also, the Director, Directorate of Public Communications, Tunji Oladejo, also confirmed the development saying that the university is ready to conduct leadership training after the election. “We are ready to work with the crop of new leaders so as to move the university forward,” he said. The Nation however gathered that the erstwhile President for council of Faculties, Victor Olaonipekun, has been charged with the responsibility of conducting a ‘free and fair election’ for the Students’ Union within the next 9 weeks. It should be recalled that the Ojo Aderemi-led administration led a protest in 2017 over the non-issuance of identity (ID) cards which subsequently led to the suspension of the union. Olayinka’s reversal of the suspension of union’s activities has elicited cheers from the students and many alumnus of the institution.
