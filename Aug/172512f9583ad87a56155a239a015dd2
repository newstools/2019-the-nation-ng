The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu, has said there is a strong link between corruption and the growing insecurity across the country. The EFCC chief said the need for concerted efforts in fighting the scourge is non-negotiable, if the country’s peace must be restored. Magu spoke in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, while featuring on the University of Ibadan (UI) Diamond 101.1 FM during the agency’s weekly programme of the agency, “Eagle Alert”. The EFCC chief, who was represented by the Ibadan Zonal Head, Mr. Friday Ebelo, noted that the deprivation occasioned by high-level of corruption had created fertile grounds for all forms of criminality which in turn threaten the country’s peace and security. He said: “You can’t separate the growing insecurity from corruption. The surest path to peace in our country is to take care of the menace of corruption. “If we succeed in stemming corruption, we will berth a working system in which the problem of infrastructural deficit will be addressed. Ignorance will be kept at bay, and there will be more jobs for the people. All that will effectively address the problem of insecurity.” Calling for cooperation from the public in the campaign against graft, Magu noted that despite the powers granted it by the law, the EFCC cannot alone win the battle. The acting chairman advised parents to show genuine interest in the development of their wards. He said rather than encourage unmerited flamboyancy, parents must ask sincere questions when they notice that their children or wards start living questionable life styles. The “Eagle Alert” is a weekly sensitisation programme on UI radio station. It is designed to propagate the activities of the EFCC and avail the public the opportunity to take advantage of its mandates.
