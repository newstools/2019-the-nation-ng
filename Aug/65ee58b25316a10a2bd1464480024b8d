The National President, Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB), Mr. Kunle Awobodu, has identified building collapse as the major challenge facing the construction industry. Speaking in Port Harcourt, he said the menace of building collapse has created doubts about the competency of practitioners and artisans in the international community. He said the menace was man-made and could be overcome, if there was genuine interest to right the wrong. “About 10 years ago, when I was the chairman of the NIOB in Lagos State, the frequency of building collapse in the state made the then Governor, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, to set up a technical committee to reform the Physical Planning and Development Law of the state. “The committee developed a bill that was passed by the state House of Assembly and assented to by the governor in 2010, becoming the new Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law,” he said. Awobodu continued: “Promulgating the law was one hurdle crossed, but the implementation becomes a bigger hurdle.” According to him, compromise and corruption remained the bane in the fight against building collapse. He, however, noted that NIOB must sustain the efforts to ensure that buildings that are being constructed in Nigeria meet the required standard. He said if builders were complaining about that the construction sphere is replete with quackery, NIOB should proffer the solution that would encourage developers and clients to patronise trained builders. In view of this, he said, “Self-development and professional competency drive will be salient in the programme of this new NIOB administration.” Awobodu said the institute would embark on international collaborations to equip members with latest construction technology and improved construction methodology.
