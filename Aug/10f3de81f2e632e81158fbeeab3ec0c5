Operatives of the Ogun State Police Command have  arrested two brothers, Sunday Durosinmi Onikoyi, 29, and Felix Durosinmi Onikoyi, 20, for allegedly defrauding unsuspecting members of public with fake currency. The arrest of the duo who reside at 30 Akala Street Idi-Oro Mushin Lagos followed a complaint  by one Moses Nwese of Gas-line area of Ijoko in Sango- Ota, who claimed that two men came to his shop to buy two bags of rice and gave him the sum of N29,000 (Twenty Nine Thousand) in one thousand Naira denomination. He stated further that they left his shop hurriedly and while counting the money, he discovered that all the one thousand naira notes were fake. Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said that a police patrol team went after the suspects  and caught  up with them  in an Honda Odyssey car with registration number LSR 504 AZ. “On searching them, N78,000 (Seventy Eight Thousand Naira) fake one thousand naira notes were recovered from them. Also recovered from them were  one unregistered Bajaj motorcycle and 10 bags of rice,” he said. Oyeyemi said the suspects would  be arraigned before a court of competent jurisdiction as soon as investigation is concluded.
