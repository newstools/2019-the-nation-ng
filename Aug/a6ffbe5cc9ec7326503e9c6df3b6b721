Timber dealers in Cross River State have appealed to the government to allow them buy timber from outside and sell in timber markets across the state. Under the umbrella of Cross River Southern, Central and Northern Senatorial Dealers Association, the dealers spoke after its general meeting in Calabar. The meeting was presided over by presidents of the northern, central and southern districts – Cletus Asho, Pastor Author Odu and Asuquo Ita. They lamented that as major stakeholders in timber, the ban had almost ground their business to a halt. The dealers said they were not against the government’s decision, but they should be allowed to source and buy wood from outside and sell in the state, so they will not go out of business. “…we can no longer eke out a living from timber business, and as employers of thousands, the lull … may force us to lay off …workers unless the government does something … to ameliorate our plight. “Beyond this, the ban has also affected the state’s economy negatively as it has forced an upward review of timber products…” They said sought audience with Governor Ben Ayade in a July 31 letter but have received a reply. The dealers said they support government’s programmes and policies, especially afforestation, and appealed that as stakeholders in timber business, the government should carry them along on initiatives on the industry.
