Barcelona and Real Betis have reached an agreement for the transfer of Junior Firpo for an amount of 18 million euros plus 12 million euros in variables. The player will sign a contract with the club for the next five seasons, until June 30, 2024, with a termination clause of 200 million euros. At only 22 years of age (August 22, 1996), Junior Firpo is a left-back of great promise. Born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Junior moved to Málaga aged six. There he played for various local clubs such as Atlético Benamiel and Puerto Malagueño. In the summer of 2014, he joined Real Betis and made his way through the youth categories at the club. On February 12, 2018, he made his first team debut against Deportivo la Coruña, and, as a starter, was key in the 1-0 win at the Riazor. From then on, he played almost every match until the end of the league season. In the 2018/19 campaign, he played 29 matches (24 in the league, four in the Europa League and one in the Copa del Rey), scoring three goals. They came in the draw against Celta Vigo, at the Camp Nou during the 3-4 win over Barça, and against Real Sociedad (1-0). He also provided five assists. Despite being born in the Dominican Republic, he is a Spanish international with the U21 team. He was part of the squad that won the U21 European Championship in 2019, and, as a key player, contested three games in the tournament.
