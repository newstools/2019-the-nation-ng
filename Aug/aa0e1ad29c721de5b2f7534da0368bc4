 Former Man United coach Jose Mourinho has declared his readiness to return to coaching insisting that resting has seized to be fun. Many had predicted following his sack from Old Trafford that the ‘Special One’ who has managed seven different clubs starting with Benfica cannot cope for long outside the football arena. The Portuguese live-wire, who was sacked by Manchester United in December, says he is missing football and admitted recently he is “full of fire” over a potential return. His focus is on returning to club management, in either the top-flights in England, Spain, Germany, Italy or France. Mourinho told Sky Sports News: “I have some time to think, to rethink, to analyse and what I feel is exactly that ‘Ze’ (Mourinho’s nickname as a boy) is full of fire. “My friends tell me ‘enjoy your time, enjoy your July, enjoy your August, enjoy what you never had’. Honestly, I can’t enjoy. I am not happy enough to enjoy. “I miss my football, I have the fire.” However, reports in Spain claim Mourinho has in fact targeted a return to the Real Madrid hot-seat and that he believes an opening there could soon present itself. The club had a tumultuous pre-season and while they won their opening LaLiga match of the season, Saturday’s draw with Celta Vigo has heaped focus back on Zinedine Zidane. And while Zidane made a raft of summer signings at the Bernabeu, he is yet to find the right balance in his side.
