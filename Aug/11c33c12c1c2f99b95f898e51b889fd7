The Institute of Directors (IoD) said there was need for the Federal Government to further engage relevant stakeholders  on the prospects and challenges of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement. Its new President/Chairman, Governing Council, Chief Chris Okunowo, who spoke in Lagos during his inauguration, said the trade liberalisation deal that promises to create a continental trade bloc of 1.2 billion people, with a combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $3.3 trillion. With this huge financial promise, Okunowo said there was need to further engage with stakeholders in both the private and public sectors whose diverse inputs will further help strengthen relevant institutions to allow the country to take advantage of the agreement to boost trade and investment. Okunowo said such engagement was with a view to enhancing the country’s chances of benefiting optimally from the treaty  signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari had signed the free trade deal on July 7, this year, at the 12th Extra-ordinary Summit of African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in Niamey, Niger Republic. This came about 16 months after foot-dragging on the signing of the hotly-debated AfCFTA, with Buhari citing the need to consult widely with stakeholders on the benefits or otherwise of joining the continental trade bloc.
