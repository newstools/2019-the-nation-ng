The mother of the woman, who was allegedly shot dead by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) at Ijegun, Lagos, Mrs. Abosede Taiwo, is seeking justice. She said she wants justice at all costs. Speaking to The Nation on Monday, the woman alleged that the deceased, Mrs. Busayo Owoodun, was hit by a stray bullet during a shooting that ensued when suspected SARS operatives chased some people suspected to be cyber fraudsters (yahoo boys). Amid sobs, Taiwo urged the Lagos State Government to support the deceased’s three children. She said Busayo was her only child and her death portended doom for her. The woman said: “They have taken my only child, my joy, my everything. She fed me morning, afternoon and night because I am jobless. How will I cope? “I am appealing to the government to help her three children. They must not suffer.” The deceased’s husband, Yusuf Owoodun, said it had been a task coping since his wife was pronounced dead at a neighbourhood hospital. He implored the government and well- meaning individuals to assist him regarding the education of their children. Owoodun said: “I am calling on the government to help us. I cannot train these children with my tailoring work.” The Nation gathered that the deceased was felled by a stray bullet in front of her house when she attempted to shield her youngest child from danger when the shooting began.
