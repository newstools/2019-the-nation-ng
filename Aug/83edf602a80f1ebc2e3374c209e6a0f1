President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with renowned chartered accountant, iconic leader and legendary teacher, Chief Akintola Williams, who turns a centenarian, August 9, 2019. Buhari congratulated him for many honours and pride brought to Nigeria and Africa. President Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, commended Chief Williams for his pioneering and pacesetting roles, laying the foundation for many institutions in the country, which include Nigerian Stock Exchange and Institute of Chartered Accountants, which have long turned into strong pillars of the Nigerian economy. As first chartered accountant in Africa, the President believed Chief Williams’s prudent utilisation of time from his youth, and a proclivity for looking beyond circumstances, separated him early for global recognition, turning him into an institution that many will continue to study and draw inspiration from. He extolled the centenarian’s adventurous spirit of seeking and taking up challenges like music, arts and promotion of culture, underscoring his willingness to always serve the country and move it to greater heights through knowledge, wisdom and counsels to leaders. The President joined family, friends and professional colleagues in celebrating with Oloye Williams on his 100th birthday, and for achieving the feat of inspiring the largest professional services firm in Nigeria with Deloitte & Touche. He prayed that the almighty God will grant Chief Williams health and strength to continue serving God, the country and humanity.
