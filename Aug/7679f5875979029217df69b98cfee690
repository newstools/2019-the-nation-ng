Simon becomes the latest Nigeria international to move to France this summer after Victor Osimhen’s switch to Lille and Henry Onyekuru’s move to Monaco. After joining Levante on a five-year deal last August, the pacy winger went on to make 19 appearances at the Valencia outfit with a goal to his credit in his debut campaign. The move reunites the 24-year-old with ex-Gent teammate and Mali international Khalifa Coulibaly as he aims for improved playing time in the 2019-20 season with the Stade de la Beaujoire outfit. Simon was a member of the Nigeria squad that finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. He has been handed the number 27 shirt at Nantes and will be hoping to make his Ligue 1 debut against Marseille on Saturday.
