The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to release ‘political prisoners’. Addressing newsmen on Tuesday on the side of a visit to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri at the Government House in Yola, Secondus said there should be no room for political prisoners in a democracy. “We ask Mr President, Mr Buhari, to release political prisoners. It is not done in any political dispensation. What we are seeing today is as if we are in a military era. He should urgently release political prisoners and allow a political atmosphere and a country where there is freedom of speech,” the PDP chairman said. Urging the media to take the lead, Secondus said, “I want to call on journalists and media managers not to sit on the fence. They can’t just sit and watch the country sliding. They played major role in the past, removing the country from the hands of the military. They have tempered with some among them. It is time for them to join hands with the good people of Nigeria to stand on the path of truth, on the path of democracy.” Emphasizing the view that freedom of conscience must be allowed its reign in a political environment, with particular reference to the arrest of the presidential candidate of the Africa Action Congress (AAC) in the last election and convener of the #RevolutionNowmovement, Omoyele Sowore, Secondus said, “The president must release political prisoners, particularly the presidential candidate of AAC, Sowore.” Secondus who said the PDP leadership visited Adamawa to commiserate with Governor Fintiri over the loss of his father, enjoined Adamawa people to support the governor to achieve high performance. He said, “God has given you the best governor. It is up to you to support him.”
