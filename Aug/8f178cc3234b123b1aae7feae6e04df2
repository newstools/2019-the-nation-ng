Delta State has urged residents in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer areas. The state government said this decision is based on the warning by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) about the rising levels of water, especially the River Niger. This was made known by Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu shortly after the maiden State Executive Council (Exco) meeting in Asaba, the State capital. “Currently, we had the inaugural executive meeting; a lot of far-reaching decisions were taken and we resolved that we enlighten our members about the warning by NEMA that flood is rising and our people who are living in flood-prone areas should, as a matter of urgency, relocate to safer areas. “Our governor, Ifeanyi Okowa presided at the Executive meeting and the issue of safety of our people in riverside communities was seriously discussed; measures are being put in place to ensure that the flood situation is properly managed. Recall that our governor was very proactive in managing the flood situations in the previous years and we are calling on our people to start relocating now,” Mr. Aniagwu said. The Commissioner for Works, James Auguye, revealed that the Executive also approved the construction of two more storm drainage to channel water “from Okotomi axis in Okpanam to terminate at Iyi Okwu Stream and another from the Specialist Hospital to drain into the storm drainage on Ralph Uwechue Street.”
