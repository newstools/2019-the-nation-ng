Technology firm, OPPO on Wednesday assured that it was in the country to do business and support the Federal Government initiatives at growing the economy. Its Marketing Manager, Mrs Nengi Akinola who spoke on the sidelines of the unveiling of new smartphones, OPPO A1k and A5s, said the firm did not rush into the market but conducted extensive research into the needs of Nigerians, adding that all the devices from the stable of the firm were produced after an extensive research into the needs of the local market. According Mrs Akinola, the mobile brands that rushed into the market fizzled out no sooner had they come because they failed to carry out diligent study of the market. She said OPPO which is currently on the fifth slot in global mobile phone ranking, has been operating in about 40 countries, including North Africa, will continue to grow the business in the country. Speaking on the devices, she said it boasts of a 32GB ROM and long battery life and features this year’s most popular waterdrop screen, as well as a stylish metallic texture back cover. With a robust 4000mAh battery, it leverages AI algorithm optimisation to reduce power consumption, delivering long battery life. According to her, it also employs APCF material on the screen, stressing that under the same power dissipation level, the screen gets higher brightness, allowing user to see more clearly while lowering power consumption. “Thanks to AI algorithm optimisation, its MTK6762 CPU enables several applications to run seamlessly at the same time, effectively eliminating freezing and serving multiple user scenarios while reducing power consumption. All in all, A1k supports up to 17 hours of daily usage, delivering exceptional long battery life,” Mrs Akinola said. She added that with a 6.1-inch LCD waterdrop screen plus 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a 1560×720-pixel resolution, its screen design drew inspiration from a water droplet on the verge of falling, it is a perfect device.
