THE Nigerian Air Force said at the weekend that scores of Boko Haram terrorists have been neutralised as air strikes targetted at their command structures were conducted at the fringes of Sambisa Forest. Its spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement that the strikes were conducted after intelligence report indicated the presence of the terrorists in the area. Daramola added that the strikes followed the launch of “Operation Green Sweep 3” by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole. The statement reads: “In a renewed offensive aimed at further eliminating remnants of Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province Terrorists (BHT/ISWAP) in the Northeast of Nigeria, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has launched Operation GREEN SWEEP 3, which targets some identified terrorists’ positions in Borno State. “In furtherance of the operation, the ATF on 9 August successfully destroyed a BHT Command and Control Centre at Dusula on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest. “The operation was executed after series of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions led to the identification of the Command Centre with its solar panels, communications equipment and other facilities. “The 3 Alpha Jets dispatched by the ATF engaged the location in multiple passes, recording accurate hits on the target area.” The statement added: “The structures housing the Command Centre were completely destroyed by the strikes while several of the terrorists were neutralised. “The few surviving terrorists, who were seen attempting to flee the area, were taken. “The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its operations against the terrorists in the Northeast.
