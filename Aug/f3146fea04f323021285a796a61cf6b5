State-run oil firm, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporration (NNPC), yesterday said it ws not willing to compete with Dangote Refinery over market share. Its Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said rather than compete, the Corporation will continue to provide support to the promoters of the project to boost domestic refining capacity. Receiving the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, at the NNPC Towers, Abuja, Kyari said as the chief enabler of the economy, the NNPC has a duty to rally industry players such as Dangote Group to achieve the elusive target of making the country a net exporter of petroleum products. According to a statement, the NNPC GMD assured that the same level of support would be provided to other promoters of refineries, adding that the ultimate goal was to enhance domestic refining to the point of self-sufficiency and ultimately for export. Earlier in his presentation, Alhaji Dangote said the business approach of the Dangote Refinery was to see NNPC as a collaborator rather than a competitor. He said the refinery would rely heavily on the Corporation’s invaluable knowledge of the refining business in the country to achieve its central objective. Dangote aligned his company with the Federal Government’s aspiration to ensure adequate in-country refining capacity, stating that on completion the refinery would dedicate 53 per cent of its projected 650,000 barrels per day (bp) refining capacity to the production of petrol. “The most important thing for us is to see how we can partner with NNPC, it is not to see how we can compete with NNPC. We would like NNPC to be part of us and we also want to be part of NNPC.  I think that is the only way we can achieve a win-win situation,” he said.
