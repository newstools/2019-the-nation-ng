Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is yet to appoint commissioners more than two months after his swearing in for a second term. He is holding consultations with stakeholders on the modalities for the appointments. According to a source, “the governor does not want to make mistake in his appointments and wants to carry the people along.” Ugwuanyi also set up a committee to screen the selected individuals which, whose names be forwarded to the House of Assembly for approval. Besides, the governor has mandated councils to recommend people of impeccable character and achievers for appointment. Said the source: “His Excellency will not want the situation where he will unilaterally chose people that are unpopular in their local government areas. ” Stakeholders in the local government areas are involved in choosing candidates for appointments. The governor gave the opportunity to make the choice themselves and submit the names to him, after which the committee will do the screening.” Each local government was given two slots of commissioners. The governor is battling with insecurity, which has unsettled the people. In recent times, kidnappings and killings have been perpetrated by suspected herdsmen. The governor has been visiting dark spots where these criminals carry out their activities. He has ordered the recruitment of 1,700 forest guards who would monitor and provide security in the affected areas. Each of the 17 councils would be required to recruit 100 guards. The governor is also contemplating the use of drones.
