Aruna Quadri sees a tough competition ahead in Men’s singles title at the ITTF Challenge Plus, Nigeria Open which opens today at the Molade Okoya-Thomas hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. After loosing to Omar Assar of Egypt in the semifinals of the just concluded ITTF Africa Cup, Quadri’s hope for a better tournament soars even as he will be facing top players. “Table tennis has gained ground in Africa and Nigeria in terms of participation, sponsors and the amazing fans who have been very supportive,” he said on Tuesday in Lagos. Quadri, who is the tournament’s no.1 seed, added: “Just like I won last year and I didn’t believe but of course I strongly believe it is possible to repeat last year’s feat but it will be very difficult, not just for me but for all the participants.” Commenting on this year’s Nigeria Open, Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) President Ishaku Tikon is sure of a better event. He promised yesterday that Nigerians will enjoy an exciting competition. “Last year we had 27 countries that participated but this year we have 32 countries participating, so you expect it to be more explosive. The way the organisation of the tournament have been going on, the input of the LOC and of course the quality we have put in place will continue to attract star players across the globe and I promise Nigerians that they are going to witness the table tennis they have never seen before,” he said. At stake is $60,000. To show sills are 171 players (105 men and 66 women) from across the globe.
