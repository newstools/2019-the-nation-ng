A former Commandant of the National Defence College (NDC), Rear Admiral Ilesanmi Alade (rtd.), has advised Defence Minister Bashir Magashi to ensure accountability in the utilisation and spending of defence budget. Alade also advised him to implement the National Defence Policy. The former NDC commandant, who spoke with The Nation in Lagos, noted that accountability would rebuild public trust in the Armed Forces and win the masses’ support in counter-insurgency warfare. He also urged the minister to understudy the various threats plaguing the country. Alade said about 80 per cent of the nation’s security challenges was internal, which requires thorough understanding to confront. The ex-NDC commandant noted that the implementation of the National Defence Policy would make positive changes in the Armed Forces and fast-track the rehabilitation of the Defence Industry, a key driver of innovation and job opportunities. He said: “The Defence Minister should study the current threat assessment of the country, both internal and external. Everybody knows our major problem is internal. So, the security and military architecture should be essentially geared towards solving our internal security problems. “The Defence Minister must, as much as possible, implement the harmonised policy of the Armed Forces – Army, Navy and Air Force. The National Defence Policy, which was approved, should be implemented. There will be a lot of differences in our security architecture if that policy is implemented.” “The policy takes care of everything, including strengthening of the Defence Industry. The policy is key and they should not pay lip service to it. The defence institutions must be properly funded. The minister should ensure accountability in the utilisation of defence budget and spending.”
