The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned the recurring armed robbery attacks on the female hostel of the University of Uyo (UniUyo), Akwa-Ibom State. CAMPUSLIFE gathered that the angry female students staged a peaceful protest last week over what they said was the second robbery in three days. National President of NANS, Comrade Danielson Bamidele Akpan, said it was ‘unspeakable and unacceptable’ for bandits to invade the female hostels twice within a week and robbing the victims of money and other personal effects. He said: “This robbery gang did have enough time such that they dispossessed the female students of their valuables such as; laptops, phones, gadgets, and cash.  The information further revealed the brazenness with which the terror gang came with POS and forced students to insert their ATM cards and transfer their money to them” “Condemning in strongest terms this beastly act of the armed robbers, we wish to expressly request that the management of the University of Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State, do everything possible to arrest the perpetrators of the terror and prosecute them “In the meantime, I have directed NANS National Ex-Officio 1 Comrade Ekemini Inyang, to manage the crisis in order to avoid escalation or lead to a repeat of the June 12, 2013 students’ unrest in University of Uyo. Now that students have threatened a showdown, it is expected that all stakeholders should work together to avert disruption of academic calendar.” Danielson urged the management to provide adequate security for the entire school, especially the female hostels, to reassure students of its commitment to their security.
