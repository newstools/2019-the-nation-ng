The Zamfara State Government on Saturday sealed the fate of the suspended Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Cika Ibrahim and the district head of Kanoma, Alhaji Ahmed Kanoma, by sacking them from office. The duo had been suspended for allegedly being part of armed banditry in their respective domains on the strength of an investigation by a committee set up by the state government to investigate the allegations levelled against them. The committee recommended that they be stripped of their positions after claiming that they were culpable. Deputy Governor Mahdi Aliyu Gusau said the two traditional rulers were found wanting. Consequently, the state government decided to remove them to serve as a deterrent to others. Ibrahim and Kanoma had been manhandled by their subjects last month at Kanoma town, while the residents also called for their removal when Governor Matawalle paid a condolence visit to the families of 32 persons killed by the bandits.
