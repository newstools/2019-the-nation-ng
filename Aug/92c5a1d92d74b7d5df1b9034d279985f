Cafe One, Nigeria’s first digital, hybrid experience centre by Sterling Bank Plc, recently hosted award winning Nigerian writer, Lesley Nneka Arimah, in collaboration with Farafina Books. She is the author of a collection of short stories titled, “What It Means When A Man Falls From The Sky,” which won the 2019 Caine Prize for Africa. According to Tobi Jaiyesimi, Business Manager, Cafe One, the book reading event tagged “In Conversation with Arimah,” is one of the ways through which the platform is connecting with its community of innovators who are desirous of upping their craft. The session was anchored by Ope Adedeji, managing editor at Zikoko, who quizzed the author on the inspiration behind the themes explored in her stories, her journey as an author, her mentors, hobby, among others. Responding, Ms Arimah said she was elated when her work was selected as the winning entry in the Caine Prize for Africa writing competition. She told the audience that she tries to follow human logic while writing, saying “it is good we are telling our stories by ourselves.” She said the inspiration for the book came from an observation she had with a friend.
