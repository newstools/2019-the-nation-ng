An Israeli combat aircraft on Monday hit the Palestinian movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip after rockets were fired from the territory of the enclave. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that militants from the Gaza Strip fired three rockets toward southern Israel, intercepting two by Israelâ€™s Iron Dome air defense system and the other hit a road in the vicinity of the coastal Palestinian enclave. According to the IDF, in response, its combat aircraft attacked a number of targets at the Hamas military base in the northern Gaza Strip, including the office of a Hamas battalion commander. Meanwhile, several Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli counter-attacks and airstrikes against Hamas sites had occurred in the last few weeks. Israel has been imposing a crippling blockade on the Gaza Strip since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Hamas had intensified its campaign against the blockade with weekly rallies near the fence between Gaza and Israel, killing more than 200 Palestinians since the rallies began in March 2018.
