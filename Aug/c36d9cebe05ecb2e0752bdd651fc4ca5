Commissioner of Police in Anambra state, John Abang has assured adequate security in and around lodges of corps members across the state. Abang gave the assurance on Tuesday while receiving the State Coordinator of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Mr. Kehinde Aremu in his office. The CP said the corps members need not to panic over their safety, insisting that their security was part of his mandate in the state. He said, “Security of corps members in the state forms part of the responsibility of my command. “I assure you of adequate and maximum security and safety of corps members and their lodges across the state.” Abang however requested for the locations of all corps members’ lodges in the state to enable the command patrol and secure them adequately. He also stressed the need for the command to be furnished with information that could assist in policing the nooks and crannies of the state. Earlier, the NYSC helmsman, Mr Kehinde Aremu, said the visit was to show gratitude for the high profiled Police officers being sent to secure lives and property during orientation courses and corps members’ lodges in the state. He however appealed to the command to intensify its patrol around corps members’ lodges in the state.
