The Oyo state police command on Monday read the riot act and vowed to apply full wrath of the law on anyone participating in Revolution Now protest. Parents were also warned not to allow their children to be used. In a statement issued by the command Monday, the Oyo state commissioner of Police, Mr Shina Olukolu, insisted that anyone caught in the act of protest would be made to treasonable charges, while describing the protest as illegal and an attempt to topple democratically elected government. The Revolutionnow protest was called by Omoyele Sowore, presidential candidate of the African Action Congress in the February 2019 General Election, and publisher of the online medium, Sahara Reporters. He described the move as a protest against bad governance in the country. Sowore was on Saturday arrested by operatives of the Department of State Services at his home.
