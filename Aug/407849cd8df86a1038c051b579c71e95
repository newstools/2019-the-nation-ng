A magistrate Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Friday ordered the detention of Sunday Awolola, a soldier, who allegedly raped a student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko two weeks ago in prison custody. Awolola a soldier attached to the 32 Artillery Brigade, Owena Cantonment, Akure, was alleged to have raped the student at military checkpoint along Ikare Akoko-Akungba Akoko road. The dismissed soldier was handed over to the state police command for prosecution. The Ondo State Police Command on Wednesday arraigned the 33–year-old accused person on a one-count charge of rape. According to the prosecutor, Mr. Adeoye Adesegun, the accused person “committed an offence Contrary to Section 357 and Punishment under Section 358 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Vol. 1 Laws of the Ondo State of Nigeria 2006.” At the court proceeding, the prosecutor told the court that the case file had been transferred to the Director of Public Prosecution of the Ondo State Ministry of Justice for legal advice. He also prayed the court to remand the accused person in the prison custody pending the outcome of the DPP’s legal advice on the matter. But the defence counsel, Mr. Kayode Ikotun disagreed with the prosecutor, asking the court to grant the accused person bail to enable him take care of his health challenge pending the next adjournment date. He pleaded that sending the accused person to prison custody might aggravate his (accused) bad health condition. However, the magistrate, Mr. Mayomi Olanipekun granted the application of the prosecutor as he ruled that Awolola should be remanded in prison custody pending the time the legal advice of the DPP would be ready. He adjourned the case to November 15, 2019.
