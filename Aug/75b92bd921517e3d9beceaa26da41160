Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday met with the Hausa – Fulani leaders in Southwest, Kogi and Kawara States in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, over insecurity and banditry in the region. He called on Nigerians to stop the culture of “passing blame” and think of a lasting solution to the menace. Obasanjo said the solutions to the nation’s security challenges should not be left to one person to address, adding that it is not what one man can tackle alone. According to him the solutions can come through collective efforts and not through “passing of blame” here or there. He said the West African countries are worried about the security challenges in Nigeria, stressing if Nigeria they looked up to as big brother is unable to deal with her security issues, where would they run to for help if theirs hit home.
