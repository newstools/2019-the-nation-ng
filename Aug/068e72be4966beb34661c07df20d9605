The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Thursday revealed more reasons behind last Saturday’s attack on former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu in Nuremberg, Germany. The group accused Ekweremadu of being a self-centered politician, who engaged in the politics of personal survival. In a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB alleged that Ekweremadu had not promoted any legislative advocacy for the South-East geopolitical zone as the longest serving senator. The group said although it had not expected the lawmaker to change Nigeria, he refused for force out anger and frustration in the Senate. The statement reads: “This distinguished Senator is a typical example of the new breed Igbo politician, permanently engaged in the politics of personal survival, forty years after the Biafra genocide. “Ike Ekweremadu, the distinguished senator representing Enugu state is the longest serving Igbo denator. He has survived in the murky waters of Nigerian politics by playing to the rules of the politics of survival. ” Enugu, his home state is besieged on all fronts by Fulani militants. Men, women and children, even priests are being slaughtered on a daily basis. We are yet to hear our distinguished Senator speak with clarity on the matter. “Those who are blaming IPOB Germany for manhandling Ekweremadu are poor students of history. “You do not persuade an angry people with patriotic rhetoric. Leaders who can not gauge the anger and fury in their land must be truly blind and not qualified to represent them. “Igbo politicians like Ekweremadu loved Nigerian “than the owners of Nigeria, a case of being more Catholic than the Pope. ” For a mere slave role, they love their prison and zealously promote a system that puts their people down.”
