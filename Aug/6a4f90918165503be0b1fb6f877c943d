Friends for life! That seems the situation with Princess Abah Folawiyo and Senator Ita Giwa. So when it was time to cut her 77th birthday cake, the former chose to do it at Echoes of Calabar, her friendâ€™s highbrow restaurant in Victoria Island. The guests had lots of delicious Calabar cuisines to choose from. Not many were called because it was just meant to be for family and close friends. At 77, Abah, the matriarch of the Folawiyo family and the doyen of Nigerian fashion, is still glowing with life and good fortune. Abah Folawiyo is the mother of Segun Awolowo jr, the Executive Director of Nigerian Export Promotion Council and grandson of former Nigerian nationalist, socialist and statesman, Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Princess Abah Folawiyo is a known philanthropist and mother to many who are not her biological children.
