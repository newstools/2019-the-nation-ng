The Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment has inaugurated its reconstituted Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit (ACTU). It charged civil servants to operate within the rules. Inaugurating the ACTU, the ministry’s Permanent Secretary (PS), William Alo, said the public servants should operate within the country’s laws, rules and regulations to deliver quality and timely service to the public. He noted that the ACTU is established in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), through the directive of the Federal Government, to conduct preliminary investigation, review corruption-prone operational system, educate and enlighten staff on issues related to corruption, as well as monitor budget implementation in the Ministry. The PS urged the ACTU Committee members to rise up to the challenge of being in the vanguard of fight against corruption, and reminded them that “the fight against corruption is the integral part of the crusade for national rebirth, social inclusion and regeneration”.
