Public health experts speaking across various platforms have yet called for increased mental awareness and education to reduce rising cases of depression and suicide in Nigeria. A global health advocate who works with Avon Medical Practice, Dr. Chinomso Egemba, in an opinion article titled: ‘Protecting Nigerians from Dichlorvos: How about protecting mental health’; identified depression as a major cause of suicide. Egemba described depression as a psychological state of unhappiness or low morale, which could last longer than several weeks, including ideation of self-inflicted injury and suicide in extreme cases. “We have to call on the bodies responsible, which include the government, to increase the level of mental health awareness in Nigeria and set up toll free lines and counselling centres across the nation so that people battling depression can call or visit for help,” Egemba advised. Similarly, a public health advocate and digital media strategist, Dr. Chioma Nwakanma, said common health problems such as depression and anxiety affect one in four people and it may not be easy to notice.
