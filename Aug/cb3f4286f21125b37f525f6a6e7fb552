Gunmen have killed the Adamawa Southern Senatorial Zone Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Saâ€˜idu Kolaku. The Nation learnt that the hoodlums killed him at his home at Mayo-Belwa, the headquarters of Mayo-Belwa Local Government Area of Adamawa State. MACBAN spokesman Muhammad Jika Buba said the killers were likely to be those who had been abducting and collecting ransom from people in the southern zone recently. Our correspondent recalls that Kolaku was among the community leaders across the state who received awards of recognition on July 17 from the command for helping the police to fight crime. Police Commissioner Audu Madaki, who handed over plaques and certificates of recognition to the community leaders, praised them for helping the police in the fight against crime. He on that occasion celebrated five individuals who he said had renounced their kidnapping activities and handed over their AK47 guns as a proof of repentance. The MACBAN spokesman said Kolaku had been under the surveillance of the killers, who eventually killed him after warning him on the phone several times to stop fighting them. Confirming the murder, police spokesman Suleiman Yahaya said the incident happened last Saturday, adding that the command had drafted an anti-homicide squad for investigation.
