Nigerian schools registering pupils for Cambridge International examinations have grown to more than 360 this year. A statement by Cambridge Assessment International Education noted that the number of schools teaching the Cambridge International programmes had increased by 10 per cent; and students taking the IGCSE and AS & A Level examinations by 12 per cent. Regional Director, Cambridge International, Juan Visser, said: “I am delighted that the uptake of Cambridge qualifications continues to go from strength to strength in Nigeria.  This is in no small part due to the tremendous effort on the part of our registered schools in Nigeria preparing learners for our examinations. “Our examinations have proven to be an excellent platform for learners to get into, and get on, at institutions of higher learning. “Congratulations to the schools, the dedicated teachers, and not the least, the students.  These results have been duplicated in the many countries across the sub-Saharan region where our schools operate, proving that there is a strong demand for robust programmes of study supported by valid and reliable examinations trusted by universities across the region.” This year the most popular Cambridge IGCSEs in Nigeria are maths, biology and physics. The most popular Cambridge International AS & A Level subjects are physics, chemistry and biology.
