Two women, Blessing Asugwa and Joy Ogbu, who allegedly defrauded a housewife of N21 million, were on Wednesday brought before an Ebute-Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos. Asugwa, 23, and Ogbu, 24, were arraigned by the police on a three-count charge of obtaining under false pretence, fraud and theft. Prosecuting Inspector Oladele Adebayo alleged that the defendants committed the offences between 2015 and 2017 at the Computer Village, Ikeja, Lagos. The court heard that the defendants collected N21m from the complainant, Mrs Amaka Joel, with a promise to help her invest in a business but failed to do so. They allegedly failed to return the money. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Asugwa and Ogbu pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate O.O. Olatunji granted each defendant N5 million bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on September 3.
