Gunmen on Monday attacked the Chief Accountant in the Office of the Niger State Head of Service, Idris Abdullahi, and snatched over N9.5 million from him. The victim was said to be returning from bank at about 10:30am where he went to withdraw the money. It was learnt that the money was meant for the overhead expenses of the Office of the Head of Service. The incident happened barely two weeks after gunmen waylaid an official of the Niger State Judicial Service Commission and snatched over N1.5 million meant for the commission’s expenses. An eyewitness told The Nation that the gunmen blocked the chief accountant’s car when he got to the secretariat’s gate. Then they shot sporadically and removed the money from the car before escaping. It was gathered that the shooting caused pandemonium, as everyone, including guards, ran for safety. The eyewitness said the hoodlums drove towards the Customs office, along the western bypass where they abandoned their car, hijacked another vehicle and drove off. Efforts to get the Office of the Head of Service to comment on the incident proved abortive. Police spokesman Abubakar Muhammad described the incident as unfortunate. He said: “We are on the trail of the gunmen.”
