Operatives of the Directorate of State Security have been subpoenaed to testify in the petition filed by Hon Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma against the election of Hon Jude Ise-Idehen for the Ikpoba-Okha/Egor Federal Constituency seat. Ehiozuwa is asking the tribunal to declare him winner of the election. At the continuation of hearing of the petition yesterday, the tribunal fixed August 19 for the DSS operatives to appear before it. Counsel to Agbonyinma, Robert Emukperu, informed the tribunal that the DSS operatives are to tender statements obtained from ad hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Agbonyinma who testified in the case described the phone call he received from an INEC adhoc staff, Suleiman Ikhuoria, as a ‘miracle call’. He said he immediately reported to the DSS who carried out sting operation by giving him marked money to give to Suleiman. The tribunal accepted to listen to the audio recording of the conversation between Suleiman and Agbonyinma. Suleiman had called Agbonyinma thinking he was talking to a PDP chairman. From the tape, Suleiman was heard in the telephone conversation that he has delivered for the PDP. Other witnesses that testified said results were not announced at the polling units but taken to the Ward collation centre. Aigbogun Emmanuel said he signed altered results for him to have evidence to show his party. Promise Igbinevbo said there was no collation of results and the votes were not counted in Unit 5 Ward 8. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice O. Ogundana, adjourned sitting to August 19 for the respondents to open their defence.
