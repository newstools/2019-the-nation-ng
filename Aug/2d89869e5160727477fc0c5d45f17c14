IT is no longer news that the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State lost all the polls conducted in the state during the recently concluded general elections to the rival Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Not on the strength of the latterâ€™s popularity but on account of internal wrangling that resulted in the victories the APC recorded at the polls reversed by the Supreme Court in favour of the PDP. A few days after the elections were conducted and won by the APC almost in a landslide, the Supreme Court delivered a shocking judgment nullifying the elections of all the candidates of the APC from state assembly to governorship and National Assembly. The unanimous judgment of the five-man panel led by the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, declared the first runners-up in the 2019 general elections in the state as the winners of all the elections earlier declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to have been won by the APC and its candidates. Justice Paul Galinje, who read the lead judgment, had upheld the decision of the Sokoto Division of the Court of Appeal to the effect that the APC did not conduct any valid primary election and as such had no candidate for any of the elections in the state. He declared the votes polled by the APC candidates in the elections a waste. Those who thought the APC in Zamfara had learnt a lesson from the ugly experience were wrong, as all the key political actors in the state were said to have extended their bitterness to the recent jostle for ministerial tickets. The bickering among party stalwarts in the state was said to be so intense that President Muhammadu Buhari was left with no choice but to settle for the former Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, Hajiya Sadiya Umar, Farouk, who never lobbied to be a minister! Hajiya Umar was said to have got a surprise call from the President a few days to the ministerial screening at the National Assembly, asking her to submit her curriculum vitae; a development that was said to have left the feuding APC stalwarts crestfallen.
