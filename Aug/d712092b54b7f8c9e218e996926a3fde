An Akwa Ibom State High Court has sentenced Archibong Effiong Edem to seven years’ imprisonment for defrauding a government official of N28 million. The convict was arraigned by the Port Harcourt’s Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at a Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt. Edem was charged with a two-count charge of obtaining by false pretence, but the case was transferred to an Akwa Ibom State High Court in Uyo. Justice Archibong Archibong ruled that the prosecution established a case of obtaining by false pretence against the defendant through the evidence of three witnesses. He said: “The prosecution has satisfactorily proved his case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person to warrant his conviction in counts 1 and 2… The defendant is hereby found guilty as charged and is accordingly convicted on counts 1 and 2 of the charge.” But before the defendant was sentenced, the judge reportedly asked him if he had anything to say. Edem said: “It is not true that I admitted under cross examination that I collected N28 million from the petitioner. I have always told him that I will pay him his money and I will do so, if permitted.” On this premise, the defence counsel, S. A. Ngbe, prayed the court to tamper justice with mercy on age and health grounds. “Consider his age and ailing health. My lord, he is over 70 years,” he pleaded. The court sentenced Edem to seven years on each of the two counts without an option of fine. Justice Archibong ordered that the sentence run concurrently from the date of his conviction. He ordered the convict to pay the N28,234,735.00.
