Super Eagles of Nigeria forward Henry Onyekuru might not join French Ligue 1 side Monaco unless he drops his wage demands, Owngoalnigeria.com can reveal. Monaco agreed to a fee of around 14m Euros to sign him from Everton on a five-year deal but the 22-year-old who was on loan to Galatasaray last season is keen on remaining with the Turkish side who are, however, unable to sign him permanently. Everton wants a fee that will rise to around 20m Euros  for the wing forward, something that Galatasaray can’t afford due to their financial status and they propose to have him on loan again next season. The proposal was rejected by Everton despite the strong desire of Onyekuru to play for them and he is now left to accept the decision of the club to move to Monaco but presently his wage demand is preventing the move from happening. Onyekuru wants similar pay to the one he earned in Turkey last season with Monaco but the club insist on maintaining their wage structure and the standoff was responsible for his non-appearance for a planned medical last week. Talks are still ongoing between his representatives and Monaco with many expecting the move to happen this week but if the deadlock on wages remains same then Monaco will switch to other targets.
