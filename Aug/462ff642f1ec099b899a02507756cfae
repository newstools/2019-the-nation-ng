The Executive Director of Lekki British School (LBS), Mr. Christian Idehen, has urged the federal and state governments to devise a revolutionary approach to education to ensure a secure future for the coming generation. Mr. Idehen a scion of the late founder of the school, Dr. (Ms) Abiodun Laja, said with governments’ proactive support for education, schools will be able to develop and excellent academic methods and standards of teaching. Idehen, who was speaking at an interactive session with reporters in Lagos recently, described his late mother as an educationist par excellence who took calculated risks and showed the example of courage, perseverance, determination and the knack to turn impossible situations to possible. He said the new management of the school was committed to simultaneously providing an environment in which individual “is assisted to discover his or her academic potential in learning, sport and personal development.” “Our main objective is to allow each child to develop his or her unique talents within a disciplined and caring traditional British school environment,” he said. According to him, “we are continuously developing our relationship with the major colleges and professional bodies globally such as Cambridge, Lambton College, Canada and the University of Kent, among others”. Mr. Idehen assured the parents and students of the school that the enduring legacy left by his mother would be built on. He said: “We will be a failure if we maintain the legacy already built. We are going to go beyond whatever she was able to do”. He said the new directors were determined to approach the administration of the school with the same determination with which the late founder exhibited.
