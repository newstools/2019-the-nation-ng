DELTA State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has warned public office holders against corruption in the discharge of their responsibilities. According to him, government functionaries should be mindful of any manifestation of graft, impropriety and corruption, as his administration strives for a stronger state. Okowa, who spoke at the inauguration of the Boards of Delta State Capital Territory Development Agency, and Warri, Uvwie and Environs Development Agency, on Thursday in Asaba, noted that political appointees were expected to be transparent in their activities. The Delta State Capital Territory Development Agency is chaired by Ighoyota Amori and Mrs. Joan Mrakpor as Director-General. The Warri, Uvwie and Environs Development Agency is chaired by Joseph Otumara and Comrade Ovuozorie Macaulay as Director-General. Joseph Ojobu and James Obeuwou were sworn in as members of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). Okowa said: “Prudent fund management demands zero tolerance for any manifestation of graft, impropriety and corruption, and I urge you to strive to live above board and employ transparency in the conduct of all your duties as selflessness is key. “Our vision of a strong Delta is aimed at transforming the state into an inter-connected and united entity; that means we have to work hard to bring development to our people, not only to enhance their general welfare, but as a way of building sustainable peace. It is for these onerous tasks that this administration has articulated its focus for development. I, therefore, ask you to become conscious of your roles in the overall achievement of the laudable vision of this administration…”
