The police command in Adamawa State has arrested a teenage boy over a violent sexual assault on a five-year-old girl. The police told our correspondent on Monday that 16-year-old Adamu Abdullahi of Jambutu, a community in Yola North Local Government Area, took advantage of a heavy rain during the weekend to commit the act and to inflict the girl with serious injury. The girl has since been admitted at the Federal Medical Centre in Yola where she was slated for surgery. The hospital information officer, Mohammed Dodo, told our correspondent that the girl, who was admitted on Saturday, had been moved to the theatre and was being attended to by surgeons (when he was called on phone just before 3pm on Monday). Disclosing how the police got to the suspect, the Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer PPRO, DSP Sulaiman Yahaya Ngurore, said the parents of the victim took her to a sexual assault referral centre in the premises of the Adamawa State Specialist Hospital in Jimeta when they realised that her condition was bad. “When the centre found that she would need surgical operation, they transferred her to the Federal Medical Centre (in Yola) where she was admitted,” he said, adding that this drew the attention of the police. “We went for and apprehended the suspect who is now helping with investigation. We will charge him to court soon as we complete our investigation,” the PPRO said.
