Following the inauguration of the Panel to probe the crisis which erupted over land dispute between the people of Araromi Obu and Ikale(Ago Alaye), the Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has directed government officials to stop making forthwith, public comments or statements on the matter. This action became imperative in order to allow the Panel set up by Government to be dispassionate in its assignments. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant(SSA) Media and Publicity to the Governor, Ojo Oyewamide said Akeredolu believed in the sanctity of the process already put in place which underscores the need for all to avoid the path of subjudice. However, the statement said, “the directive does not in way, inhibit private suggestions from individuals to the Panel by way of Memorandum, on issues that will promote a more harmonious relationship between the affected communities”.
