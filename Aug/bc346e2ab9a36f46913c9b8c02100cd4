Two traders and a housewife, yesterday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly pouring Sniper (a banned poisonous agrochemical) into a co-tenant’s cooking water. Mrs. Sade Gbadamosi, 39, a trader; Mrs. Omowunmi Aina, 42, a housewife; and Mr. Rahman Balogun, 45, a trader, of Oke-Odo, Abule-Egba, Lagos, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge of conspiracy, breach of the peace and assault. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde alleged that the defendants committed the offence on May 3 at their home. Ayorinde said they conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by pouring the chemical into Mrs. Munirat Idris’ cooking water. The court heard that the trio “made life unbearable for the complainant over undisclosed reasons.” Magistrate B. O. Osunsanmi granted the defendants N50,000 bail with one surety each in the like sum. The case continues on September 29.
