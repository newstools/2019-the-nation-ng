Four people were killed and two others wounded when a man “full of anger” attacked people at random in two Southern California cities, The Associated Press reported. A 33-year-old man from Garden Grove, Calif. allegedly robbed over a half a dozen businesses and killed two men at the apartment complex where he lived during his two-hour spree, according to the news service. One man died inside of an apartment and another was found wounded on a balcony at the complex and later died in a hospital, it added. The suspect also killed a security guard in a convenience store in Santa Ana, Calif., where he was arrested, authorities said, adding that the attacker stole a knife and gun from the guard before he was apprehended. A male employee at a Subway restaurant was also stabbed to death during one of the robberies, according to the AP. The accused attacker’s name has not been released by authorities, the news service noted, adding that he and all of the victims were Hispanic. Garden Grove Police Lt. Carl Whitney said at a news conference the suspect seemed to be motivated by “robbery, hate, homicide,” according to the AP. He reportedly added that security footage shows the attacker was armed with “some sort of machete knives.” “We know this guy was full of anger and he harmed a lot of people tonight,” Whitney said Wednesday. “I’ve worked here for 30 years. This is the first time I’ve ever seen something like this where we have a suspect kill four people in one day and attack other people that are just innocent victims. It’s pure evil,” he added, CNN reported. A 54-year-old employee stabbed at an insurance agency is expected to survive, according to the AP. Authorities said a man pumping gas into his car at a Chevron station nearly had his nose “severed off his face.” (https://www.newsnow.co.uk)
