At the unveiling of Adron’s Lemon Friday Promo which held recently, Nollywood actress Patience Ozokwor, known as Mama G, called on the management of the estate to consider having an estate for stars, that will draw more attention to their business. Mama G said this at Lemon Friday, an annual seasonal promo by Adron Homes where clients are given discounts for land. “We should be given opportunity to buy-in to the estate rather than being only ambassadors,” she said. Actress Foluke Daramola who supported the idea said it will be a business strategy. “Adron Homes should use entertainment industry as a strategy to reach a greater majority of the populace,” Foluke said at the event which brought together A-list artistes to publicise the values of the foremost real estate company and the benefits to the public. Some other stars present at the event were Afeez Oyetoro (Saka), Broda shaggy, Princess, Sunny Danger, Funky Mallam, Tony Akposere, Kola Olaiya, Yemi Elesho, Officer Gaji and Ankara Gucchi.
