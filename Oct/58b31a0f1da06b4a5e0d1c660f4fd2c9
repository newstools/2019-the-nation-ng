Adesoji Adeniyi, Osogbo Action Alliance has charged Osun and Oyo states to find a means of resolving the lingering ownership crisis rocking the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso. In a communiqu√© jointly signed by AA Chairman, Adewole Joshua, and Secretary, Olu Omotoso, at the end of its Southwest caucus meeting, the party sympathised with staff and students of the university over the crisis. He implored them to remain calm and hopeful that the matter would be resolved soon. The meeting, which considered events after the suspension of Mr. Kenneth Udeze and Mr. James Vernimbe as National Chairman and National Secretary, respectively, praised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for honouring the position of party leadership on the suspension. Advising the suspended leaders against all forms of illegality, the meeting warned that any action by them on behalf of the party would be deemed to be an illegality.
