The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has urged residents to hold government, community and traditional leaders, to accountable to promote good governance. Bello, represented by the Minister of State for FCT, Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, gave the advice at a ceremony to mark the 59th Independence Anniversary. He stressed the need for the residents to initiate community action, galvanise and mobilise the citizenry to actualise the true ideals of the FCT. The minister also enjoined residents of the territory to insist that the right things were done and be committed to the building of  Abuja as envisaged by its founding father’s. He said the development of the FCT had not been without challenges, many of which were associated with commitment of residents to the ideals of which the territory was founded. According to him, FCT has lived up to the dreams of her founding fathers, as over the years, it has become a melting pot of cultures, traditions and people from virtually every village and hamlet in the country. He said: “Let all of us, therefore, use the occasion and opportunity of our 59th Independence Anniversary to rededicate and re-commit ourselves to building the FCT of our dreams. It will gladden me as I have no doubt it will gladden the hearts of our founding fathers because it will be the realisation of their dreams, if every resident of the FCT truly regards the territory as home and will treat here as such. “For far too long, many residents of the FCT consider her as simply a location where they live out of necessity to make a living, while their hearts lie somewhere else. “I must say that for the FCT to really make the dreams of her founders become a reality and truly become a home for all Nigerians, we must treat her the way we treat the homes in which we live daily. I have often times said that as residents of the FCT we owe ourselves and indeed the entire country to treat it as our one true home.
