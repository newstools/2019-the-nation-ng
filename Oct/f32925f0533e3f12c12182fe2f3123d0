Maagboo emerged the highest scorer of the selected winners with a cumulative of 210.5 points, while Fatai got a cumulative of 205.5 points at the end of five tasks throughout the camping period. The contest was organised by Tecno Mobile, in partnership with African Artists’ Foundation  (AAF) and National Geographic Magazine. Attai Oguche, the Deputy Marketing Manager, Tecno Nigeria, said: “At Tecno, we are excited to have started such initiative in Nigeria, in line with our Camera-centric flagship line, the Camon Series. Having just launched the Camon 12 Series, there is no better way to put the camera quality to test than to send mobile photography lovers whom we refer to as “Unlockers” on a mission to unlock the limitless camera possibilities of this device.” Also, at the event anchored by Folu Stormz and other photography enthusiasts, Director, AFF, Azu Nwagbogu, said it had been a fun journey for us at the AAF having been part of this activity from the selection of the Unlockers to the unveiling of the winner. “We cannot overemphasise the fact that Tecno has through this medium, increased conversations around the participation of budding talents in the widely growing world of mobile photography. The brand did not just create an amazing device, but also gave a platform for talents to express their skills. This is a commendable project and We hope to do this again soon.” A total of 24 participants called “the Unlockers” were selected from a long list of entries submitted for the CAMission competition, and over the course of five days with five challenging tasks, they actively contested for the grand prize from October 4 -8  using the Camon 12 Pro camera to capture wide-angle, low-light, macro and micro pictures.
