Oluwamayokun Orekoya  EFE Apochi wants to fight the top boxers in the cruiserweight division but he says they avoid him because he is dangerous. The ‘Nigerian Pitbull’ will fight journeyman Larry Pryor in an eight-round cruiser-weight contest at the Arena Theatre, Houston, Texas, USA tonight. The 31-year-old former Nigeria Amateur Boxing Team captain is targeting at least 15 fights so he can call out the big fighters in the division. “They don’t want to fight me right now they know the ‘Nigerian Pitbull’ is dangerous. I took this fight because I have to stay busy. I only have eight fights under my belt,” Apochi told NationSport in a Facebook chat. “I am targeting at least 15 fights so I can call the big fighters out,” he added. An accomplished amateur boxer in Nigeria where he captained the boxing team to a bronze-winning performance at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Apochi has knocked-out all his opponents in his eight fights since turning professional in 2017. Apochi knocked out Earl Newman in the 7th round in his last fight in Biloxi, Mississippi in May. He is trained by the legendary Ronnie Shields who also trains heavyweight prospect Efe Ajagba. Thirty seven year-old Pryor, a Frederick, Maryland native, is looking to rebound from a decision loss to Raphael Murphy in August.
