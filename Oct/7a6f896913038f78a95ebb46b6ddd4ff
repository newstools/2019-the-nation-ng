 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC from Port Harcourt zonal office, swooped on a community in Imo State and arrested no fewer than 15 suspected Internet fraudsters, popularly called ‘Yahoo’ boys. The operatives who mounted surveillance around some hostels along Nekede Polytechnic Road in Umudibia Autonomous Community in Owerri West Local Government Area of the state raided the hostels said to be hideout of the suspected cyber crime gangs. The incidence came just few weeks after the anti-graft agency from the zonal office in Enugu raided the Okwu-Uratta area of the state capital and arrested 37 suspects, and also seized cars and phones from them as well as Spibat Avenue where 25 suspects were arrested. A police source who confirmed the latest development to the Nation said the EFCC operatives had been in the state since last week. He said they swung into action on Monday morning after the state Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Ladodo, had been notified through a letter of their activity in the state. It was gathered that when the operatives of the anti-graft agency swooped the area, the suspects were in the hostel transacting their business with their laptops.
