The Lagos State government has said in view of the competing needs of the state, the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model has become an alternative to meet up with the needs. Its Head of Service (HoS), Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, who spoke during a rountable that had Creating Sustainable Development through PPPs as theme in Lagos, commended the management team of the Lagos State Public Private Partnership, and its Director-General in particular for putting together the roundtable in such a timely manner, especially at the beginning of a new year when a brand new budget cycle was unfolding. “Lagos is easily one of Africa’s most preferred investment destinations. This should not be surprising given its strategic location, population and status as Nigeria’s commercial hub and the nation’s acclaimed ‘Centre of Excellence.’ “In recognition of the need to create an environment that is conducive for investment and living, succeeding administrations in Lagos had focused on the development and implementation of several policies and initiatives aimed at ensuring sustainable socio-economic development of our dear state,” he said. He explained that these policies and initiatives include the establishment of Ministry of Wealth Creation, the Office of Transformation, Creativity and Innovation, the Lagos State Office of City Resilience, Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Agency, Light-Up Lagos Project, Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency, and One Lagos Fiesta, among others. The HoS also said the state government in partnership with the Federal Government had, two years ago, set machinery in motion designed to acheive significant improvement in the World Bank’s ranking of Nigeria on the “Ease of Doing Business Index,” which involved the review and streamlining of the business processes of about 10 critical state government agencies that were relevant to investment promotion. This has led to improvement in the country’s on the World Bank’s ranking.
