THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a 53-year-old man, Muhammed Bolaji Abdulraheem for allegedly parading himself as a lawyer. The man was also accused of obtaining money under false pretences. Abdulraheem, who was arrested by detectives from the Ilorin zone of the anti-graft agency, was also accused of using a  dubious means to defraud one Mallam Yusuf Bello of N300,000. Bello, in his petition to the Counter Terrorism and General Investigations Section of EFCC, alleged that the suspect recovered the sum of N300,000 from his debtor and claimed that the money was in the custody of the EFCC. The ‘fake lawyer’ allegedly confessed that the money was never brought to the EFCC, adding that the commission knows nothing about it. In a dramatic turn of events yesterday he destroyed his statement where he admitted that he was called to the bar and had been practicing as a legal practitioner for more than two decades. It was gathered from EfCC that the suspected fake lawyer never finished from the Nigerian Law School, and that he failed the institution’s prescribed examinations twice.
