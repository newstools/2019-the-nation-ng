The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has commiserated with leader of the defunct Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, on the death of his mother. The condolence, signed by the President-General, Chief Nnia Nwodo, reads: “Ndigbo sends you and your family our condolences on the loss of your mother, Mrs. Ugoeze Sally Kanu. We urge you to take heart and find solace in the teachings of our Lord, which gives all believers the hope that, in the end, all true believers shall unite in everlasting communion in His Kingdom. May her gentle soul rest in peace.” The group also condoled with Charles Oputa, aka Charly Boy, on the death of his mother.
