The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) appears to have finally got over the challenge of who would lead the party’s campaign for the governorship election scheduled for November 16. The party appears to have finally settled for the House of Representatives member representing Kabba/Bunu/Ijumu federal constituency after Senator Dino Melaye and the state’s former governor, Ibrahim Idris, had both rejected the party’s offer that they should become the director-general of the PDP Kogi State Governorship Campaign Council. But the stealthy manner Yusuf emerged as the director-general of Engr. Musa Wada’s campaign organization has left many tongues wagging. The party was said to have appointed Yusuf for the position without making a public show of it because of its previous experiences with Melaye and Idris. A party source in the state told Sentry that the party decided to make Yusuf’s appointment a quiet affair to avoid a situation to avoid another embarrassing situation.
