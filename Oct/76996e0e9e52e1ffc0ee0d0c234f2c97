Ahead of the November 16 Kogi governorship election, the Peoples Democratic Party has called for the transfer of the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Busari, and the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. James Apam. This was contained in the resolution of the Lokoja LGA PDP, at the end of its enlarged stakeholders meeting. According to the party, their removal will guarantee fairness, equity and justice in the election. The PDP in a communiqu√© signed by Alhaji Abubakar Idris, the Lokoja LG party chairman, warned against the deployment of Dr. Amina Zakari, INEC National Commissioner, to oversee the governorship poll in the state. It said on no condition should she be allowed to be part of the exercise. The party called for the deployment of the officers, saying their actions were no longer in the interest of credible election. The party, however, passed a vote of confidence in the Nigeria Army (Records) Command and the DSS in Lokoja, saying that it has lived up to its billings during elections. It restated its commitment to ensuring victory for the party and its candidate, Musa Wada, urging members not to rest on their oars, but work hard to seal victory for the party.
