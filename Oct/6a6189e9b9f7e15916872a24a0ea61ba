A coalition of civil society organisations yesterday stormed Lagos Assembly to complain about the perennial crisis in Lagos State University (LASU), Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) and Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (AOCOED), calling for  urgent intervention of the government to salvage the institutions. In a letter submitted to the House, which was jointly signed by the United Action for Democracy (UAD), Sahara Education Development Initiative (SEDI), Workbond International Network (WIN) and Committee for Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), the coalition stated that the dismissal of ASUU leaders prompted the peaceful rally, they appealed for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s intervention. The group demanded the reinstatement of five ASUU-LASU officials “illegally dismissed by the Prof. Bayo Ninalowo-led governing council, and the Vice Chancellor, Professor Lanre Fagbohun.” They further requested the governor to constitute a visitation panel to the institution as a matter of urgency. Other demands of the coalition included: immediate reinstatement of ASUU-LASU check-off dues illegally stopped by Lanre Fagbohun since January, 2019, immediate promotion of union officers and loyalists who were said to have been denied promotions by the university administration. They urged Governor Sanwo-Olu to “investigate N198 million pension funds of LASU staff used to buy exotic cars, and immediate investigation of the N1.3billion NEEDs funds mismanaged by Prof. Obafunwa and Fagbohun.” One of the leaders of the group, Mr. Kunle Wiseman Ajayi, said, “We will continue the protest until our demands are met. Nigerians are suffering, the country is rich yet our people are suffering. “Why are we suffering, is it that we are poor, no, a few people just sit on our money. They are wasting our resources, they are even using our resources to fight us,” he said.
