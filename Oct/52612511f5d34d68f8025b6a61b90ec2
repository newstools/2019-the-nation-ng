Tajudeen Adebanjo  THE Muslim Students Society of Nigeria (MSSN) has urged the government to improve the welfare package for teachers. This, the society said, would ensure a solid future for the country’s Education sector. The Lagos State MSSN Area Unit Amir (President) Dr Saheed Ashafa said this in a statement to commemorate World Teachers’ Day. The Amir described the current poor remuneration for teachers as unacceptable. “The importance of teachers in any society that desires all-round growth is second to none. We advocate for significantly higher pay for teachers at all levels of our educational sector. “Many teachers are suffering. Some are paid meagre salaries to the extent that they can barely transport themselves to school or feed. Some are owed salaries and lack transport to go to school to teach the pupils,” he said. Ashafa urged the government to resolve other forms of hardship being encountered by teachers. “Inhuman treatment such as traveling a far distance to schools, absence modern teaching tools, and inadequate refresher courses must be addressed by the present government,” he said. The Amir reminded the government of the importance of paying more attention to the sector. He advised teachers to eschew all forms of professional misconduct to restore the integrity and sanctity of their profession. “It should be clearly stated that the rate of examination malpractice at present is highly embarrassing. The poisonous role of many teachers in the malpractice in its present height is unpardonable. We must do everything to ensure that sanity returns to the sector,” Ashafa said.
