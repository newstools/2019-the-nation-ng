THE Director-General of GYB/CEDO Campaign Organisation in Kabba/Bunu Local Government Area of Kogi State, Hon.  Duro Meseko, has described the fence mending meeting between Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello and former deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Hon. James Faleke in Abuja as the best thing to have happened to the party in the state. Governor Bello, his Chief of Staff and running mate Chief Edward Onoja had met with Faleke at the Abuja home of the governor behind closed doors, after which they posed for photographs displaying four fingers apiece signifying additional four years for Governor Bello in Lugard House. In a statement issued yesterday, Meseko said with the coming together of the two gladiators of APC, the coast is  clear for a resounding victory for the party in the coming governorship election. “For me, the rapprochement between Governor Bello and Hon. Faleke today is one of the best things to have happened to our great party, in terms of the unity it will engender, besides other dividends that will accrue therefrom. I am indeed excited that the APC in Kogi is now a closely knit family, united for good governance. “To all the opposition parties in the state, I admonish them to look beyond the November 16 governorship election, as it is now clear more than ever before that there is no vacancy in Lugard House.”
