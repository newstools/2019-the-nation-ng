Manchester City fell eight points behind Liverpool in the title race on Sunday afternoon after suffering a shock home defeat against Wolves. Adama Traore scored twice for the visitors, sliding home two cool finishes past goalkeeper Ederson on both occasions. Manchester City lacked fluidity without the injured Kevin de Bruyne, with Gabriel Jesus’ header clawed away by Rui Patricio and Joao Cancelo shooting narrowly wide from distance. This victory has moned Wolves up to 11th place in the league following just their second league win of the season. Elsewhere, Tammy Abraham scored his eighth league goal of the season as in-form Chelsea swept aside Southampton at St Mary’s, thus climbing to fifth in the Premier League. Chelsea dominated from the outset and took the lead when Abraham’s looping finish from Callum Hudson-Odoi’s pass was adjudged to have crossed the line before Maya Yoshida’s intervention. Mason Mount doubled the Blues’ lead from close range, before Danny Ings poked home Yan Valery’s cut-back to reduce the arrears. The visitors restored their two-goal advantage five minutes before half-time, N’Golo Kante’s strike from the edge of the area taking a wicked deflection off Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg on its way past Angus Gunn. David Luiz scored the only goal as Arsenal edged past Bournemouth at Emirates Stadium to move up to third in the Premier League. Luiz glanced home Nicolas Pepe’s ninth-minute corner for his first goal since his summer arrival from Chelsea. Bournemouth improved after the break and went close through Callum Wilson, but they rarely troubled Bernd Leno in the Arsenal goal. The Gunners move above Leicester, Burnley and Crystal Palace with the win, while Bournemouth stay 10th.  BBCSports
