A traditional ruler in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, Oba Adefarakanmi Agbede, who is the Olowa of Oke, has expressed concern over the spate of insecurity in the state. Oba Agbede spoke at a seminar organised by Partners For Peace (P4P) in the Niger Delta (PIND) on the reduction of violence and criminality across the state. He tasked critical stakeholders, particularly the traditional rulers in the state, on ways to prevent crime in their various domains. The Monarch who was represented by the Director, Local Government Staff Training School, Itaogbolu, Solomon Ariyeloye, said the increasing rate of crime in the state was alarming. This he said could be attributed to the high rate of unemployment, knowing full well that an idle mind is devilâ€™s workshop. According to him, one of the ways to reduce crime is to engage the youth productively, adding that there could not be peaceful and developed community if the youths are not gainfully employed. While noting that unemployment is the major problem facing the country, he described it as the roots of moral decadence. The monarch implored his colleagues to help in promoting programmes that could be of benefits to the youths in their domain, and also engage them in productive trades. In her welcome address, the Deputy Coordinator of Partners for Peace (P4P) in Ondo State, Pastor Mrs. Yinka Odedele, said the organisation was dedicated to promoting peace in the Niger Delta states of Nigeria. She said the network was supported by Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND).
