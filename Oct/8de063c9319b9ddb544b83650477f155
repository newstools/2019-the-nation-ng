President Muhammadu Buhari has extended heartfelt condolences to the Akinfenwa family on the demise of Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa, former national chairman of Alliance for Democracy. Buhari, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, also commiserated with the government and people of Osun State on the loss of the elder statesman, who represented Osun East constituency in the National Assembly from 1999 to 2003. As a professional teacher, labour activist, politician and community leader, President Buhari believed that Senator Akinfenwa dedicated his life to the service of others; even as he worked tirelessly to promote unity and cooperation among Nigerians of different walks of life. The President prayed God almighty to comfort all who mourn the late senator and grant the soul of the departed eternal rest.
