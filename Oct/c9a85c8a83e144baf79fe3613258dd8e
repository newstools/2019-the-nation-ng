Onimisi Alao, Yola  Some men described as heavily armed have abducted four cattle breeders in Adamawa State. A source in Gurin, a town in Fufore Local Government Area where the incident happened, said the armed men stormed the place Saturday morning and took the four away. “The victims were kidnapped some four kilometres from Fufore, along the Fufore-Gurin road in the early hours of Saturday,” the source said. He added that the victims “were grazing cattle when the kidnappers whisked them away and left the cattle wandering.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, confirmed the incident. “Four were kidnapped, but the bandits freed one of them to take information home,” the PPRO said. Kidnapping appears to be on the increase in Adamawa State after an apparent lull upon the inauguration of Rt Hon Ahmadu Fintiri as governor. Fintiri had blazed in after inauguration on May 29, warning all shades of criminals to keep away from the state. While his anti-crime moves appear to have tamed young gangs of thieves called Shilla Boys, kidnappers appear to have reinvented their old ways. Only last Saturday, they abducted a Professor of Soil Science, Adamu Zata, from his residence near his workplace, the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH), and released him on Wednesday after his family paid ransom in amount not disclosed at the time
