Former presidential candidate in the last general elections Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his victory at the Supreme Court. He said with the pronouncement, it was time to move the nation forward. Olawepo-Hashim, who ran an essentially issue based campaign, said in Lagos that the problem with Nigeria required a collective effort beyond partisan politicking. According to him going into the immigration of any country attracts the collective identity of the Nigerian as against being identified because of local party affiliation. His words: “We are first and foremost Nigerians, before we are identified as a member of one party or the other. The important thing, therefore, is to build a nation where we can all be collectively proud.” Easily seen as one of the few cerebral politicians in the clime, Olawepo-Hashim stressed Nigerians have played much of partisan politics and what we do need now is unity amongst the political elites. “Our situation needs urgent attention, through a unity of political leaders” Olawepo-Hashim stated, stressing “We require collective wisdom to take our nation out of the woods. Victory at the court should not be seen as an end in itself, but as a means to an end The business man added: “Mr. President should be magnanimous in victory, while the losers should also be gallant in defeat. There are many challenges bedeviling our political and electoral processes, and all hands have to be on deck to resolve them, in the interest of the growth of our democracy.”
