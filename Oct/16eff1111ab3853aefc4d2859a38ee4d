In a few hours, the winner of the 2019 Big Brother Naija “Pepper Dem” season will be announced. Five housemates have made it all through to the 99th day of the reality show. They are Frodd, Omashola, Mercy, Seyi and Mike. They survived all tasks, controversies, strategies, nominations and evictions en-route to the final, beating 20 other housemates to make it this far. Major highlights of the season include victories in the veto power game of chance, which gave a housemate the power to save one nominated housemate for eviction, replacing with another, the various Thursday evening task presentations and  Friday night Bet9ja arena games. There was also the multiple tasks Big Brother gave the housemates sponsored by brands of the show. There were also relationships created with Frodd and Esther as well as Mercy and Ike stealing the ‘love show’ this season. It is also impossible to shy away from the many fights recorded with Tacha, at the centre of many of them, leading to her eventual disqualification. It remains to be seen who will be crowned the winner of the show, joining champions like Miracle Igbokwe who won in 2018 and Efe Ejeba, the winner in 2017. There are speculations that with Tacha’s disqualification from the show ten days ago, the winner would be between Mike and Mercy. But it is a known fact that nothing is certain till it happens with Big Brother.
