 THE Police on Friday released the names of successful candidates in the 2019 recruitment exercise. The announcement appears to be in defiance of a recent ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja, that the Police and the Police Service Commission should stay action on the recruitment pending the determination of a suit filed by the force against the PSC on the matter. A tweet on the Nigeria Police verified Twitter handle @PoliceNG monitored by The Nation yesterday reads: “List of successful candidates in the 2019 recruitment exercise into the Nigeria Police Force, 24th October, 2019. ”The IGP has vetted and given approval for the release of the final and authenticated list of successful candidates who participated in the ongoing recruitment exercise into the Nigeria Police Force. Below is the list of successful candidates: https://www.npf.gov.ng/information/index.php” In the link, under general instructions, the successful candidates were asked to report at the police colleges/training schools indicated against their states. The training and documentation shall commence on Monday, October 28 and closes on Friday, November 1. Failure to report for training within the stipulated time will mean that the candidate has declined the offer.
