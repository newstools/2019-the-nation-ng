The NYSC made this known in a statement on Friday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. The organisation asked the foreign-trained graduates concerned to report at the NYSC headquarters on Monday in Abuja. “Foreign-trained Ex-Corps Members who participated in the recently concluded 2018 Batch C, Stream l Service Year with questionable degrees from Universities in Benin Republic and some other African Countries, and have not been issued Certificate of National Service (CNS) to present themselves for further scrutiny. “Those concerned are to report at NYSC National Directorate HQ, Abuja from Monday 14th October, 2019,” the statement said.
