James Azania, Lokoja  THE running mate to the late Prince Abubakar Audu in the 2015 Kogi governorship election, Hon. James Faleke, has confirmed that he will support the re-election bid of Governor Yahaya Bello in the November 16 poll. Pictures of Faleke and Bello, together with his running mate, Chief Edward Onoja, taken together in Abuja, went viral earlier yesterday. Faleke said it was true that he had agreed to support Bello’s re-election bid, adding: “Yes, following the decision of the leadership of Audu/Faleke group to work with the governor, and as loyal party men and women, I on behalf of the group, met the governor to chart the way forward and build a strong and united All Progressives Congress (APC), before the election.” “We have put all issues in the past. I will be in a better position to always assist and advise the party and government in the state to execute people friendly programmes,” he said. Faleke said since he had returned to Lagos, it would be bad of him not to align the members of the Audu/Faleke group with the government and the main politics of the state. “It is, therefore, necessary as loyal party members to assist, by bringing the party faithful who have been with me through thick and thin in the last four years, to the governor. “By God’s grace, we will arrange to hand them over at a future meeting, as soon as possible. Although I have no vote in Kogi, I have numerous followers in the state. “Let us be clear that although I have no vote in Kogi State, I have massive followership and have a strong voice, which will be seen in the outcome of the elections,” he said. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mohammed Onogu, said in a statement that the decision was arrived at during a meeting between Faleke and the governor and his running mate, Onoja.
