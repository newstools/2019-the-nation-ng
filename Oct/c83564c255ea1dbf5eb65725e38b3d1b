 TWENTY-year-old Laide Arikewuyo, one of the 108 girls rescued from an illegal rehabilitation centre in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, has said that she was turned into a sex machine by the children and relatives of the owner of the centre, Mallam AbdulRaheem Owotutu. The Kwara State Police Command had on Thursday paraded the ladies, men and children it rescued from the rehab centre located in Gaa’Odota in the metropolis. Narrating her ordeal, Miss Arikewuyo accused those charged to supervise the inmates of acts that bordered on sexual misdemeanor. She said it was her parents who took her to Mallam Owotutu’s camp. She said: “I was brought to Mallam Owotutu by my parents when they eventually found me from where I absconded to. “I decided to run away from home when my parents were no longer catering for my living again, and I was brought to Mallam’s camp by my parents when they found me. “I have been living in the Mallam’s camp over five years ago.” “I was regularly having sex with some of the Mallam children and other relatives; no fewer than five people who were engaged to supervise us in the camp. “I remember that I had pregnancy at three different times, which they always gave me some medicines to use for the pregnancy not to stay.” Also painting his unsavory stay at the centre was one Tope Collins Owonifaari, who said that some unknown persons picked him up in Lagos and he eventually found himself at the centre’s unhygienic environment where all were indiscriminately lumped together. He said: “I was picked up inside a commercial bus in Lagos around 4 am on the 20th of October 2019, by unknown people, and I could not say precisely how I found myself in the midst of many people, some of whom were even lunatics, and kept in a particular custody without having access to sunlight.” He added that he had only spent four days in the camp before the police came to their rescue.
