Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has said that the current National Assembly, especially the House of Representatives will champion the course of a better deal for Nigerian teachers. In his solidarity message to Nigerian Teachers as they celebrate World Teachers Day, and signed by his Special Adviser Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker called for an improved welfare package for the Nigerian teachers. Gbajabiamila said with the tremendous task of teaching future leaders, Nigerian teachers deserve the best from governments at all levels as well as other well-meaning Nigerians and assured that the National Assembly would ensure that the welfare of Nigerian teachers is well taken care of through adequate legislation and relevant resolutions. He said that against the backdrop of decades old cliché that ‘the reward of teachers is in heaven,’ the reward of the Nigerian teachers should begin to manifest here on earth.
The Speaker encouraged young Nigerians to take up teaching as it is the only profession that can mould leaders of tomorrow in different ways. He said: “Today, I join millions of Nigerians to commemorate this great day, the World Teachers’ Day. I salute the determination, diligence and dedication of the Nigerian teacher. But for the teacher, we all may not have been moulded to become what we have become today. “I therefore call for concerted efforts to better the lives of the Nigerian teachers. We all have the responsibility to make our teachers happy, and I make bold to say that the 9th National Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, would champion the course of the Nigerian teachers. “Working closely with the Executive arm of government, I believe in the next four years, we will put more smiles on the faces of the Nigerian teachers. “May I use this occasion to encourage the Nigerian youth to take up teaching and produce good leaders that will take the country to the promised land”.
