Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin Trade Union Congress (TUC) has threatened a showdown with the Kwara state government over alleged ongoing distribution of performance assessment forms to civil servants in the state. TUC alleged that the forms contain questions for its members to assessment the performance of labour movement in the state. It specifically stated that the ‘performance assessment forms’ emanated from the office of the state Head of Service (HoS) Susan O. Oluwole. Kwara state TUC Comrade Kolawole Olumoh in an exclusive chat with THE NATION said: “It is unfortunate that the office of the Kwara state Head of Service (HoS) has not deemed it fit to summon the labour movement to a meeting as regards the ongoing distribution of forms to our members to assess our performance. “The labour movement in the state believes that the action is politically-motivated and it will be very detrimental to the relationship between the unions and the state government. We as labour leaders we are elected constitutionally and we have the mandate to represent the interest of our teaming members. To us, we are seeing the head of service action as a backstabbing and act of indictment on us. We are surely going to take an action on it. We will not take it lightly. We are embarrassed by the action.” His Joint Negotiating Council (JNC) in the state Sulaiman Saliu said that “the HoS has no constitutional right to be sending out questionnaires pertaining to labour activities in the state. When we saw the form we looked as indictment. If we are not reacting to some of the things they are doing that does not mean we are stupid, but we have been trying to manage the relationship between labour and the state government. “But the way they are going now they want to see the other side of labour movement in the state. We are condemning the action of the head of service in totality, because I don’t know what kind of policy they are making on our behalf without consulting us. We are not accepting it.”
