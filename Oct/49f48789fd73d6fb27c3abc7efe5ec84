THE Enugu State Police Command has arrested a 75-year-old security guard, who allegedly defiled an 11-year-old girl on a school premises. The command’s Public Relations Officer Ebere Amaraizu said in a statement on Tuesday that the suspect was caught in the act by a good Nigerian on August 30. Amaraizu said that the suspect wanted to influence the good Nigerian not to bring up the alleged nefarious act. He said that the suspect committed the alleged offence in one of the structures at the Community Secondary School, Ugbaike in Igbo Eze Local Government Area. Amaraizu said, “Just as the scriptural saying goes that one’s sin shall find him out, the iniquity of the man has found him out. “The 75-year-old man was nabbed over alleged defilement of  11-year-old. “It was gathered that the incident took place in one of the structures at the Community Secondary School, Ugbaike,” he said. According  to the police spokesman, the suspect has been asking for forgiveness, claiming  that Satan led him into the  crime. “The suspect is now helping the police in their investigation,” he added.
