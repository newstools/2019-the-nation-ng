Kehinde OLULEYE It has been one celebration or another since the turn of this week as Yinka Badejo, the stylish wife of former General Overseer of The Foursquare Gospel Church, Dr. Wilson Adebogun Badejo, turned 70. Mrs Yinka Badejo has been all smiles and party ready as members of the Christian fold from different Christian organisations have been hosting and treating her to different kinds of receptions, to honour her. At 70, Yinka Badejo is still glowing with radiance and leading the women folk with a praying ministry. Sheâ€™s still as restless as ever and still going from one Christian event to another. But that much should be expected of her since her husband, who also turned 70 few years ago, has also not retired.
