Eight people carrying a relation for burial have died in a crash on the Numan-Yola road in Adamawa State. Our correspondent gathered on Thursday that the accident occurred around Afcott, a company near Ngurore in Yola South Local Government, on Wednesday. About 14 people reportedly sustained injuries. Sources said the accident involved vehicles, including the one with people conveying a body from Jada towards Guyuk, which was hit by a Starlet car trying to overtake it. A witness said: “The car overtook the vehicle carrying the body. The driver did not know that there was an oncoming Toyota Corolla car. The Starlet and the Toyota coming from the opposite direction were on top speed. Before the Starlet driver could slam on the brakes, the accident occurred.” The Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mohammed Hussaini, confirmed the accident. He said it was caused by reckless driving. The government said in a statement that the victims were mostly members of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN), an indigenous church to which a large number of Adamawa Christians belong. The statement, signed by the Director-General, Media and Communications, Mr. Solomon Kumangar, said Governor Ahmadu Fintiri described the accident as sad. He commiserated with the bereaved family, prayed that God would grant rest to the soul of the departed and speedy recovery to the injured.
