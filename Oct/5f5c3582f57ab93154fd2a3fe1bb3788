By Nwanosike Onu, Awka The absence of Justice Babatunde Quadri, of Federal High Court 2 in Awka, Anambra State, has stalled hearing in the suit involving the detained students of Madonna University, Okija. Six students and a lecturer were arrested and detained on the orders of the school for seven months before they were granted bail in July. They were accused of criticising the school on social media. On the date they made bail, the matter was adjourned till October 7. However, the judge was absent as he was said to have travelled outside the state. But lawyers were told to pick a date and December 3 was agreed as the next adjourned date. A lawyer, Chinedu Igwe, said they were working to ensure the matter ended well. On allegations that the school was trying to frustrate the suspects by withholding their degree, Igwe said it was one of the issues they would raise when the court resumed.
