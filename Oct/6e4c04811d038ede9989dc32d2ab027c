We do due diligence before clamping down on them. “I have also mentioned that we are making arrangement to rehabilitate these arrested fraudsters so that they can be useful to the society,” he said.

He said his administration was working very hard with the office of the Inspector General of Police (IG) to ensure that attacks on motorists plying the Ore-Benin Highway were a thing of the past. Obaseki said: “Our model for community policing is key and we are working very hard with the IG’s office. Do not forget that the current IG was AIG in Edo State and that was when we started working on the whole concept of community policing. “That is one of the reasons I am here; to work with the senior management of the police in terms of providing security in the state.”
