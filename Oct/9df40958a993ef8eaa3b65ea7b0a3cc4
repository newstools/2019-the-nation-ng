 FIFTY youths were at the weekend trained in digital marketing by the Chairman of Ifako-Ijaye Local Government Area of Lagos State, Apostle Oloruntoba Oke, as part of his commitment to reducing youth unemployment. The training, which was part of the council chairman’s campaign promises on capacity development, was designed to teach the youth areas such as Search Engine Optimisation, Social Media Branding, Video Marketing, Social Media Marketing, and Google Advert, among others. Oke said the programme was part of efforts to depopulate the congested labour market. “This is part of our efforts at reducing youth unemployment; we want to make sure the youths are self-employed because white collar jobs are no longer there. “We had one training just two weeks ago, and we are going to be having another one in four weeks’ time. After the training, we would empower the youths with necessary tools to work with. The next one will be training on phone repairs, then, we will equip them with necessary kits. We will ensure our people no longer need to go to Computer Village at Ikeja, anymore for phone repair and this will increase our IGR”, the chairman said. He admonished the beneficiaries to take advantage of the training programme by utilising the knowledge gained to become self-reliant.
