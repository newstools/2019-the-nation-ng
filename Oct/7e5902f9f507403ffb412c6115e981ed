Super Eagles German coach, Gernot Rohr has offered felicitation and salutation to Nigeria and indeed fans of the national team on the occasion of the country’s 59th Independence Day Anniversary which was celebrated on Tuesday. Rohr definitely shares so many things in common with Nigeria’s anniversary month. Apart from resigning his coaching appointment as manager of Niger’s national football team in October 2014, the former Bayern Munich defender actually made history on 7th October 2017 when his Nigeria-led team became the first African side to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup after a 1–0 win against Zambia in Uyo. “Nigeria at 59? That’s a great anniversary,” the 66-year-old Rohr who has supervised the country’s 45 international matches told NationSport exclusively. “Today, Nigeria can be proud of freedom and democracy.” Under Rohr, the Super Eagles have won an impressive 26 matches; drew 10 and lost 9. Apart from qualification for Russia 2018 World Cup, the Super Eagles also made it to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) where his young side won the bronze medal. “The youthfulness of the Super Eagles is the mirroring of the nation,” Rohr noted in his goodwill message. Meanwhile, Rohr has disclosed that he might be forced to name a replacement for injured Super Eagles’ newly capped Joe Aribo ahead of the eagerly awaited international friendly against Brazil in Singapore on 13th October.
