Agency Reporter Kemi Williams (32), a housewife, who alleged that her husband, Femi Williams, deserted her for three years on Tuesday asked an Ado-Ekiti Customary Court to dissolve their 7-year-old marriage. The plaintiff also is seeking the dissolution on grounds of alleged constant beating, chasing her out of the house at any slightest misunderstanding and lack of care for their only child by Femi. Kemi, who resides at No 21, Oke-Ila Str., Ado-Ekiti, told the court that she had been estranged from her husband since 2017. She also told the court that her estranged husband told her that her mother in-law wanted them to be separated for not being able to give birth to another child. The plaintiff explained that she had to leave her husband’s house since his mother in-law had previously come to remove her husband’s belongings while she was still living with him. Kemi said since her husband had maltreated her severally and told her that he was no longer interested in marrying her, the court should grant her request for dissolution of the marriage. The petitioner, however, urged the court to grant custody of their four-year old child to her in order for her husband to take up the child’s responsibility as regards his welfare. The President of the Court, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, who said the court’s records showed that Femi had not been appearing in court, adjourned the case until Jan. 9, 2020 for to enable him defend the allegations.(NAN
