AS the six girls of Engravers College, Kaduna and their two teachers remain in captivity, their abductors have jettisoned the initial  N50 million ransom they demanded for the release of the abductees. The Nation gathered that the kidnappers now want N10 million for each of the  girls and their teachers. They are also said to have resorted to contacting families of the girls and the teachers to ask for the N10 million for each of them. An official of the school told our correspondent on Monday that the kidnappers have abandoned collective negotiation, preferring to deal with individual families. “They said they don’t want collective bargain again,” the staff said. “They said every parent should pay N10 million and collect his child.” The schoolgirls and their teachers were abducted from the boarding school premises in the early hours of Thursday last week. Vice Principal Administration, Mr. Shunom Giwa who witnessed the attack said, the kidnappers were five youngmen bearing sophisticated weapons.
