A leading environmental consultancy company, Ampak Nigeria Ltd (ANL), has partnered the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) to sensitise people on the importance of imbibing good environmental management practices. The participants cleaned up Otunba Jobi Fele Way in Alausa, Ikeja. Highlighting the company’s commitment towards waste management practices, the Executive Director, Mrs. Kemi Ajakaiye, in her address to volunteers and participants, said waste collection and disposal was just one fraction of the enormous, yet crucial responsibility of managing the environment. She said waste management should be targeted at ensuring resource efficiency through the application of sustainable solutions that minimise waste generation, while maximising opportunities for reuse, recycling and regeneration of resources. Ajakaiye hailed the LAWMA management, who graced the event with 15 representatives, for their efforts in working towards a cleaner and healthier Lagos. She presented the organisation with cleaning tools such as rakes, scrubbing brushes, hand gloves, nose masks and trash bags as a gesture to support its efforts. The clean-up exercise is driven by three of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – Good Health and Well-Being (Goal 3), Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal11).
