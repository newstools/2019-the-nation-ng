A former deputy governor of Akwa Ibom, Ambassador Etim Okpoyo, has waded into the crisis rocking the traditional institution in Oro nation, the third largest ethnic group in the state. Traditional rulers in Oro nation under the aegis of Council of Oro Traditional Rulers (COTR) have been having leadership crisis for some years now, thereby threatening the peace, unity and stability of the people. The elders also warned the parties against taking the matter to the social media, noting that such has greatly affected the peaceful resolution of the five-year-old crisis. These were parts of the resolutions contained in the communiqué issued at the end of a meeting attended by traditional, religious and political leaders of the Oro nation, which was made available to our correspondent in Uyo, the state capital. The communiqué which was signed by Okpoyo, a former ambassador to Italy, lamented that despite sincere intentions by the various committees to resolve the crisis in the past, there was no meaningful head way. According to the communiqué, the stakeholders, however, expressed appreciation that the frank contributions of all concerned in the dispute, amicable resolutions of all contending issues are already in sight. “The meeting called on parties to withdraw all pending matters in court and with the police for a peaceful settlement in line with this resolution. It further warned parties against taking the matter to social media, which has contributed greatly to the escalation of the crisis.”
