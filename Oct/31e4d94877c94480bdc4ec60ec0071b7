 SACRIFICIAL leadership and the right family values inculcated early will curb criminality among youths, and check Nigeria’s governance challenges. This was the submission of Pastor Yinka Ojo of Grace Family International Church on Tuesday at a pre-convention briefing in Lagos ahead of the four-day convention of the church beginning on Thursday. The theme of the convention is: ‘Like a rushing wind, Acts 2’. He said no developed nation has risen out of the kind of problems “we find ourselves in to become developed without sacrificial leaders, leaders with vision, they must sacrifice. “Politics is not job or career, it is service, for instance the US President, Donald Trump is an example of a sacrificial leader for his country, since he became president he has not collected a single month salary, he donates it to pensioners and said he would do that through out his tenure; because he realises that there are people who need that money more than him. “That kind of spirit we need it among all the people in the executive, legislature, judiciary and all levels of leadership in the country,” he said. The man of God also said there is a major failure on the family front “the kind of values that Africans treasure are no longer to be found today, no parent has time today to sit down and teach their children values, African values and culture. “There is failure of spending time with the children, moulding their mind and shaping the way they think so that they can live right in the future; many children are raising themselves, some on the streets and that is why there is so much criminality among them”, he said.
