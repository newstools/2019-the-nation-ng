By Daniel Adeleye A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Stanley Osifo, has thrown his weight behind the federal government’s plan to reintroduce tollgate across the nation’s highways. Speaking in Benin on Saturday, Edo State capital, Osifo noted that the government realised that Nigerians need to have good and accessible roads and the funds generated from the toll plazas can be used to maintain the roads. He enjoined federal government to engage in proper research to ensure that mismanagement and misappropriation of funds that led to the failure of the toll under former President Olusegun Obasanjo administration does not replicate itself. “The tolls this time around should not just be a toll plaza or toll collection centre. In terms of efficiency, I want to see the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, and his team doing something that everyone can see that the purpose, intent and also result will be of great benefit to Nigerians,” he stressed.
