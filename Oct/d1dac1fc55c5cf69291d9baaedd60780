James Azania, Lokoja  The Director General (DG) of the Bello/Onoja Campaign Organisation, Senator Smart Adeyemi, has assured voters in Kogi state will reject the attempt by families to colonise the state through the backdoor at the November 16 governorship election. According to him, the emergence of Engr. Musa Wada, an in-law to former Governor Ibrahim Idris and younger brother to the immediate past governor, Capt. Idris Wada, as the PDP governorship candidate, was an affront and attempt by them to colonise the state. He said that the people of the state have unanimously rejected the attempt through the ballot in the coming election. Addressing an enlarged crowd at the NUJ Press Centre in Lokoja, on Friday, he described Engr. Wada as alien to the problems and challenges of the state and unfit to be the next governor. “For instance, Engr. Musa Wada has not been on ground since the inconclusive primary which threw him up as PDP’s flag bearer. How will he know the problems and challenges in the state, let alone proferring solutions to them?” he asked. He called on the PDP to stop laying blame on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), for its woes during its primary of August 29, where gunmen disrupted the exercise. “I will advise PDP to look inward; as they are the ones breeding thugs and brigands right from when they were in power in the state. “The APC under the leadership of Governor Bello has no room for thuggery. All those who engaged in thuggery under PDP have now repented having been gainfully employed,” he said. He berated the PDP candidate for allegedly playing the ethnic card by saying that only the people of Kogi East could determine who the next governor of Kogi will be. He said that such statement coming from somebody who is aspiring to lead a multiethnic state as Kogi is not acceptable, adding it means he was out of touch with the reality, as the people of the state have moved on and away from such parochial sentiments.
