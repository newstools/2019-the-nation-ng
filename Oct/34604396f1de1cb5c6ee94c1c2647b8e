SINCE he sacked about 250 special assistants and other aides early in the month, the siege appears not over yet for Governor Godwin Obaseki’s appointees in Edo State. Many of them are still jittery and have resorted to organising solidarity rallies in support of the governor to prove their loyalty. Even the local government chairmen and councillors are not left out in the race to please Governor Obaseki in words and action. They have joined the fray for solidarity rallies because the governor is said to be suspecting that many of them are loyal to his godfather turned foe, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. To prove that they are loyal, they “mobilise” their supporters to sing and dance in towns and villages in their constituencies, alluding to Obaseki’s superlative performance and why he deserves to be re-elected next year. They denounce politicians within and outside the state who are against the Governor. The rally is filmed and the video sent to Government House, Benin, for the Governor to view. Woe betides any official whose loyalty is in doubt and refuses to disprove it in “such a convincing manner.”
