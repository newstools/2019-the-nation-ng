A  councillor and Majority Leader of Sapele Local Government Legislative Arm, Delta state Chief Venture Kagbude, has been reportedly shot dead by suspected assassins. It was gathered that the tragic incident occurred at about 6 pm on Tuesday along the Sapele/Effurun/Warri Road. Chief Kagbude, was the Chairman of Okirighre community in Sapele council area, as well as the chairman of the Host Communities of Nigeria Producing Oil and Gas (HOSTCOM), in the local government area, until his death. According to reports, the deceased was returning from Okuoke community located along the said road, where he had gone to inspect a house under construction for his mother. Unfortunately, the unknown gunmen waylaid and shot him dead. Director of the Asaba and Osubi International Airport, Austin Ayemidejor, while reacting to Kagbude’s death said, “it is sad news, a young man dreams to build a better society and is cut short by gunmen. He will surely be missed”. However, an undisclosed source related to the victim claimed that the late lawmaker was one of the frontiers against cultism and ritual activities in the area, adding that his demise must have resulted from his efforts, alongside the LGA chairman, “against cultism few months ago. I am sure his death must have come from there.” A senior police officer at the Sapele Police Area Command, name withheld, confirmed the development, stating that a search for the killers has commenced. But efforts to get official comments from the Delta State Police Command proved abortive, as repeated calls to the State Police Commissioner, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, mobile phone were not answered as at the time of filing this report.
