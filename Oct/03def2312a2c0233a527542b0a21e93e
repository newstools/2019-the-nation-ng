Efetobor ‘Nigerian Pitbull’ Apochi will climb back into the ring tomorrow at the Arena Theatre, Houston, Texas, USA as he takes on journeyman Larry Pryor. The 31 year-old Ughelli-born boxer is confident Pryor would not last more than four rounds in the scheduled eight-round bout. “This fight should be over by the 4th round. He is no match for my ferocity and punching power. “The fight will surely end early despite Pryor’s experience because the ‘Nigerian Pitbull’ plays rough,” Apochi told NationSport in a Facebook chat. An accomplished amateur in Nigeria where he captained the boxing team to a bronze-winning performance at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Apochi has knocked-out all his opponents in his Eight fights since turning professional in 2017. Apochi knocked out Earl Newman in the 7th round in his last fight in Biloxi, Mississippi in May. He is trained by the legendary Ronnie Shields who also trains heavyweight prospect Efe Ajagba. Pryor, 37, a Frederick, Maryland native, is looking to bounce back from a decision loss to Raphael Murphy in August. He has won 11 out of 32 fights since he began professional boxing in 2005 and has lost the remaining 22.
