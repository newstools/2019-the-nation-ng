Music superstar, David Adeleke famously known as Davido on Tuesday night, okayed the release of two sisters who accused him of impregnating one of them days after he welcomed his baby. Davido, after seeing the video where he was called out by the sisters, vowed to arrest them and make them face the law. He immediately announced a reward of N1million to anyone who could locate the sisters.  The sisters, after hearing of the bounty placed on them, quickly made another video where they claimed to be one of Davido’s biggest fans, stating the earlier video was only to get his attention. A video that surfaced on Tuesday, revealed that the sisters were arrested, and were handcuffed. Davido, who has been receiving numerous plea messages from his fans since the arrest video surfaced, requested for the release of the sisters. He said “Fuck it, release the idiots”
