Nduka Chiejina and Collins Nweze  THE 12 banks sanctioned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for failing to meet the 60 per cent Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) by September 30, will lose at least N67.4 billion annual interest on the sterilised N499.17 billion cash. President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Uche Olowu, who stated this yesterday, said the amount represents 13.5 per cent minimum interest on the deposits, which is the CBN Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). He said by using the stick approach, the regulator has also shown the banks that it can bite. “The sanction is an indication that when the CBN tells banks to do something, it must be taken seriously. I still believe that the CBN may release the funds to the banks when they meet the new 65 per cent LDR target. The good thing is that the funds still counts for the banks’ liquidity ratio,” Olowu said. Former Executive Director, Keystone Bank, Richard Obire, said getting the banks to lend more requires certain policy decisions on the part of the CBN, including crashing the Treasury Bills (T-Bills) rates. He said: “If the banks do not find the T-Bills attractive investment plan, they will be forced to lend to the real sector.” The 12 affected banks are: Citibank (N100,743,055, 321); First Bank of Nigeria (N74,668,880,480); FBNQuest Merchant Bank (N2, 697,456,144); First City Monument Bank (FCMB), (N14, 371,064, 742) and Guaranty Trust Bank (N25, 147, 933, 628). Others are Jaiz Bank (N7, 525, 165,552); Keystone Bank (N4, 162, 938, 879); Rand Merchant Bank (N2, 823,177,399); Standard Chartered Bank (N30,027,137,984); SunTrust Bank (N1,703,205,427); United Bank for Africa (N99,676,181,916) and Zenith Bank (N135,629,337,625). The CRR is a portion of the banks’ deposits kept with the CBN for regulatory reasons. The apex bank, on July 3, 2019, directed banks to maintain a minimum Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 60 per cent by September 30, 2019. The LDR, which was being reviewed quarterly to improve lending to the real sector, was 58.5 per cent as at May. It has now been raised to 65 per cent for the last quarter of the year. Banks say they have increased lending to their customers by N860 billion within the last 11 weeks. Speaking at the Bankers’ Committee meeting in Abuja, Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, hinted that the bulk of the banks’ lending was to retail and mortgage sectors. Managing Director of Citi Bank, Akin Daudu, said banks have increased lending by N860 billion in 11 months to support economic growth and investments. The bankers, when asked how they managed to be debited N499 billion for not meeting the lending threshold, said the debit was not a punishment but a nudge by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to get them to lend to more businesses. The bankers said they were delighted that “there is an increase in the flow of credit to preferred sectors of the economy as a result of the policies of CBN that compels banks to raise their LDR to at least 60 per cent before the end of September 2019.” According to them, they were able to secure CBN’s support to guarantee recovery of loans to some vulnerable sectors. They said: “We are mindful of the fact that there are some vulnerable sectors that we would be lending to. It is important for us to make sure that we mitigate our risks and have a credit fault default clause that allows us to set off the obligations of defaulting party against any other monies that defaulting party has in the industry. “It is important for all of us to include that provision in our loan agreements and the CBN is supportive in ensuring that where there is a need for us to enforce that clause, it would be enforceable.”
