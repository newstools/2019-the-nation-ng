Eight of a number of people carrying a deceased relation for burial have died in a road crash along the Numan-Yola Road in Adamawa State. Our correspondent gathered on Thursday that the accident occurred around Afcott, a company near Ngurore, in Yola South Local Government Area, on Wednesday. About 14 people were said to have sustained injuries. Sources said the accident involved a number of vehicles, including one with people conveying a corpse from Jada towards Guyuk, which was hit by a Starlet car trying to overtake it. According to a witness, “The Starlet started to overtake the corpse-bearing vehicle without knowing of an oncoming Toyota Corrola. Both the Starlet and the Toyota coming from the opposite direction were on top speed. Before the starlet could brake, the accident occurred.” The Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Adamawa State, Mohammed Hussaini, confirmed the accident, describing it as being a result of reckless driving. A reaction to the accident by the state government, obtained Thursday, indicated that the victims were mostly members of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN), an indigenous church to which a large number of Adamawa Christians belong. A press statement from the Government House, Yola, quoted Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri as noting that six of the victims were Bonetem Diocese members of the LCCN who died in the accident while going for a funeral. The statement which was signed by the Director General, Media and Communications, Mr Solomon Kumangar, said the governor described the deceased as a great loss not only to the bereaved families and the Church but Adamawa State in general. The governor prayed that God would grant rest to the soul of the departed and speedy recovery to those in hospital.
