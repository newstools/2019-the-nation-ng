Chelsea hotshot Tammy Abraham looks set to reject Nigeria and commit his future to England – if the striker gets called up for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers. Gareth Southgate has been monitoring the in-form Blues star, 21, in a bid to ensure the Three Lions don’t lose the hot prospect. Abraham’s dad is close friends with the president of the Nigeria Football Federation and he could yet choose the African nation. However, it is now believed Abraham will put all speculation to bed and commit to England should he get the call from Southgate. England take on Czech Republic and Bulgaria in their Euro 2020 qualifiers later this month. And Southgate will name his squad Thursday – with Abraham widely tipped for a call-up. Abraham has been capped twice by England – both under Southgate. But both matches were friendlies, against Germany and Brazil in 2017. Southgate even sent his No2 Steve Holland to watch Chelsea lose 1-0 to Valencia in the Champions League – with explicit orders to keep tabs on Abraham. Abraham has scored seven Premier League goals this season – including a stunning hat-trick against Wolves and two apiece against Sheffield United and Norwich.
