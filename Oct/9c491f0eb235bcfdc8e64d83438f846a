Justina Asishana, Minna  The Niger state police command has arrested a 35-year-old man, Ahmed Isah for engaging in anal sex with under-aged boys. Isah who lives in Sarkin-Pawa in Munya Local Government Area of Niger State was arrested after a man reported to the police that Isah lured his eight-year-old Cousin into his room to have intercourse with him through his anus. The suspect confessed to have been engaging in anal sex with under-aged boys between eight and ten years because he wanted to satisfy himself. According to him, he lures his victims with sweets, coke, and biscuits after the act of sodomy in order to keep them quiet and have not made any of them tell their parents about the act. He confessed that he had been involved in the act for the past three years adding that he was involved in the act because he did not have money to give to girlfriends who make huge demands on him in the course of the relationship. “I resorted to the act because I do not have money to give to women after sex and they are not willing to give it to me free of charge hence I resorted to having sex with under-aged boys in my area. “My girlfriends and I separated long ago because I do not give them money after sex, they deserted me, saying that they will not give it to me for free.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar who paraded the suspect on Tuesday urged parents to instill confidence in their children and educate them on the dangers of submitting themselves to such dehumanizing act. “We need to build the confidence of the children so that they can tell their parents anything or any challenge they are facing at any time. It is unfortunate and sad that a child will face such a situation without telling his parents”.
