ACTRESS and producer Omoni Oboli is happy with the positive feedbacks from fans on her new movie, ‘Love Is A War.’ The movie was released last month and Omoni could not hide her excitement as she posted on Instagram. “I’m a happy woman,” she wrote. “I really am! Thank you for all the reviews of #LoveIsWarFilm. I won’t get tired of them. I honestly wish I could post all the reviews.” A fan, Aminatabigail, wrote: “Maami am short of words. So there are still great stories like this. What impress me the most is the creating character aspect. You defined the setting used, your 5w and h was there, your pattern was there, specialization of the characters was there, you defined the character goal and purpose, you give the attitude, you give your character a quirk, also house the character, you brought out the fears and weaknesses of the characters and you associate your character with animals. “Ma I must say you did a wonderful job and you deserved an award for this. #loveisawar is a movie well told and organized. Thank you for bringing such a wonderful story and your cast did extremely wonderful. You are indeed very creative. They must reward you for this oooh, because this is the best movie I have seen so far. At least I am proud of Nigeria movie for once.” Another fan, Pokahunterz, wrote: “Any plans for it to be on Netflix later for us in the abroad that cannot watch. Heard wonderful reviews about the entire movie. From cast to costumes and everything in between. Well done@omonioboli.” Also, Yuggious wrote: “Ma, I saw your movie “Love is War” at the Genesis cinema in Umuahia, Abia state yesterday. That movie is so trilling. The suspense, the scenes, the attire. Everything about the movie is dope. So energetic! You did a well done job there, ma. I learned a lot about family from it too. Thank you for the movie, mama.”
