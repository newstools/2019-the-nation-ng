The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal in Sokoto State on Wednesday in Abuja affirmed the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal. The three-man tribunal dismissed the petition of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its governorship candidate, Ahmed Aliyu, for lacking in merit. Delivering judgment, tribunal Chairman Justice Abbas Bawale said the petitioners had failed to establish their claims to non- compliance with the Electoral Act and the issue of over voting. He said the evidence of the petitionersâ€™ witnesses, especially witness number 10, amounted to hearsay which could not prove any of the allegations. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Aliyu had gone to the tribunal seeking to upturn the victory of Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 governorship election. he poll, held on March 9, was declared inconclusive following cancellation of 75, 403 votes, which were higher than the 3, 413 votes margin between the leading candidates. A rerun was conducted on March 23, which led to the victory of Tambuwal, who won with a slim margin of 342 votes. Dissatisfied with the outcome, Aliyu approached the tribunal challenging the return of Tambuwal as the governor-elect, on the grounds that the election was marred by irregularities. Tambuwal and PDP had objected to the petition, which the tribunal unanimously dismissed, saying it disclosed substantial cause of action and was properly signed by the petitioners. In addition, the tribunal ruled that the petitioners duly paid the filling fees. It further held that the non-joinder of the running mate to the petitioners is not enough to render the petition incompetent. The Justice Bawale-led tribunal held that the application lacked merit and constituted a waste of judicial time.
