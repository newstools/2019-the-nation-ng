A SINGLE mother, Omowunmi Adekanbi urgently needs N1m for tests and a breast surgery. Adekanbi, who was at The Nation head office, Lagos during the week, has done three surgeries to remove several lumps from her left breast but after the last surgery in September last year, the lump reappeared. Speaking to this reporter, Adekanbi, who is in severe pain, said: “I have a problem on my left breast. I have removed the lump that keeps growing on it three times but it has grown again and the doctor said I have to remove it before it becomes cancerous. In the last years that I have been removing it, I have spent all of my savings.” Adekanbi who had also suffered from thyroid and operated it in the past says that she needs to remove it urgently and find a lasting solution to it. Showing this reporter past receipts, laboratory tests and prescriptions from doctors, she called on well-meaning Nigerians to come to her aid.
