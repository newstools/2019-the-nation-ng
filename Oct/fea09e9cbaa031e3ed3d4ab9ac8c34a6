Top Nigerian artistes  have thrilled fans at the Aspire Music Festival  held recently in Lagos. The music festival organised by Zenith Bank Plc at Harbour Point Event Center,  Lagos is part of the activities for the second edition of the bank’s lifestyle event, ‘Style by Zenith’. Among artistes that featured were:Olamide, Phyno, Flavour, Niniola, Rema and Mayorkun. Each  artiste came on stage with their A-game. Also on stage for rib-cracking jokes were music comedian Kenny Blaq, while celebrity hypeman and OAP, Do2dtun revved-up the crowd throughout the night event, giving them real value for their time. Kenny performed his signature comedy music skits. A notable skit from Kenny left many in awe when he performed his version of the late pop legend Michael Jackson’s smashing hit ‘Billie Jean’ featuring Zlatan. Another favourite of the crowd was when he sampled how an industrious gospel ‘Alaba’ musician can remix the popular ‘Zanku’ track to fit into his own genre. That performance elicited laughter from the crowd. Zenith Bank’s Aspire Music Festival is an annual lifestyle fair, one out of a series of events lined up to usher in ‘Style by Zenith 2.0’.
