1. Make visuals part of your social media strategy Great visuals are only as good as the social strategy that supports them. Your creative may follow best practices Every visual strategy should include: • Audience research. Do some background on your audience’s interests and think about what type of visual content they’d like to see.
• Create a mood board. Add content, colour palettes, and other visuals that will help shape your direction.
• Themes. Mix things up with recurring themes or pillars. Air France’s Instagram feed, for example, includes a combination of destination shots and airplane photos.
• Platform. Consider how you should adapt your visual strategy for each social channel.
• Timing. Make sure to post visuals on social at peak times. But think big picture, too. Will you need more visual content around certain holidays? Planning ahead will help you better manage your budget and production calendar 2. Get to know the creative basics There’s not one good way to create a visual. But there are some basic best practices to take into consideration. And you have to know the rules before you can break them. Here are some basic best practices for creating social media visuals: • Have a clear subject. It’s usually best to have a single focal point in your image.
• Remembers the rule of thirds. With some exceptions, it’s best not to centre your subject perfectly.
• Use natural light. If your image is too dark, it’s harder to see. But don’t overexpose your images, either.
• Make sure there’s enough contrast. Contrast provides balance, is easier to read, works better in black and white environments, and is more accessible.
• Choose complementary colors. Get familiar with a color wheel.
• Keep it simple. Make sure your visual is easy to understand.
• Don’t over-edit. Resist the temptation to press all the buttons. Subtly is a good policy when it comes to filters and features. Increase saturation with caution. 3. Size images to spec
One of the biggest crimes you can commit when sharing visuals on social media is using the wrong size.
Images with the wrong aspect ratio or low resolutions can be stretched, cropped, and crunched out of proportion all of which reflects poorly on your brand. Every platform has its own specifications and you should tailor your content accordingly. We’ve assembled a social media image size guide to help you. Always aim for the highest image quality. That includes pixels and resolution. And don’t ignore aspect ratio. Why? Some platforms auto-crop image previews based on aspect ratio. So if yours is different, you could end up with an unfortunate crop, or have important info left out. Or, you could pull a boss move like this. A few social media image sizing hacks: • Want to share a horizontal photo in a Story? Create a background or use a template so it doesn’t look small and sad.
• Stories and other vertical content display differently depending on the device being used.
• Don’t put anything important in the upper and lower 250-310 pixels.
• Preview how Instagram will crop a vertical photo on your grid by looking at the filter thumbnails before you publish.
• Check your analytics to see what devices your audience uses. If there’s a trend, size accordingly.
• Not enough room for your content? Animate it. 4. Be tasteful with text Whether you plan to create quote images, stylized typography, or use text overlays, less is always more when it comes to word count. Text in visuals should always be bold, legible, straightforward, and concise. Make sure there’s enough contrast between the text and background so that it’s readable.
What’s the best image-to-text ratio? It depends, and there are exceptions. In general, Facebook finds that images with less than 20% text tend to perform better. If you plan to use text as an overlay, make sure the visual leaves room for it. Or use a solid background.
The text should always improve not obscure your creative. Be sure it adds value to your message, too. If it’s only stating the obvious or describing the visual, you don’t need it. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when including text in images:
• Triple check spelling and grammar.
• Choose type wisely. Font can affect both tone and legibility.
• If you need to mix fonts, pair a serif with a sans serif.
• Avoid green and red or blue and yellow colour combos. According to WCAG, they’re more difficult to read.
• Keep line length short.
• Look out for orphan words. Leaving one word on the last line can look odd.
• Animate text to make it stand out. 5. Add your logo, where appropriate If you plan your visuals to be shared, it may be a good idea to include a logo.
Good branding is noticeable but not obtrusive. Typically that means putting a small logo in a corner or the outer frame of the visual. Not every Instagram post may need a logo, for example. If your Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook avatar is your logo, you may not need one in your cover banner, either. 6. Include alt-text descriptions When producing creative for social media, make it accessible for as many people and contexts as possible. Accessible content allows you to reach a broad audience and possibly edge out non-inclusive competitors in the process.
Accessible visual content on social media can include: • Alt-text descriptions. Alt-text allows the visually impaired to appreciate images. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram now provides fields for alt-text image descriptions. Here are some tips for writing descriptive alt-text. 7. Be creative
Creative work is always rewarded by customers with likes, comments, shares, and sales. And it has to power to earn new followers, too.
