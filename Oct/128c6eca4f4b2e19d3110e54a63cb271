ABOUT five commercial motorcycle  riders  popular known as Okada  were  attacked  and wounded   by suspected  thugs  belonging to a political  party in Gboko  town, Benue State at the weekend. For more than a month, members of the Benue Motorcycle Association (BEMOA) Gboko branch have been at loggerheads with some hoodlums in Gboko who took over their office and activities. Gboko town is the traditional headquarters of the Tiv people where the palace of Tor Tiv is located. Things took a frightening dimension on Saturday as thugs armed with cutlasses and clubs moved from one street to another, attacking okada riders. Many of the cyclists were injured and five have been admitted in  hospitals with various degrees of injuries. One of the injuries was so severe that he was rushed to Benue State Teaching Hospital Makurdi. President of BEMOA Comrade Agera Achin who confirmed the attack on his members, told The Nation on the phone that they have reported the incident to the state police command in Makurdi and the traditional ruler of Gboko Local Government Council. Comrade Achin said those injured have been admitted in hospital, and called on security agencies to protect his members. He said the lives of his members are under threat in Gboko because some hoodlums woke up one day and took over the affairs of Benue Motorcycle Association (BEMOA) in Gboko. A source at Gboko Police Area Command told The Nation that investigation into the incident has commenced.
