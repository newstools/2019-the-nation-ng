 It was a sit and watch setting for Super Eagles defender Leon Balogun as Brighton and Hove Albion beat visiting Spurs 3-0 on Saturday. The Nigeria international has not seen action in five straight Brighton matches including the 3-1 loss to Aston Villa in the league cup. The former Werder Bremen ace who joined Brighton just before the last World cup in Russia has only managed eight appearances for the side and was an unused substitute on Saturday as teammate and French import Neal Maupay opened scoring for Brighton in the 3rd minute of the match while Aaron Cornolly scored brace to shoot the tie beyond Spurs. Balogun who was part of the Super Eagles squad to both the last world cup and the last Nations cup in Egypt played combined seven matches in both competitions in which the Eagles crashed out in the group stage and finished in the third place respectively. He has however been left out of the Eagles squad for this month’s friendly against Brazil in Singapore.  His exclusion may not be unconnected with his lack of playing time in his club. The 31 year old appears to be suffering the same fate with compatriot and Leicester City forward Kelechi Iheanacho who has continued to be on the sidelines, managing in a few cases to have single digit playing time at the King Power Stadium. Interestingly the last time Brighton scored more than goal in a league match dates back to December 2018 against Crystal Palace.
