THE All Progressives Congress(APC) has rejected the tribunal ruling delivered against its Sokoto State Governorship candidate in the March 2019 General elections, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto. The party said it will end to the Appeal Court to further pursue justice, stating ” we believe that the judgment has turned justice on its head.” The Tribunal, which sat in Abuja, at its verdict, validated Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal’s reelection after dismissing the petition filed by APC’s guber candidate, Aliyu Sokoto challenging the victory of Tambuwal declared by INEC. In a statement on Thursday morning by APC Sokoto Chairman, Alhaji Sadiq Isah Achida, the party said: “In view of the unfair and unjustifiable ruling delivered by the Sokoto state Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, on Wednesday 2nd October, 2019 the party wishes to state categorically that it rejects the ruling. ” Our lawyers are studying details of the judgment , with a view to filing an appeal at the appropriate court of law.” “Meanwhile, the APC wishes to call on its teeming members across the state to remain calm and peaceful , while the party explored all available legal means to reclaim its stolen mandate. “We wish to thank all our members and electorates in the state for their continued support and loyalty . We remain committed to defending your interest at all times.”
