 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the allegation of collusion with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), as an intimidation ploy. Deputy National Publicity Secretary Mr. Yekini Nabena, who dismissed the PDP’s alarm as a baseless foul crying, alleged that the PDP and its candidate were doing everything possible to intimidate the Resident Electoral Commission (REC) into doing their bidding. The PDP’s governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, on Monday alleged that the APC had connived with the INEC to influence the list of Supervisory Presiding Officers (SPOs) deployed in Bayelsa State for the election. But in a statement made available to reporters on Tuesday in Abuja, Nabena said the PDP and its governorship candidate were crying wolf in the face of imminent defeat on November 16. APC alleged that the Bayelsa REC and other officials rejected the bribe given to them by the PDP elements, hence the call for the REC’s removal. “The baseless allegation by the PDP and their governorship candidate is part of their plan to intimidate INEC and other critical stakeholders that will be on official election duty. You can see the PDP during their campaigns; they have nothing to tell Bayelsans following the failed administration of Governor Seriake Dickson. So they have resorted to falsehood, peddling rumours and crying wolf. “The popularity and wide acceptance of the APC governorship candidate, Chief David Lyon, is giving the PDP sleepless nights. PDP’s nightmares will soon be over after Bayelsans vote them out on November 16,” Nabena said. He said the real issue is the PDP’s plot to turn Bayelsa State into a war zone so as to enable them buy votes and rig the election. “Bayelsans are more alarmed by the PDP’s arms stockpiling, massive looting of state funds by the outgoing government of Seriake Dickson and other illegal activities geared to rig the election,” Nabena said.
