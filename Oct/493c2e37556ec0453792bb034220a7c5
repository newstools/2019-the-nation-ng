Damisi Ojo, Akure  More facts emerged on Monday on why governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State sacked his Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Political Matters, Mr Augustine Pelemo attached to the office of the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi The removal of Pelemo was contained in a statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo. The Commissioner said the sack is with immediate effect; saying,” it underscores the need to instil sanity and nip in the bud, divisive acts and tendencies inimical to the existing cordiality and cohesion in the administration led by the governor”. However, sources hinted that the governor allegedly sacked Pelemo far calling the wife of the deputy governor, Mrs Ajewola Agboola Ajayi, an acting first Lady on his Facebook page while wishing her happy birthday. Akeredolu and his wife, while travelling out of the country, handed power to the deputy governor to take charge of the affairs of the state through a letter he transmitted to the State House of Assembly. This might not be unconnected with the reason Pelemo addressed the wife of the deputy governor as acting First Lady while rejoicing with her on her birthday. Commenting on the development, Ajayi through his spokesman,Babatope Okeowo said” the deputy governor is aware of the sack of the Special Assistant to the Governor on Political Matter attached to his office. He said” Governor Akeredolu who has the power to hire all his aides including his Deputy, he also has the power to sack them. That of Pelemo is not an exception” The Deputy Governor wished Pelemo well in his future political and other endeavours.
