Maruti Suzuki, which enjoys almost half of car market share in India, on Friday posted a decline in consolidated net profits by nearly 39 per cent during the past three months. This is adjudged to be the steepest quarterly fall in the company’s net profits in the past eight years, even as it could sell nearly 338,000 vehicles during the quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2018. According to the data released by the company, Maruti’s consolidated net profits during the quarter stood at 1,391 crores Indian Rupees (or about $200 million). The main reasons attributed by company sources which led to the decline in profits include – fall in domestic demand due to overall economic slowdown and higher sales promotion expenses to boost sales. Net sales during the quarter declined by 25 per cent to 16,123 crores Indian Rupees (or 2.3 billion U.S. dollars), compared to 21,553 crores Indian Rupees (or 3 billion U.S. dollars) during July to Sept. 2018. The company’s Chairman, India Bhargava, said the current year had been witnessing a significant decline in vehicles sales, one of main reasons leading to increase in cost of cars with new safety regulations. This was coupled with an increase in insurance cost and the hike in road taxes in many states. Bhargava said further that the lower availability of finance and the increased down payment requirements at the time of buying a new car had further affected the affordability of the prospective customers. He, however, added that the  festive season had witnessed a marginal rise in sales.
