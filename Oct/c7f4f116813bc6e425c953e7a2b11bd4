Two students of a tertiary institution based in Ondo State on Tuesday made attempts to commit suicide after failing the preliminary examination of their institution. The students reportedly decided to kill themselves when they discovered that they had failed the final preliminary examination, which would enable them to go to 100 level. The two students, who are currently receiving medical treatment at a private hospital in Akure, the state capital, allegedly consumed Snipper insecticide. A source at the hospital said the two students were brought by their neighbours, but declined to disclose their identities, claiming that divulging such information was against the ethics of the medical profession. He disclosed that the victims attempted to commit suicide for failing their examinations at the preliminary level. He, however, said that the two students were already responding to treatment. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the State Police Command, Femi Joseph, could not be reached for reactions.
