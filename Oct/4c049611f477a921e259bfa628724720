Now 1000 Dirhams (UAE’s Currency) is N100,000 and a bundle of 100,000 Dirhams is N10 million.

Using of charms is haram Going to native doctors is a fatal sin No matter how you try to modernise it , jaruma is a digital dibia. — IgboMade (@volqx) October 5, 2019  Whn I said Titans have mental health issues, it sounded like beef. Y'all thought you were cool, but you fell for clouts. Jaruma used you. Peter psquare & even Tasha's management used you. Now y'all are mute & taking Ls for your stans.
