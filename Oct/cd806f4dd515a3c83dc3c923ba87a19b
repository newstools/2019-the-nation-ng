 AMID opposition, President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday sent the list of his nominees for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) governing board to the Senate for approval. Some stakeholders in the region are said to have reservations about the nominations. They are unhappy with the appointment of Bernard Okumagba as Managing Director and former Edo State Deputy Governor Pius Odubu as board chairman. Some indigenes of Ondo State reportedly claimed that their state was sidelined for Edo. They accused Buhari of jettisoning the age-long formula for selecting NDDC board chairman, which would have favoured it. Senate President Ahmad Lawan read Buhariâ€™s letter during a plenary session. The nominees are Dr Odubu (Edo), Okumagba (Delta), Executive Director (Projects) Otobong Ndem (Akwa Ibom), Executive Director (Finance and Administration) Maxwell Okoh (Bayelsa), Prophet Jones Erue (Delta State representative), Chief Victor Ekhatar (Edo), Dr. Joy Yimebe Nunieh (Rivers) and Nwogu Nwogu (Abia). Others are Theodore A. Allison (Bayelsa), Victor Antai (Akwa Ibom), Maurice Effiwatt (Cross River), Olugbenga Elema (Ondo), Uchegbu Kyrian (Imo), Aisha Murtala Muhammed (Kano, Northwest Representative), Ardo Zubairu (Adamawa, Northeast Representative) and Badmus Mutalib (Lagos, Southwest Representative).
