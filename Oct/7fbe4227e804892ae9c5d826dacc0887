 Hosts of 2018 World cup Russia, are still reaping the gains of the event which was held between June 14 and July 15 2018 in eleven Russian cities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Tuesday that alcohol consumption in the country has dropped to all time low of 43%. The Organisation opined that the achievement was made under sport-loving president Vladimir Putin who has continued to approve moves at restrictions on alcohols sales and consumption and promotion while promoting healthy lifestyles. Recall that the authorities announced restrictions of alcohol sale and bans in some areas during the World cup in apparently to prevent a repeat of 2016 incident where fans clashed after Euro 2016 match between England and Russia. Moscow official Kirill Malyshkin had said during the World Cup “Executive power bodies have set the borders where the sale and consumption of alcohol will be banned, on the eve of a football World Cup match and the day it is held.” ‘The Russian Federation has long been considered one of the heaviest-drinking countries in the world,’ the report said, adding that alcohol was a major contributor to a spike in deaths in the 1990s. The report further linked the achievement to in increased life expectancies, which reached a historic peak in 2018, at 78 years for women and 68 years for men. Host Russia began their opening match of the 2018 World cup with a 5-0 demolition of Saudi Arabia and went all the way to the Quarter finals where they lost to eventual finalists Croatia on 3-4 on penalties after the match ended 2-2 after extra time.
