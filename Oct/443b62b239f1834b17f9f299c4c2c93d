A LECTURER at the Kogi State University (KSU), Ayingba, Dr. Usman Ogbo, was attacked in Ankpa at the weekend during a ‘thank you’ tour embarked on by People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) governorship candidate Musa Wada. The opposition PDP last Friday inaugurated its campaign committees in Lokoja ahead of the November 16 governorship poll. The Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Mohammed (APC- Ankpa 1), was said to have been in town, and his convoy had cause to pass through the venue of PDP eent, which might have caused the skirmish. The convoy of the PDP governorship candidate alongside his supporters reportedly clashed with those of the ruling All Progressives Congress while the former was in Ankpa, on a thank you visit. It was gathered that the clash might have erupted when some APC chieftains reportedly drove their vehicles into the convoy of the PDP candidate. Police Commissioner   Hakeem Busari, while confirming the incident, said  one person was injured.a
