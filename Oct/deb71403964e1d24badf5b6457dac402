All too soon, six years have rolled by after the death of the renowned undertaker, the late Tunji Okusanya, and son Tunji Jnr., in an ill-fated crash. But Bolanle Okusanya, the first daughter of the late undertaker, is still keeping the flag flying. A popular make-up artist and the first daughter of the late MIC Royal Limited boss, Bolanle has not only continued to celebrate her late father and late son, but has also taken charge of the business with grace. After the death of her father, Bolanle has  proved that contrary to the popular impression, a well-nurtured female child can also make the parents proud as she has since assumed the leadership of MIC Royal Limited, her late father’s business.
