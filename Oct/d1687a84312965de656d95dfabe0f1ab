Nigeria born British boxer Anthony Joshua has been told to take a break from boxing should he fail to win in the December 7 rematch against Andy Ruiz Jnr. The Mexican himself sarcastically gave the advice while boasting about readiness for the showdown billed for Saudi Arabia. Joshua’s defeat was a huge surprise to many with the 29year old 2012 Olympic Gold Medalist admitting he had to ‘grieve’ after that shock loss in June at Madison Square Garden. The pair are scheduled to have a huge rematch in December after Ruiz Jnr took Joshua’s three world heavyweight title belts in their initial fight in New York. Ruiz Jnr believes he can defeat Joshua once again when they come to blows in Saudi Arabia and has advised the British to step away from the ring if he fails to regain his world titles. ‘I think he should take a little break if I beat him,’ Ruiz Jr told Sky Sports. ‘Let him recuperate, but one or two losses are not going to make a difference. ‘He’s still a warrior, he’s still a great fighter, and I’m sure he’ll bounce back,” he submitted Joshua nonetheless remains optimistic that he can reclaim his titles in the all-important rematch that has kept the boxing world waiting Recall that Joshua dropped Ruiz Jr. in the third round, for the first time in the challenger’s career. Ruiz Jr. beat the count, and scored his own knock down moments later. Joshua was down again towards the end of the round in a massive turn around. At the time of stoppage Ruiz Jr. was leading the fight 57–56 on two scorecards and Joshua was leading 57–56 on the other. It is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in the history of boxing.
