Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa  The Bayelsa State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has said the state government was waiting for the directive of the Federal Government to decide on the payment of the minimum wage. The state chairman, NLC, John Bipre Ndiomu, said any state claiming to pay minimum wage without a federal template was deceiving itself. He said: “We are still waiting for the Federal Government to finalize. How can the states pay when they don’t know how much to pay. Apart from level 1 to 6 that is clear, nobody knows how much to pay”.
