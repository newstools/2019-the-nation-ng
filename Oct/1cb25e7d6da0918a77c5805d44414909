Malual Ayom Dor, the former deputy military chief for administration, said that his residence at Hai Nyakuron West in Juba was attacked by unknown gunmen on Sunday evening.
Speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Monday, Lieutenant General Malual Ayom said his security guard, Garang Deng, who was posted outside the residence was killed when unknown assailants opened fire outside the house, adding the attackers also took phones from his nephew. “The incident occurred when the security guard and my nephew Ayom Lueth were returning home from my late brother’s house where they normally have dinner,” he said. “When the two people were coming home, two armed men in plain clothes emerged from the gate and asked my nephew who was ahead to kneel down, so after they asked my nephew to surrender his wallet and phones, they shot Garang when he appeared,” he added. The security guard was rushed to Juba Military Hospital after being shot but died on Monday while being treated, he said. The South Sudanese army general pointed out that he was not present when the incident took place. “I left Juba for Nairobi on Sunday, but I will go back to Juba to attend the funeral,” he said. Malual pointed out that the motive of the attack that left his security guard dead remains unclear.
