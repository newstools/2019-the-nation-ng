The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto State has rejected the tribunal’s ruling delivered against its governorship candidate, Chairman Sadiq Achida has said. He said the party would head for the Appeal Court. Achida said: “We believe the judgment has turned justice on its head.” The tribunal, which sat in Abuja on Wednesday, validated Governor Aminu Tambuwal’s re-election after dismissing the petition by the APC governorship candidate, Ahmed Aliyu, challenging the victory of Tambuwal, who was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In a statement yesterday by Achida, APC said: “In view of the unfair and unjustifiable ruling delivered by the Sokoto State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, we wish to state that we reject the ruling. “Our lawyers are studying the judgment with a view to filing an appeal at the appropriate court of law. “We implore our members across the state to remain calm and peaceful. We will explore all legal means to reclaim our stolen mandate. “We thank our members and the electorate for their support and loyalty. We remain committed to defending your interests at all times.” Governor Tambuwal has dedicated his victory to God and the people. The governor, who addressed the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) supporters that converged on the Sokoto State Government House after the judgment, said: “There is no doubt that power belongs to God. It is His will that I emerged victorious at the inconclusive general election and now at the tribunal.” He acknowledged the support and prayers for him by the people since the beginning of the struggle. Tambuwal thanked the tribunal for its fairness in handling the petitions and urged his opponents to support his administration in order to work for the development of the state. Former Governor Attahiru Bafarawa appealed to supporters of all the parties to rally support for the Tambuwal administration.
