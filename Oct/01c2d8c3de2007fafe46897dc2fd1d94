A breakdown of the figures is contained in the Short and Medium Term Blueprint/Work Plan on the implementation of Education for Change: A Ministerial Strategic Plan (MSP) document obtained by The Nation in Abuja. The document estimated that the number of out-of-school children at the end of five years (2018-2023) would be 193, 918. To achieve this (193,918), the government said it has launched intervention programmes aimed at reducing the rate of out-of-school children in Nigeria by 2, 000, 000 every year for the next five years. The document said: “The 2018 National Personnel Audit for primary schools in Nigeria shows that 10, 193, 918 were out of school. “Following the various Federal Government intervention programmes aimed at reducing the rate of out-of-school children in Nigeria by 2, 000, 000 every year for the next five years, the estimated out-of-school children at the end of the five years will be 193, 918. “The above followed the assumption that there would be no new out-of-school children in these five years. “All children of school age will automatically enrol in school, following the compulsory years of schooling as enshrined in the Universal Basic Education Act.”
