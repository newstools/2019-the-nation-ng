Bishop of the Diocese of Lagos and Missioner, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rt. Rev. Humphrey Olumakaiye, has called on those occupying various positions of leadership in the country to eschew materialism, spirit of selfishness and move closer to God so that Nigeria can be the dream of every Nigerian and comfortably occupy its rightful position in the comity of nations. Olumakaiye gave this charge on Saturday during the prayer walk on the centenary city of the Diocese of Lagos, which is the permanent site for convention ground with a view to taking possession of the convention centre. He also congratulated Nigerians on the 59th anniversary of the country’s independence but however said, “We can agree that the country cannot be said to be stagnant since it got independence 59 years ago, though the level of progress could be considered to be slow.” ishop of the Diocese of Lagos and Missioner, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rt.
