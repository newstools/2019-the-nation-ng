 THE Federal Government has advised youths to leverage their creativity and potential to the nation’s automotive industrial creation. The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami made this call during the launch of automotive design challenge with focus on mini-taxi and mini-tractors in Abuja, with the theme, ‘Give your ideas wheels’ . He said if the youth participated in the sector, this would ensure that the $8billion spent annually in the sector by Nigerians will be domiciled  in the country. Malami said: “Young Nigerians are very creative; they should use this opportunity to showcase their creativity in the automotive design concept. This is a highly commendable effort that would go a long way in the promotion of innovation and solution applicable for the nation challenge in mechanical, agricultural and public transportation. “The government will provide all the necessary support to aid their contribution to the automotive sector, as youth’s effort would translate into greater savings of foreign exchange and also boost the nation’s economy.
