THE abducted 84-year-old monarch of Tarakiri clan, Southern Ijaw, Bayelsa State, King George Agbabou Week, has regained freedom 25 days after he was kidnapped by unknown gunmen. Unidentified gunmen on October 3 abducted the Traditional Ruler, who is the father of the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Doodei Week, and whisked him away from his country home at Ayama-Ijaw to unknown place. The Ebenanaowei of Tarakiri Clan was reportedly kidnapped about 11:20pm by seven masked men, who carried weapons including AK47 rifles. The assailants ransacked the palace of the king carting away television sets, jewelry and other valuables. They reportedly mishandled the victim as they dragged him on the ground to the waterside, where they fled with him on speedboats. But the commissioner, Doodei Week, confirmed that his father was freed by the kidnappers on Sunday. Week said:  “Finally, my role model, man who thought me things, including courage, fear of God, love, perseverance, respect, humility, how to say no or yes, where it is the right time to say, and above all, prays for me,  is back home after 25days of incarceration by adversarial elements”, he said. It was learnt that the king regained freedom following weeks of negotiations that resulted in payment of undisclosed ransom. When contacted the Police Public Relations Officer, Asimin Butswat, confirmed the freedom of the monarch.
