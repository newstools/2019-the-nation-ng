To empower physically challenged persons and keen on integrating them into the authority’s vision of a cleaner and livable environment, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has employed 20 challenged as sweepers of pedestrian bridges across the state. LAWMA Managing Director Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin,  said the authority had stepped up its drive to rid the state of waste and it had become necessary to engage stakeholders, including physically challenged persons. “The cleanliness of the Lagos State is a collective responsibility. We need all hands to be on deck to help us realise our vision of building a cleaner city we all will be proud of. That is why we have decided to engage these special sweepers to play their own part in achieving this,” he said. Gbadegesin said LAWMA had engaged the disabled sweepers, instead of leaving them to beg on the streets, adding that they would be assigned to clean various pedestrian bridges in the state, such as  Ojota New Bridge, Alausa Secretariat Bridge, Ikeja Along Bridge and CMS Bridge. He said: “We have mapped out pedestrian bridges where they will be operating, such as Ojota New Bridge, Alausa Secretariat Bridge, Ikeja Along Bridge, CMS Bridge, Palm Groove bridge, Oshodi Oke bridge, and Anthony Bus Stop.’’
