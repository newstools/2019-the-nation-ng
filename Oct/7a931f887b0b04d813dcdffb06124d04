Our Reporter One hundred and thirty-two repentant Boko Haram members were on Sunday reintegrated into their communities by the Borno State Government. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Zuwaira Gambo, disclosed this at a handing over ceremony of some rehabilitated Boko Haram members in Maiduguri. She said the youth were released to their families and local government officials after completing 12-month skills acquisition and rehabilitation training at the Bulumkutu Rehabilitation Transit Centre. Gambo said the training was designed to equip the beneficiaries with skills that would enable them generate income, be self-reliant and add value to their society. She said that sewing machines, barbing kits, shoe making kits and money were given to the beneficiaries as resettlement package. Bashir Ahmed, one of the beneficiaries, thanked the government for the empowerment programme, describing it as a life changer. “We are grateful to the Borno State Government and other organisations such as International Organisation for Migration and other humanitarian agencies. “We remain grateful for the reintegration and rehabilitation programme aimed at supporting ex-insurgents to become meaningful citizens,” he said.
