 Former Super Eagles defender Efe Ambrose has declared that he would have been very surprised to hear Fikayo Tomori turned down England for Nigeria The former Celtic ace recalled that while at Derby County, Tomori never for once mentioned or discussed anything concerning his origin, noting that he was very British all the way. He also recalled that the 21 year old was very popular while they were at Derby County. “Tomori was very popular at Derby. He was later voted the player of the season but not once did he talk about his Nigerian roots. In fact, it was a journalist friend of mine that told him he has Nigerian roots. It’s very unusual because most Nigerian players born abroad usually like to associate with fellow Nigerians particularly if you have played for the national team as I did for years” he added Efe Ambrose, who made 51 appearances for Super Eagles scoring four goals, was reacting to England’s call up for Tomori ahead of the Three Lions double header against Czech Republic and Bulgaria later this month. ”I am not surprised; in fact, I would have if he decided to represent Nigeria. He feels very British which is understandable considering the fact that he was born and raised there,”Efe who has since become a free agent after failing to secure extension of short term contract he signed with Derby Count told Owngoalnigeria The 4-time Scottish Premier League winner who started his career with Kaduna United in 2006 played for Israeli side Ashdod as well as two Scottish premier league sides Celtic and Hibernian.  He won the Nations Cup under late Super Eagles coach Stephen keshi in 2013.
