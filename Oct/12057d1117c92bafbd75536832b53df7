  THE Rotary Club of Falomo has offered free eyeglasses to indigent residents of Okobaba community in the Ebute Metta area of Lagos State. Its President, Julie Nkanga, said this corrective glasses were presented to 57 persons after 300 of them were screened. The club had identified over 100 residents  that would undergo free cataract surgery. She stressed that the presentation of free glasses was the outcome of the test earlier conducted for patients in the area. Nkanga said the cataract surgery on the 101 patients will be done sometime in November with the collaboration of the Rotary Club of Lagos Palmgroove. “Two weeks ago, we ran the test for 300 people, out of which 57 are due for glasses, while 101 will go for the cataract eye surgery in November. These presentations of free eyeglasses are for those that ran the test and were recommended for glasses. “So, in conjunction with Rotary Club of Lagos Palm groove, we put together this free cataract surgery, while on our own in Falomo, we are the ones solely responsible for the provision of the glasses based on the test. “Rotary is all about service to humanity, so, one of our core projects for this Rotary year is tagged the cataract eye test project. So, this is to fulfil part of our responsibilities for the year. We would also foot the bill of the cataract surgeries for them,” Nkanga said. Immediate past President of the club, Ndubuisi Okaro, said, “Okobaba is one of our focus communities because we once funded the beggars colony school located here in Okobaba and we ran it for about seven years.”
