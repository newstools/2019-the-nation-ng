 LIST of the 21 players that will represent Nigeria at the 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations in Egypt will be made public today, according to an informed source to the team. Defending Champions Nigeria  beat Libya and Sudan to qualify for the third edition to be hosted in the city of Cairo between November 8 and 22. The Confederation of African Football has alerted that all the eight teams that are taking part in the competition which serves as the qualifiers for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo to submit the names of their 21 players before the end of today. Camp sources informed that Imama Amapakabo and his technical crew are putting finishing touches to ensure that the list of players is made available today so that the Nigeria Football Federation does not pay needless fine for late submission. Amapakabo is having a torrid time ensuring that he has the full complement of his foreign based stars but it was gathered that a host of them have assured him that they will link up with the team in Egypt. The U-23 team has  been training in Abuja since last week played a goalless draw against Niger Tornadoes yesterday at the FIFA Goal Project, Abuja and will  today trade tackles with Nasarawa United at the same venue. Meanwhile, the U-23 team will depart  Abuja for Cairo on Thursday  with some foreign pros expected to link up with their teammates in the North African nation for the final phase of preparations.
