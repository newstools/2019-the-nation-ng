PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari on Monday said that his administration will increase funding for the judiciary to enable it to discharge its responsibilities. A statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the President  spoke at the commissioning of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) headquarters annex in Abuja. A valedictory session was held for the court’s outgoing President, Justice Babatunde Adejumo, on the occasion. The President said: “You will all recall that in 2014, the entire budgetary allocation to the judiciary was N68 billion. “Today, the judiciary budgetary allocation has gone up to N100 billion. Rest assured that we shall continue to adequately fund the judiciary to ensure it is enabled to discharge its responsibilities.” President Buhari stressed that it is the collective duty of the three arms of government to ensure that rights are safeguarded. “Simply put, all Nigerians, regardless of ethnicity, religion and politics deserve peaceful and prosperous lives. “Where these basic rights are trampled upon, Nigerians deserve fair justice delivery. “It is, therefore, our collective duty to work collaboratively to ensure that such rights are safeguarded,” he said. The President congratulated Justice Adejumo on his retirement and meritorious service, adding that his contributions were appreciated. “I am confident his legacy will have a positive impact on those who follow him,” he said. President Buhari noted that the court is constitutionally mandated to resolve labour disputes, emphasising that its performance directly impacts Nigeria’s ease of doing business indices. “The socio-economic impact of this court cannot be downplayed as it also provides the platform for employees, retirees as well as the dependents of deceased employees to find justice when treated unfairly,” he added.
