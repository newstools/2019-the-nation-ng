THE Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), announced on Friday it has seized no fewer than 1,072 vehicles from suspected smugglers since the closure of Nigerian borders with neighbouring countries. The Public Relations’ Officer of the organization, Mr. Joseph Attah said in Katsina that the vehicles were seized while trying to cross into the country through illegal routes. Attah spoke during a sensitization programme on the Border Drill Operation. He said that over 19,000 bags of foreign rice, 4,765 Jerry cans of petrol, two fuel tankers and thousands of ammunition were similarly confiscated as were 131 bags of NPK fertilizer. He said the fertilizer would have been used to make explosive device. Three hundred and seventeen suspects and 146 illegal immigrants were arrested during the period. He pointed out that the closure had helped in ensuring security for the citizens as well as improved the nation’s economy. He said: “anytime you buy   foreign rice, you have empowered foreign farmers, while our farmers are suffering in spite of government interventions like Anchor Borrower, which is aimed at boosting rice production. “We are now like candle burning ourselves and lightening others.” He said the Border Drill Operation was designed to check the menace of smuggling and illegal immigrants into the country.
