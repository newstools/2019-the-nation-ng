Former Lagos State Commissioner for Transport and All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors’ Advisory Council (GAC) member Chief Lanre Razak spoke with reporters on the Sanwo-Olu administration, the challenges before President Muhammadu Buhari, the zoning controversy and other issues. EMMANUEL OLADESU was there How would you assess the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s performance, given the peculiar challenges of the Lagos State? A lot of Nigerians don’t know what it takes to run a government. You gave somebody an assignment, but without the right tools that will place that person in a position to effectively finish it. You can’t give a messenger an assignment and without the necessary tools and expect him to perform. Lagos State is a coastal state and our geographical location is such that the city is less than one meter above the sea level, which means that the state requires huge amount of money to keep the roads functional and in good condition all the year round. The governor was sworn in on May 29 and naturally has to take his time to study what he inherited from his predecessor and apply scientific method to effectively get all his plans actualised. He came at a time most of the roads were in deplorable condition and there is no way you can repair the roads during rainy season. Therefore, I want to appeal to Lagosians to kindly bear with the governor. After all, it is said that the patient dog eat the fattest bone. I can assure them that Governor Sanwo-Olu means well. He knows the job, he knows what to do and he will do it well. The state government is aware that most of the roads are bad across the state. These includes  Epe, the Lagos – Badagry the expressway being constructed to link Badagry and Seme border in Benin Republic has been abandoned for some years, which I consider as a national disgrace and motorists can’t even ply it. But, the good news is that the governor has mobilised the contractor back to site and looking into other abandoned projects such as the Agege-Pen Cinema overhead bridge,  Agege Pen Cinema overhead bridge, Agric-Isawo road; Bola Ahmed Tinubu -Igbogbo road, which government will attend to as soon as the rains stop. Lagosians will see Sanwo-Olu in action in all parts of the state soon, but we shouldn’t ask him to start awarding road contracts during rainy season as doing so means that you want him to throw taxpayers money in the drain and that is why we are appealing to our people to bear with the state government. They should also realise that the challenge is a natural phenomenon, which is outside the capability of the governor. He cannot stop the rains, he is not a rain maker. So, they should bear with him and be rest assured that he is going to deliver to satisfaction of all. What about refuse disposal across the state? A lot is being done by the Lagos Waste Management Authority, LAWMA in this regard. You should have noticed that the Private Sector Participation, PSP operators are back on the streets after the governor renewed their contract. They are up and doing right now and I believe that Lagosians should be satisfied with their performance in refuse collection and management. You must have noticed too that the highway managers are back and always busy cleaning the highways regularly. We no longer see refuse heaps across the state major highways as was the case before Governor Sanwo-Olu was sworn in as governor. The managers are working very hard to keep Lagos clean and they will improve tremendously once the rainy season is over. How come that most of Lagos roads are bad at the same time? Is this not an indictment on the government that the roads have not been maintained over time? You may say so, but that is not exactly the issue. The truth is that roads were constructed at various times and have a lifespan. If the foundation of some of these roads becomes weak then, they start failing, which is a serious challenge to the government. I want to assure the people that the incumbent administration is capable of addressing this challenge, it is fully aware of their pains but government requires a lot of money to fix the bad roads. That is why also, I have been appealing to Lagosians to pay their taxes and charges as at when due because the governor needs the revenue to get the job done. In the meantime, the governor has written the State House of Assembly to grant him approval to obtain N250billion loan to execute various development projects for the benefit of the people. I call on Lagos lawmakers to speedily consider and approve the governor’s loan request. We are aware that most of these roads would go bad because Lagos been a former federal capital has many federal roads that have not been attended to for years. But the state government doesn’t want to be crying like a baby over the deplorable state of roads, complaining that federal roads don’t belong to the state and that is why the governor has been very proactive in addressing this challenge. The truth is that Lagosians ply these roads daily and there shouldn’t be excuses by the government, which is why Sanwo-Olu is tackling the challenge. Is there any hope for local government roads now that the federal and state roads are bad? There is hope. We have 57 local governments and LCDAs in the state. I am aware that the attention of the leadership at the local government level had been drawn to the fact that the roads are bad and they are already providing palliatives on some of the roads in deplorable condition to ameliorate the plight of motorists in order to move around conveniently. Rainfall has been a challenge to the councils and I am sure that once the rain is over most of the bad roads will be fixed. We have noticed that the sanitation habit of some Lagosians hasn’t changed for good over the years. Some still dump refuse and other wastes on drainage channels, thereby causing serious flooding in some area… That is reason why some, people have been clamoring for the return of sanitary inspectors who should inspect every residence to ensure that Lagosians comply with sanitation laws. Moving forward our people must change dirty habits for good and I don’t care attitude to the environment in modern day Nigeria. As a people we should work more on preventive healthcare than curative healthcare. If we keep our surroundings very clean and hygienic, we will hardly fall sick and spend most of our money in the hospitals. It is very important that Lagosians should embrace good sanitation habits. They should not throw refuse and waste into drainages, thinking that the will be enough storm water to take them to the lagoon because if you do that you are indirectly polluting the lagoon where the fishes we eat are caught and this is not good for our health. I will appeal to the media too to help the government enlighten Lagosians and Nigerians on the need to keep our environment clean and not to pollute it in order not to jeopardize their health condition. What are the other challenges you think the governor should tackle in earnest, apart from bad roads? As you are aware, Governor Sanwo-Olu has a six-point developmental pillars as captured in the ‘THEMES’ agenda, which is: traffic management and transportation; health and environment; education and technology; making Lagos a 21st century economy and entertainment and tourism which are crucial to the needs of Lagosians. Among these, traffic management is very critical because if we waste a lot of man hours on the roads, it will impact negatively on the economy and this will adversely affect productivity and government will not be able to meet set revenue targets. Again, the governor is fully aware of this and his administration is currently working seriously on traffic management so that everybody can easily get to his or her destination on time. There are several factors hampering free flow of traffic in Lagos and they are both vehicular and human including the activities of commercial motor bikes popularly known as okada and tricycle operators. You must have observed that once there are bad roads and any time it is raining it adversely affect the flow of traffic. But I want to assure the people that the governor and his team are working assiduously to address the situation. They are working seriously on the water ways also for us to have a synchronized system of transportation comprising the roads, rail and water so that Lagosians can get to their various destinations as quickly as possible. The issue of health is also receiving the governor’s attention while education too is dear to his heart which is very commendable. Government is committed to providing quality education to our children. The administration is working seriously on the economy in order to provide an enabling environment for businesses to grow. I am confident that Lagosians will have every reason to smile very soon once the governor starts delivering on most of his campaign promises. Recently, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Babachir Lawal said the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, possesses the qualities to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Do you think the former Lagos governor is good enough for the APC presidential ticket in the years ahead? In this country, we know that the best person never gets to the position he aspires to deploy his wealth of experience in service to father land. But, I believe that, in Tinubu’s case, the story will different this time around. We loyalists of the Asiwaju have told him that, whether he likes it or not, he should run for the presidency of Nigeria in 2023. We have found in him all the attributes required of a 21st century leader and potential presidential candidate and we don’t want a situation whereby there will be lamentation that he was the best president that Nigeria never had. No, it will not happen; because we are confident that his will be a case of the best president we will have and that is why we are appealing to him to run when time comes. We are living witnesses to the many special gifts that God has given to him, which includes his ability to manage men and resources; ability to discover talents; provide the needed human capital; get things done quickly; uncommon gift of projecting into the future and tell what will happen politically. We are witnesses to what he did in Lagos state to provide the needed solid financial base and the right foundation for the state when he was governor from 1999 to 2007. Recall that his administration raised the state internally generated revenue, IGR from N600million to over N30billion monthly without inflicting additional pain on tax payers and that is one of the special attributes of a capable leader. That is also why we are appealing to him and encouraging him that God in His wonderful way will compensate him and allow him get the APC presidential ticket. Truth is that it is not easy to go out there and serve the people, it wears a person down but in this case we want Tinubu to leave Nigeria better than what we have now and we know he possesses the right qualities and the energy to get the job done. We believe that after Buhari, we will be lucky in 2023 to have the former governor of Lagos state as president for Nigeria to have a solid foundation for leadership development. Do you see the APC zoning the presidential ticket to Southern Nigeria? I am not too particular about zoning or not zoning the presidential ticket. What bothers me is for our great party to present the best candidate for the best job and Nigerians will see the reason in this particular person. I am sure they will agree with some of us who are really working and advocating for Tinubu’s emergence as president and by the grace of God he will get there. In other words, it is not about zoning, it is about getting the right leadership, a person who can provide the needs of Nigerians at the shortest time possible and utilising the nation’s available resources. We can no longer afford to continue to suffer in the midst of plenty on account of poor leadership. Nigeria is potentially very rich nation and is not acceptable to the people that we have this kind of a good leader and we can’t make use of him to get to where we are all clamoring to be. It is another level that Nigeria requires and Tinubu is the pilot that is taking us there this time around. What do you expect President Buhari to focus on between now and 2023 when his tenure will expire now? As a party, the APC has promised that we are taking Nigerians to the Next Level of socio-economic development. These include higher level on transportation, education, health, road infrastructure and other infrastructure, agriculture and food security. That is our focus as a party and that is what we expect President Buhari and his team to focus on so that we can deliver on the promises we made to Nigerians and meet the needs of the people. How receptive is Governor Sanwo-Olu to party men, party leaders and elders? There is a popular axiom that says: show me your friends and I will tell you who you are. The background of people will tell who they are. Sanwo-Olu is a gentleman to the core, one very well brought up, who has respect for elders and such person can never fall because he has made himself available for those who will advise and guide him aright and that is why we are happy we voted for him. He is a man you call any time and he will pick his phone and you tell him if you see anything wrong anywhere in the state. If you tell him the reactions of people on an issue, he will give the reason immediately. The governor and his deputy Dr. Obafemi Hamzat are fantastic people and a pair that Lagosians will be happy about given their governance style. So we are lucky to have this time around a listening governor and a very effective deputy. Do you support the reappointment of the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu when his tenure expires on November 11? Magu is my man any day, any time. It is a fact that you don’t disband a battalion of soldiers winning battles for you. After the best, what do you look for? When you have somebody who distinguishes himself performing his duties, won’t you reappoint him? Magu is still very effective and capable, irrespective of what his adversaries are saying. He is doing the job very well and Mr. President should allow him continue to sanitise the country. Imagine somebody allegedly stealing and building houses worth over N272billion and I ask: what is the person going to do with such money? If such money had been deployed by the Federal Government, the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Lagos- Abeokuta road would have been completed with such a huge amount of fund and that is what somebody is alleged to have stolen. I and many Nigerians believe that Magu is doing a great job and has a track record of service so why do you want to replace him? He is a patriotic Nigerian we know very well so why look for another person that will be new on the job? I call on the president to reappoint him so that he can continue with his good job for the country to move forward.
