FORMER Nigeria U17 Head Coach, Emmanuel Amunike has expressed confidence in the handlers of the Golden Eaglets to deliver ahead of their opening game at the FIFA U17 World Cup against Hungary tonight. Amunike said that Nigeria is capable of winning the tournament again but it would depend on teamwork and the players sticking to the game plan. “These coaches handling the team currently were coaching members of my team while I was in charge of the Golden Eaglets, I trust they know what to do,” Amunike said. Coach Emmanuel Amunike won Nigeria her fifth U17 World Cup at the 2015 tournament in Chile. Meanwhile, Golden Eaglets goalkeeper Daniel Jinadu wants his teammates to play as a team as the U17 side looks to win a record sixth title in Brazil. Stephen, who plays in England for West Ham, is looking forward to the Golden Eaglets’ first Group B match against Hungary at the Estádio Olímpico, Goiânia and reckons that they will pick up all three points so long as they play as a team “The game will be interesting today, we hope to win if we play like a team. We play from the defence and we coordinate ourselves together down to the midfield,” said Stephen who has been handed the number one jersey. “We attack, pass the ball together, we score together. We hope to beat Hungary today.”
