 THE NationSport has exclusively confirmed from Germany-based sports apparel manufacturer Puma that it has entered into sponsorship deal with the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN). Speaking through its Senior Manager Corporate Communications, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Puma said that the deal came into being during the just concluded IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar. Responding to enquiry by NationSport on Monday, Robert-Jan Bartunek said: “Thank you for reaching out to PUMA. Yes, as you could see at the World Championships in Doha, PUMA has a deal with the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN).” However, the details of the contract are still sketchy as the Puma spokesperson simply said: “Unfortunately, we do not comment on the specific details of such agreements.” President of AFN Ibrahim Guasua at the weekend said the federation had signed an agreement with Puma with no specific details about the nature of the deal despite the fact that the German multinational company kitted Team Nigeria at the World Athletics Championship in Doha. Meanwhile, our correspondent gathered that the deal would last for four years with an option of renewal. With this new deal, Nigeria athletes will don  the gears of  Puma  to major tournaments including the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, African Games as well as World Championships for the next four years. Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world and it was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler.
