 SUPER Eagles midfielder Ogenyi Onazi may be back in action sooner than expected as he returns to full training with his Trabzonspor teammates after 10 months injury, NationSport reports. The Nigeria international, who uploaded a video of his training where he participated in a five-aside Tiki-taka session with teammates at the Mehmet Ali Yilmaz Facilities, hinted that he will only take some weeks to be fit for matches. The Tiki-taka is a Spanish style of play in football characterized by short passing and movement, working the ball through various channels, and maintaining possession. “Steady progress… Tiki taka…Make it easy for them…#someweekstogo #sonofgrace @ivanildo_14_fernandes I hear you say what?,” he posted along with the video. It would be recalled that Onazi  suffered the injury in a Turkish Super Lig clash between Trabzonspor and Caykur Rizespor on December 23, 2018  with  confirmation that  he torn his Achilles. He had an operation the following day and had since undergone rehabilitation under the supervision of the club’s doctor, Hakan Ayaz. The injury setback saw the 26-year-old miss out of the bronze-winning Super Eagles squad at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Trabzonspor will be having five matches in November and all things being equal, the former Lazio midfielder may recover on time to help his team in the League and UEFA Champions League campaign.
