VICTOR AKANDE, JOE AGBRO, DUPE AYINLA-OLASUNKANMI, OLAITAN GANIU ACTRESS cum singer,  Bisola Aiyeola,  has called on fans to plead with actress friend,  Adesua Etomi,  to reactivate her Instagram page. Posting a scene from a forthcoming movie, ‘Sugar Rush’, slated to be released in December, she stated: “Hey Fan, This is just a little reminder that @sugarrushmovie will be out in cinemas on the 25th of December. Fam, at this point of the shoot we had lost our voices. Good people of this world please tell @adesuaetomi to activate her page. @bimboademoye I miss youuuuuu.” The movie also features Bimbo Ademoye. In a reply to the post, Ademoye wrote: “Sister Shola. whyyyyy. Sister Susie. Activate oooo. Love you sisters”. It will be recalled that in September, the actress and wife of singer and music producer, Banky W, deleted her Instagram account in an unannounced move which left many surprised. While no reason has since been given for the actress’s  sudden disappearance from the social media platform, it is believed that the break might be linked to a photo where the actress was spotted at an event with a baby bump.
