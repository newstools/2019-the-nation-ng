The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) in Kano State has said the government would need over N160 billion to properly execute its free and compulsory education policy. Secretary of the PTA, Aminu Tafida, disclosed this during a radio programme ‘Duniyarmu a Yau’. Tafida said the amount, which is more than half of the state’s 2019 budget, would meet all the requirements of the policy for both primary and secondary schools. Last December, the Kano State House of Assembly passed the N219.97 billion budget presented by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Giving a breakdown of the funds needed, the PTA chair said primary schools need at least N85 billion to run effectively, while secondary schools require N75 billion. According to him, the association would not stop collecting its dues from the pupils, despite of an order from the state government stopping the collection of levies in schools. Tafida said parents would continue to pay N100 every term for primary school pupils and N200 for those in secondary schools as PTA dues. However, the Chairman of Kano State Secondary School Management Board, Alhaji Danlami Hayyo said the state would not relent in its quest to provide free education to its children in the state. He said the introduction of the free education policy would contribute immensely to the development of schools in Kano, adding that parents should assist the government to realise the goal.
