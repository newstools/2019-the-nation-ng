A seven-man kidnapping squad that has been terrorising residents of Ajowa, Akunnu and Akuga in Akoko area of Ondo State were at the weekend arrested through a combined effort of soldiers, police and Department of State Security Service (DSS) at Ajowa in Akoko Northwest local government area. They were apprehended  after abducting a 45-year-old graduate teacher and Muslim cleric, Alhaji Jamiu Zakariyahu,  at gunpoint while coming from a mosque where he usually led the congregation at Daja-Ajowa. It was learnt that the suspected kidnappers dragged the victim from his motorcycle and immediately covered his face with mask, leading him into the bush. Narrating his ordeal, Zakariyahu said, “after dragging me into the bush, I met two other victims whose legs and hands were tied and blindfolded. “They demanded a ransom of N10m, which was later reduced to N5m.” However, when the negotiating team told them (culprits) that the victim was a teacher whose family could not afford more than N250,000,  they consequently agreed. But miraculously in the night of second day in captivity, he said the rope already tied on his two hands suddenly cut off, while he untied that of his two legs as the kidnappers slept off. He said,”I then escaped in the midnight to an unknown destination in the dark forest where God directed me to meet a local hunter, who was searching for games. “It was some soldiers with the help of some locals that later arrested one Wasiu Mohammed, son of a prominent chief in the town, by tracking the phone the bandits earlier seized from me.” According to the victim, the arrested Wasiu is the leader of the squad, who paved way for the arrest of three others, while the remaining ones were still at large.
