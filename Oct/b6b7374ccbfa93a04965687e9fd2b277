WHEN Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets begin their quest for a record-extending win of the U17 World Cup in Brazil today facing Hungary at 9pm Nigerian time, it will be a re-enactment of their quarterfinal match 34 years ago when the Nigerians first won the trophy in China. It has been 34 years since Nigeria shocked the sporting world to become the first country outside South America and Europe to win a global football tournament. Coincidentally, it is also 34 years since Hungary last featured in the tournament after they were eliminated 3-1 by Nigeria in the quarter finals. Nigeria’s assistant coach, Nduka Ugbade was a star player in the Nigerian side, captaining the team to win the inaugural edition of the tournament. For Hungary, they should indeed be hungry for action after returning to the competition since their only appearance in the 1985 edition. They are beginning from where they ended – a clash with Nigeria. In that encounter, they were almost upsetting the Nigerian side after Eaglets made a disastrous start. Goalkeeper Lucky Agbonsevafe completely fumbled a free kick to give Hungary a good start after just two minutes. Nigeria eventually turned the game around with a brace by Bella Momoh and another goal by Victor Igbinoba to get a 3-1 win. Can the victory be replicated at Estádio Olímpico, Goiania in Brazil today? The Golden Eaglets will also attempt to regain their esteem after missing in action in 2017.
