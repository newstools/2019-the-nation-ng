The running mate to late Prince Abubakar Audu during the 2015 Kogi governorship election, Hon. James Faleke, has confirmed that he will support the reelection bid of Governor Yahaya Bello in the November 16 poll. Pictures of Faleke and Governor Bello, together with his running went, Chief Edward Onoja, taken together, in Abuja, had gone viral earlier on Sunday. Faleke said it was true that he had agreed to support Bello’s reelection bid. He said: “Yes. Following the decision of the leadership of Audu/Faleke group to work with the governor, and as loyal party men and women, I on behalf of the group, met with the governor, to chart the way forward and build a strong and united APC, before the election. “We have put all issues in the past, and also, will be in a better position to always assist and advise the party and government in the state to execute people friendly programs.” He said that since he has returned to Lagos, it will be bad of him not to align the members of the Audu/Faleke group with the government and the main politics of the state. “It is therefore necessary, as loyal party members, to assist, by bringing the party faithfuls who have been with me through tick and thin in the last four years, to the governor. “By the Grace of God, We will arrange to hand them over at a future meeting, as soon as possible. Even though I have no vote in Kogi, I have numerous followers in the state. “Let us be clear that, though I have no vote in Kogi State, but I have massive followership and have a strong voice which will be seen in the outcome of the elections,” he said. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mohammed Onogu, in a statement said that the decision was arrived at meeting between Faleke and the governor and his running mate, Edward Onoja.
