The founder and General Overseer of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Warrior for Christ Mission, Prophet Dr Solomon Ajao (JP) has called on the federal government to declare national days of fasting and prayers. He said this was necessary to attract God mercies and save the country from further deterioration Speaking with reporters at the headquarters of the church at in Fagba, Lagos Ajao Lamented that many infrastructure like roads, education, power, the health sector etc were calling for urgent attention. According to him: “instead of leaders and people of Nigeria to emulate the people of Nineveh, announce days of fasting and prayers to seek the face of God and repent of their wrong doings, they have continued to multiply in their sins of stealing or treasury looting, murder of innocent souls, frauds now fashionable in the realm of billions of naira and hard currencies.” Ajao likened the economy to fly or an insect caught in the web of the spider, noting the more the insect struggled for freedom, the tighter its situation becomes until the spider picked it for food. He declared this was why the economy seemed to have defiled all known logic. “Nigeria is like the people of Sodom and Gomorah, always increasing in sins. “Her sins have attracted the wrath of God who had promised not to listen to the prayers and fasting of ‘hired’ men of God; the only prayers God can reckon with is that from the repentant hearts of the generality of Nigerian people,” Ajao noted. He pointed out that leaders oppressed the masses such that God became angry with the nation and leaders.
