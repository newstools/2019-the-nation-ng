BUNDESLIGA giants Bayern Munich are tracking Nigeria international Victor Osimhen, according to reports in France. The German champions and AC Milan are monitoring the performances of the Lille striker ahead of a possible move . The Bavarians are in the market for a striker as replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who is widely regarded as the best number nine in the world and has been linked with a move to Real Madrid in the January transfer window. Since the beginning of last season, Osimhen is beginning to fulfil his potential and his goal scoring form for Sporting Charleroi saw him earn a transfer to Lille in August 2019. The 20-year-old began his professional career at VfL Wolfsurg, making 16 appearances in total for the Bundesliga outfit before he was loaned out to Sporting Charleroi for the entirety of the 2018-2019 season. Osimhen has scored 28 goals since moving to Europe and 20 of those came in the colours of Sporting Charleroi.
