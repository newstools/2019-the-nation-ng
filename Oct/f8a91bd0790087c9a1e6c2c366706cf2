 Telecoms giant, MTN  Nigeria and Dangote Group, have emerged the most valuable brands in Nigeria, according to   the Top 50 Brand survey. While Dangote topped the list, it was followed by MTN. Globacom came third in the chart. The top brands and category leaders will be honoured at the #IAMBRANDNIGERIA award and gala in Lagos on November 30. Dangote industry again took the lead this year following its last year’s feat. This made Dangote double as the Most Valuable overall and Nigeria brand in the 2019 review. Dangote is the most diversified and largest conglomerate in West Africa and one of the largest in the continent. The Chief Executive Officer/Country Director, Top 50 Brands Nigeria, Taiwo Oluboyede, said Dangote Cement, a member of the group is the most capitalised company on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). “Dangote is expected to deliver its 650,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity crude oil refinery with the world tallest atmospheric tower in the coming year,” he said, adding that MTN, despite  its negative narratives, has continued to grow stronger, maintaining its second placement in the annual ranking. The brand has been the largest telecom and business service provider in the country. “The brand enjoys more local affinity with the public listing and the trading of its stocks earlier in the year. Following its listing on the floor of the NSE, MTN has been the second most capitalised company on the exchange. It is first telecommunication network service provider to be listed on the NSE premium board. By this also, MTN Nigeria is the Most Valuable Multinational in Nigeria for the year,” Oluboyede said.
