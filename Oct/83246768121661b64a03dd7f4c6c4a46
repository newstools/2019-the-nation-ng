Serge Gnabry scored four goals as Bayern Munich destroyed Tottenham Hotspur with a 7-2 victory at the White Hart lane, in the UEFA Champions League. Son Heung-min scored the first goal for Spurs before Joshua Kimmich’s curling 25-yard equaliser. Robert Lewandowski put Bayern ahead before two Gnabry goals, after a surging run and then via the post. Harry Kane gave Spurs hope with a penalty but Gnabry scored two more fine goals either side of Lewandowski’s second as Spurs imploded. It is the first time in Tottenham’s 137-year history that they have ever conceded seven goals at home in any competition. Spurs are third in Group B on one point, having drawn 2-2 with Olympiakos in their opening game. Substitute Raheem Sterling scored one goal and made the other as Manchester City eventually overcame Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League. City missed chance after chance and took until the 66th to break the deadlock as Sterling converted Riyad Mahrez’s cutback 10 minutes after coming on. Phil Foden came off the bench in stoppage time and coolly rolled in a low finish from Sterling’s lay-off. Before then, Sergio Aguero had a one-on-one effort saved by Dominik Livakovic and blazed over from 10 yards, while Bernardo Silva volleyed over from a promising position.
