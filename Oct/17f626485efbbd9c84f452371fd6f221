 Ten policemen drawn from various Explosive Ordnance Disposals (EODs) as well as Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) units across the country were at the weekend certified fit to handle mobile radiation detection systems for combating nuclear threats. Their certification followed a week-long training conducted by the United States Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence (US-DOE/NSDD). One official each from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA) was also among those certified as experts in the field at an event held in Lagos. The Nation, last week, reported that the U.S donated two new mobile detection systems to the Police EOD to enhance proactive national security framework for early detection, analysis and report of smuggled radioactive materials into the country. The donation, which was facilitated by the ONSA and NNRA, it was gathered, was part of a Nuclear Security Detection Architecture (NSDA) emplaced to check unauthorised acts. Congratulating the beneficiaries for being the first set of officers to receive such training in-country, Commissioner of Police, EOD, Maikudi Shehu said other relevant government agencies would benefit from the same security arrangement in the nearest future. Shehu, who was represented by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), EOD, Ibrahim Jibrin, said the training had enriched the technical capability of EOD in nuclear security in line with global best practices. “We are committed to ensure that internal security threats are reduced to the nearest minimum through improved efforts and by initiating new strategies driven by technology,” he said. Shehu urged the beneficiaries to judiciously apply the skills they acquired in the fight against security threats, acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.
