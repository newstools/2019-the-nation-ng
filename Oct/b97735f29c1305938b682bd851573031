The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has reiterated the need for pensioners and Next-of-Kins (NoKs) to be alert on the activities of fraudsters who target pensioners to defraud them of their hard-earned pensions by texting or calling them, soliciting money to facilitate their pension payments. Its Executive Secretary, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme, in a statement, stated that PTAD staff members would never demand money from any pensioner or NoK before their pensions are processed and paid. She said there were no intermediaries in the pension payments, noting that pensioners are paid directly through GIFMIS platform into individual pensioner’s account. She advised pensioners to be aware of fraudsters who sometime posed as PTAD staff members to defraud them. She said the Directorate embarked on  campaigns to protect the pensioners and to expose pranks employed by the fraudsters to swindle uninformed pensioners.
