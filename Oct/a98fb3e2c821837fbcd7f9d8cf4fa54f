Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa was a committed leader, an Afenifere and a progressive who fought for what he believed in, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said. Tinubu, in his condolence message, Saturday on the demise of Akinfenwa, recalled the immense contribution of the deceased to the building of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999. He said: “he was a founding member of AD who helped to lay the building blocks for the party. A patriot, who was proudly Ijesa and Yoruba, but equally committed to Nigeria, and contributed his own quota to the development of the country. “For his patriotism, principled politics and for fighting for causes he believed in, he would be sorely missed. We thank God that he enjoyed good health and lived to an advanced age of 89. “My condolences to his family, both immediate and extended, to the Afenifere family, to the Ijesa people, to the government and people of Osun State, and to Nigerians generally, for losing a good family man, leader and fine politician. I hope and pray that his ideals do not die with him. May God in his infinite mercies grant him eternal rest.” Akinfenwa represented Osun East in the Senate between 1999 and 2003 on the platform of the AD. He died on Thursday in his Ibadan home.
