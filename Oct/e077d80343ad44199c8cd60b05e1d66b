THE Maye of Yorubaland and the Chancellor of Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu, Ife North Local Government, Osun State, Dr. Ramon Atobatele Adedoyin has advised Yoruba monarchs to emulate the Ooni of Ife,  Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja 11. Adedoyin, while congratulating the Ooni  on the success of the just concluded annual Olojo Festival, said Ooni  had raised the bar of the annual Olojo festival. He advised other Yoruba traditional rulers to also borrow a leaf from the Ooni by promoting different festivals that will sell Yoruba cultural values to the whole world. Maye believes that with the popularity which the festival has gained through the efforts of  the Ooni , “the festival is growing to become a world renowned festival and  Ile-Ife will soon become another Jerusalem that many will be visiting on pilgrimage. People are going to Israel , Saudi Arabia, what prevents the world from coming to Ile- Ife, the historical facts are just here?” Adedoyin who is also the President of Ile-Ife Royal Brothers Club, however advised the Ooni to distance himself from sycophants. The Maye disclosed his plan to establish a business worth 100million naira for the Ife youths in the name of Ile-Ife.
