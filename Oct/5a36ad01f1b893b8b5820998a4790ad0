Akeem Lawal  NATIONAL super featherweight champion, Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola, said his next target was to secure his fifth professional victory when he takes on Sikiru ‘Omo Iya Eleja’ Shogbesan at the GOtv Boxing Night 20 slated for the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium in Lagos on October 12 . Oyekola, who dethroned long-reigning champion, Taofeek ‘Taozon’ Bisuga at the GOtv Boxing Night 18 held in Ibadan, said he won’t leave anything to chances as he will be going for a knock-out early in the match. “I am really focused on my next match,” said the self-styled Scorpion, who has four wins and a draw record. “ I have been training very hard because I don’t want to disappoint my fans; I defeated Bisuga in front of my fans in Ibadan and this time around I am going to beat Shogbesan in front of my fans in Lagos. GOtv Boxing Night 20 will be headlined by the much anticipated pairing of ABU lightweight king, Oto ‘Joe Boy’ Joseph, and WABU champion, Rilwan ‘Real One’ Oladosu, who face each other in the ABU title bout. Also on the card is the national bantamweight title bout between Sadiq Adeleke and Opeyemi ‘Sense’ Adeyemi. Other bouts include a national light heavyweight challenge bout between Adewale ‘Masevex’ Masebinu and Kabiru “KB Godson Towolawi; and a national featherweight challenge bout between Tope ‘TP Rock’ Musa and Olusegun ‘Embargo’ Moses. Two debutants, Alaba “Eye Blow” Omotola and Bolaji Abdullahi, both graduates of GOtv Boxing NextGen Search, will also be in action in addition to an all-female bout featuring Cynthia “Bobby Girl” Ogunsemilore and Aminat “Smart” Yekini.
