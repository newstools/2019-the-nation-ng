THE importance of efficient planning and allocation of resources in any organised society cannot be underestimated and should be taken with all seriousness, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said. He said the creation of Lagos State Residents’ Registration Agency (LASRRA) is for data capturing, which would later be translated to building database of people who reside in the state. He made spoke in Lagos through the agency’s  General Manager, Engr. (Mrs.) Ibilola Kasunmu during a fact finding meeting with all the Divisional Supervisors and Station Managers of Local Council Development Areas in the state. She said the governor is poised to “walk his talk” on allocation of resources and support for demographic planning in the state. She sought the cooperation of all staff of the agency to achieving this. She said: “LASRRA is information technology (IT) based and as such, the staff should be ready to move with time. The process of data capturing will be updated and upgraded; it is important for us all to embrace change and follow the pace, for the only thing that is constant in life is change and we should all be ready to accept and adjust to it so that we can as a fortified team achieve success.” She urged the supervisors, station managers and mobile team to work hard so as to achieving good result. “Reinforce those that are lagging behind, share what you know and don’t try to shine alone,” she added. However, all the divisional heads; Ikorodu, Badagry, Ikeja, Lagos Island and Epe and Station Managers were quick to identify what their issues are and how the agency could be of help. One of the Supervisors; Mr Ajayi Abiodun from Ikeja Local Government Division on behalf of others, appreciated the General Manager for holding the long awaited meeting. He also acknowledged the enthusiasm expressed by Mrs. Kasunmu to move the Agency forward.
