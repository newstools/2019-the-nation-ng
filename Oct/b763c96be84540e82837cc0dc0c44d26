 Interswitch has completed N23 billion Series 1 Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured Callable Bonds issue. This followed the registration of a N30 billion debt issuance programme with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SEC),. The bond was issued via a Special Purpose Vehicle , Interswitch Africa One Plc. The Series 1 Issue priced at 15 per cent was 2.6 times  subscribed. The seven-year bonds, embedding a call option that can only be exercised from the second year, are payable in full at maturity. An application will be made to list the Bonds on The Nigerian Stock Exchange on receipt of the SEC’s approval of the proposed allotments. Investor participation was restricted to qualified institutional investors as defined by the SEC in Nigeria, with a proposed Bonds allocation of 64 per cent to pension fund managers, seven per cent to asset managers and 22 per cent to commercial banks pending SEC approval. The strong level of over subscription demonstrated investor confidence in the Interswitch brand, business model and long-term strategy, supported by strong domestic ratings from both Agusto & Co. Limited and Moody’s Investor Service. The Founder and CEO, Mitchell Elegbe, commented: “We are delighted to report the success of the first series of Bonds issued under our Programme, especially with the level of interest shown by investors. Diversifying our funding sources through the inclusion of these Bonds will enable us achieve our strategic objectives and vision.” FBNQuest Merchant Bank and Stanbic IBTC Capital acted as Lead Financial Advisors/Issuing Houses and ABSA Capital Markets Nigeria, FCMB Capital Markets, Quantum Zenith Capital & Investments and Rand Merchant Bank Nigeria, as Joint Issuing Houses.
