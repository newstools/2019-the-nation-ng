The Rivers State government has debunked reports that Governor Nyesom Wike sacked his Chief Security Officer (CSO), Promise Wosu, a superintendent of Police. A statement by Wikeâ€™s media aide, Simeon Nwakaudu, said the report was false and should be disregarded. A top official at the Government House said Wike removed Wosu for allegedly absconding with N63 million meant for security chiefs, for four years. Wosu was state commander of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARS) before he was redeployed to the Government House in 2015.
