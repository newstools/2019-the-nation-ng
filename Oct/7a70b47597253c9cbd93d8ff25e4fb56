The police spokesperson said 25 other suspects were arrested for alleged illegal revenue collections. He said the operation was carefully coordinated by the Area Commander, Onitsha, Mr John Obuagbaka. Mohammed, who noted that the security operatives professionally carried out the operations in consonance with the internationally accepted best practices, added that the suspects would be charged to court. “It was a hitch free operation. The command will profile and screen the suspects while those found wanting will be charged to court.
