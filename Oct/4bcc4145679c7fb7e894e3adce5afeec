 GROUPS from the Audu political family have called on the people to ignore the endorsement of Governor Yahaya Bello for a second term, by the running mate to the late Prince Abubukar Audi during the 2015 Kogi governorship election, Hon. James Faleke. Faleke had last week in Lokoja collapsed his Audi/Faleke Group, which had been at loggerheads with the Bello-controlled Kogi State All Progressives Congress (APC), almost from the onset of the party’s victory at the polls. The groups, in a statement yesterday in Lokoja, said the federal lawmaker can only represent the Faleke political family if it exists. In the statement signed by Chief Dare Olatunde, they described Faleke’s endorsement of Bello’s re-election bid, in the name of the Audu/Faleke Group, as a political scam.
