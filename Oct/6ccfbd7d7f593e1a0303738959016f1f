From Mary Oshiokhamele Rector, Federal Polytechnic Ede (FPE), Dr J. T Adekolawole, has stressed the need for alumni associations to come to assist their alma matter. Adekolawole is optimistic that such gesture would assist in the provision of human and material resources to many higher institutions  considering the inadequacy of resources available to them. He spoke at the Forum of Nigerian Polytechnics Alumni Association (FONPAA) meeting, hosted by FPE Alumni Association, and held at S.O Babalola hall in FPE. According to Adekolawole, polytechnics are faced with inadequate fund, students’ accommodation, furniture and fittings as well as books among others. He said: “I want to use this opportunity to inform you that your alma mater needs your support in the provision of some of its inadequate resources.” Represented by Alhaji Isiaka Adelabu, Adekolawole praised FPE Alumni Association for constructing a perimeter fence round the student’s hostel in the south campus, in addition to donations of over 200 ceiling fans to the school. “Education is the most important component of human resources development. It is accorded a pride of place in many countries developmental activities.  There is a tight grip on the budgetary allocations to education at both state and federal government levels; hence the need for active alumni association in all polytechnics to support government in providing facilities for their alma mater.
