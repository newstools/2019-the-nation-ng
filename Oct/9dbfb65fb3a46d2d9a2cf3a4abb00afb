THE social media may be the bastion of fake news and all manner of materials that purists and well-meaning citizens would consider unhealthy for societal growth and development, but as a potpourri of the good, the bad and the ugly, it can also be a veritable source of entertainment, an oasis of smile in the desert of sadness that grips the modern world on a daily basis. From time to time, the social media take on public figures and celebrities, rechristening them on the basis of their manners and mannerisms, comportment and deportment. That was the case with the Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, shortly after he assumed the leadership of the state about three years ago. On the basis of his promise to ensure that residents of the state wake up to see new projects every day, the social media labeled him “the Wake and See Governor.” Only recently, the social media entertained the world with news of President Muhammadu Buhari’s imaginary wedding with the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadia Umar Farouq. The latest butt of the bug is the Lagos State Governor, Babjide Sanwo-Olu, who on the basis of his penchant for gesticulating while speaking was labeled “the Pointing Governor.” And for effect, several pictures of Sanwo-Olu pointing in different directions surfaced on the social media. But rather than take offence, the Governor has taken the label in his stride. And his smart media minders have turned the act of pointing into a symbol of his administrative competence, saying that the governor does not point for the sake of it but does so only when he sees a problem that needs to be fixed. Many, indeed, are the problems calling for the attention of “the point and fix” Governor.
