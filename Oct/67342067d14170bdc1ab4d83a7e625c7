The election petition tribunal sitting in Jos, the Plateau State capital, has upheld the electoral victory of Governor Simon Lalong. It said the petitioners, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship standard-bearer, Senator Jeremiah Useni, failed to prove allegations of electoral fraud beyond reasonable doubt. The runner up in the Plateau governorship election, Senator Useni and the PDP had petitioned the court, claiming to be the winner of the poll, having scored the majority of the votes cast. Senator Useni also claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was wrong to have declared Governor Lalong of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the election. Reading the judgement, which lasted over four hours, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Halima Salami, said the petitions against Governor Lalong’s victory were not strong enough to convince the court to upturn the outcome of the March 2019 governorship election in Plateau State.
