The Kwara State House of Assembly on Thursday denied witch-hunting former Senate President Bukola Saraki. It said its directive on the revocation of a chalet as a gift to Saraki by former Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed belongs to the state government, adding that “there is no evidence that the politician paid for it.” In a statement, the media aide of the Speaker of House of Assembly Yakubu Danladi, Ibrahim Sherif, said the allocation of the posh property to Saraki was in “violent violation” of the Kwara State former governor’s Pension Law 2010, which had already taken care of him within the provisions of the law. The lawmakers are responding to a report in a newspaper (not The Nation) accusing the state government of witch-hunting the Sarakis. The report claimed that the House’s resolution directing the government to reclaim the land on which the late Olusola Saraki erected his political headquarters called Ile Arugbo, was contrary to the promise of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of not witch-hunting anyone. Danladi said Ile Arugbo had been erected on a land originally meant for the expansion of the civil service clinic and phase II of the state government secretariat without any evidence that anyone paid to the government for the land. He said the noise about the affected priorities was politically motivated, as other public properties unlawfully taken over were also being looked into.
