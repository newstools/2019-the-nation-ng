TWO people have been said to have died in a three-hour robbery attack in Gwaraka community in Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State. A number of people were said to have been injured in the attack. The robbers reportedly stormed the community in the early hours of Monday at about 3 am. The Nation gathered that they went from house to house beating and robbing the people. Speaker of the Niger State House of Assembly Hon. Abdullahi Bawa Wuse said residents of the attacked community called him after the robbery. “In Gwaraka community in Tafa local government, armed robbers had a field day as they killed two people when they invaded the village,” he said. “My people called me, they said the robbers began the operation from 3am and moved from house to house. Two people were killed.” The Speaker also lamented the lack of security in the community stating that in the raid of over three hours, no security was at hand to help the community. “It is not fair that there is no police station in this community. Even the outstation has only two policewomen and what could they have done in a situation like this?” “We cannot continue to lose lives resulting from banditry, kidnapping, and robbery. The security situation in the state is getting out of hand and we need to find a way of addressing it. “We must stand up as a state to collectively fight this menace, we cannot continue to allow it to happen. Our people cannot continue to suffer and face these problems all the time.” The state police command confirmed the attack and the two fatalities. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abubakar Muhammad in a text message to The Nation said an investigation of the incident had begun.
