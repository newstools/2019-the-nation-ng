Immediate past governor of Imo State and Senator representing Imo West, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has enjoined the Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar to accept the Supreme Court judgment in good fate and “join hands with his brother to move the country forward”. Okorocha in a statement issued by his Special Adviser in Media, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, shortly after the judgment, said that the Presidential Petition Tribunal and the Supreme Court only authenticated President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory, adding that available statistics proved that he won the presidential election in the first place. He, however, saluted Atiku for challenging the outcome of the election to a logical conclusion, adding that his action will help to strengthen the nation’s democracy. According to the statement, “President Buhari won his election looking at the statistics of that poll but the Presidential Tribunal and the Supreme Court only authenticated the victory. “But what Atiku did was also good for our democracy, it helps to strengthen our democracy but I  urge that he now joins hands with his brother, the President to move the nation forward”. Also lauding the Supreme Court ruling, member representing Ohaji-Egbema-Oguta-Oru West Federal Constituency, Hon Kingsley Uju, said that the Supreme Court has performed its constitutional responsibility by affirming the winner of the election based on evidences available to it. Congratulating the President, he tasked Atiku to join hands with the winner of the election in the interest of the nation. The Lawmaker, however, decried the huge resources and time wasted in post-election struggles, adding that litigations constitute huge distractions to people elected into public offices. He said, “as parliamentarians, we are going to be looking into the Electoral Act to make the institutions of INEC to function well because once elections are free and fair, it will go a long way to reduce post election litigations”.
