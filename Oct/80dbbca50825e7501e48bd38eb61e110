Rapper Olanrewaju Pelepele aka Makanaki who recently committed suicide was last Friday given a spectacular farewell by fans and colleagues at a candlelight ceremony held at his hometown in Alimosho, Lagos. Amidst tears and sorrow, the crowd gave the late rapper his last respect. However, his official producer, Dammy BDC of Suplia Studio, revealed that he is currently working on a tribute track for the late rapper. “I produced almost all his songs,” said Dammy BDC. “We have recorded a tribute song for him and the video was shot on Friday. The likes of Adewale, Davolee and Bolaji are coming around and they will be part of the project.” Until his death, the self-acclaimed ‘King of Alimosho’ has been posting series of emotional messages and video on the internet with the #mylastmoment to narrate his disgust for life. He claimed that despite his 10 years of hard work in the music industry, he has failed to make it to the mainstream. The internet was left reeling on Friday, September 20 when the news broke that Pelepele had committed suicide by drinking ‘Sniper’, an insecticide, at his apartment in Ikorodu. He was buried the next day. The late rapper, who incorporated Yoruba and pigin English in his rap in 2012, under the imprint of YBNL, released a single titled, Sinnerman, featuring Olamide and Pheelz. He left the record label for undisclosed reasons to stand on his own. Pelepele released a track, ‘Local Reply’, a retaliation of Olamide verse in rapper Reminiscence’s song, ‘Local Rapper’ featuring Olamide. He did another follow up titled, ‘Fuck Shii’. He said he wished Dagrin was alive and later referred to himself as one-man army. In 2018, he released an Extended Play (EP) titled, ‘Eko State’ where he claimed people can survive in any coast, if they can survive in Lagos. Pelepele hails from Ibadan, Oyo State and attended Saint Anthony’s Grammar School, Ogun State. He later studied Linguistics at the University of Lagos.
