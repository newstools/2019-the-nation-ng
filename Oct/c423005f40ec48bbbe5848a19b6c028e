The Presidency on Tuesday night insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari is not interested in seeking third term in office. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said that President Buhari would leave office at the end of his second term in 2023. He was reacting to media reports on presidential term limits. He said “The Presidency wishes to correct internet-based gossip and un-informed media commentary regarding presidential term limits, given credence by so-called support groups, staging street demonstrations asking President Muhammadu Buhari to do a third term. “There are no circumstances – nor set of circumstances – under which President Buhari may seek to amend the Constitution regarding the two-term term limit on holding office as President. “President Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 – and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate. “There is not even the faintest possibility that this will change. “It is important to note that there was a past attempt to change the Constitution to allow for the-then incumbent president to stand for a third term. That attempt was wrong, unconstitutional – and rightly rebuffed. No such attempt will happen under this President. President Buhari, he noted, is a democrat. “He respects the Constitution. Any activity aimed at altering the two-term limit will not succeed and shall never have his time nor support.” he stated
