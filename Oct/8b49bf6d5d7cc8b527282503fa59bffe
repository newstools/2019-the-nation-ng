A nursing mother whose name cannot be immediately ascertained has been reportedly being kidnapped in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. The incident, sources in the area disclosed took place at Umuebeke in Aba South Local Government Area of the state at about 1 am. The woman whose husband was said to be a scrap dealer was said to have been taken away from her residence, leaving her newborn twin babies with the husband. It was learnt that the gunmen who gained entrance into the compound after breaking the fence have contacted the family and were making demands of N3million before they could release the nursing mother. A source close to the family who couldn’t confirm if any ransom was paid, told our reporter that the victim’s family dropped the sum of N50, 000 to the kidnappers at Umugo, a community of about 10-15 minutes-drive from the place of the incident. According to the source, the kidnappers claimed that the N50, 000 was the money that they used in treating the nursing mother who took ill in their custody. “Life has been the same for the family. They have been living in fears every day. The children are sick because they have not been able to suck their mother’s breast since she was taken away from their house. “The husband is begging them for the release of the wife. He said that he can no longer cope with handling the twins alone. Each day without their mum is making them sick.” But a member of the security outfits in Aba who craved anonymity told our reporter that the nursing mother at the time of filing this report has been reunited with the family and denied that the family paid any ransom for her release.
