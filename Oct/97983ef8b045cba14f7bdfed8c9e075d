Maker of organic skincare and hair products, Avila Naturalle, is set to hold its 2019 Avila dinner and awards night in Lagos on November 9, 2019. The founder of Avila Naturalle, Mrs Temitope Mayegun, said that 300 distributors are set to receive awards at Oriental Hotel, Lagos. “The Avila awards is all about appreciating our distributors,” he said. “We feel the way to appreciate their hard work is to reward them by giving them the awards and also other gifts. That is what Avila does every year and we’re committed to sustaining it.” Expected are distributors from other countries including Ghana, UK, and US. The first edition of the awards took place last year. As a way of giving back to the society, Avila Naturalle recently embarked on a campaign about the dangers of using chemical-based soaps and creams in some schools and hospitals in Lagos “The CSR is basically going to schools and telling them about the importance of maintaining their natural skin texture and impress upon them that they dont need to alter their skin color to look beautiful, you know, and also let them know about the dangers in tampering into chemicalised products that damage the skin. We also went to the hospitals and gave free coconut oil to mothers, to babies. Its just our way of giving back to the society.” Expanding beyond cosmetics, Avila Naturalle has finalised plans to begin the production of food supplements by the first quarter of next year.
