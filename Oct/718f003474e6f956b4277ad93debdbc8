Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation Dr Frederic Oladeinde has urged Lagosians to obey the state’s traffic laws and support ongoing reforms in the transport sector. This, he said, is to rid the state of gridlock. In a statement to mark his birthday today, Dr. Oladeinde said the best birthday wishes he would  appreciate  from Lagosians is when they allow free flow of traffic. He said the state will tomorrow hold a stakeholders’ meeting to unveil the government plans for achieving an improved traffic management system that will reduce productive human hours daily lost to traffic jam. Oladeinde added that the stakeholders’ meeting would also address major contributing factors to gridlock in the metropolis and how to improve on them for greater economic prosperity for the state. The commissioner noted that successive administrations had devised strategies such as the establishment of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority,(LASTMA), Lagos State Metropolitan Traffic Management Agency,( LAMATA), Bus Rapid Transport (BRT), Light Rail System, Modern Ferry Service, Traffic Radio Station and others to tackle the menace of gridlock  in the metropolis.  .
