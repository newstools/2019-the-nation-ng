4G LTE pioneer service provider in West Africa, Smile Nigeria, has unveiled a campaign designed to give brand new SMIFI and Router devices to its loyal customers. The offer is for customers that have spent a minimum of 12 months on its network. Its Head of Brands and Communication, Lotanna Anajemba, said to be qualified, customers who have spent the required minimum also must have good data usage history andÂ  bring their old SMiFi or Router device in exchange for the new device. Anajemba said eligible customers could only benefit from the offer once a year and would need to update their Know Your Customer (KYC) record with Smile to enable them get notification for the offer. The lucky customers will be contacted via SMS and email and requested to visit their nearest Smile shop or kiosk nationwide to claim their new device. An aspect of the programme is that it offers the customer a router or SMiFi device at no extra cost. However, customers will have to trade in their old device for the new one. It primarily rewards loyalty and is available in all the major cities in which Smile operates.
