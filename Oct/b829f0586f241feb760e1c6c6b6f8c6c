The Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, Lagos, will host the first Alexander von Humboldt Kollege International Conference from October 16 -19. The three-day conference has theme, “From basic sciences to Translational Research: The journey so far in Nigeria.” The conference seeks to bring together scientists from Germany and Nigeria. It aims to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, with the aim of providing knowledge exchange opportunities. The conveners said the conference would generate collaboration under the concept of translational research to solve problems, thereby fostering an environment of communication and cooperation between basic and clinical scientists. These would, they said, foster multi-and interdisciplinary collaborations. The Humboldt Kolleg is a regional and expert conference for Humboldtians sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. It aims to strengthen regional and professional networking between its alumni and spark junior researchers’ interest in Alexander von Humboldt Foundation programmes with Germany as a research location. The conference’s chief host is Prof. Babatunde Salako, Director-General, NIMR, while the convener is Dr. Stella Smith, director of research at NIMR. Dignitaries expected include Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu as special guest of honour; Dr. Stefan Traumann, consular-general, Federal Republic of Germany; Prof Akin Abayomi, Lagos State Commissioner for Health; Prof. O. G. Ademowo and Prof. Clement Adebooye, among others. The conference will feature 13 plenary lectures, two keynote addresses, 38 oral and 21 poster presentations. Also expected at the event are 100 participants among whom are highly respected Humboldtians in various academic fields, junior researchers, among others.
