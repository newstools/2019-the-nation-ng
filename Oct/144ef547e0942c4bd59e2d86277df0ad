THE first runner-up in the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election in Kogi State, Mr. Babatunde Irukera, has asked his supporters to vote for the party’s governorship candidate, Yahaya Bello, in the coming governorship election. This was made known to reporters by his ally and former aide to Governor  Bello, Mal. Abdulmalik Suleiman. According to him, Irukera ordered his supporters to stop throwing tantrums at the party. He said he is a national leader and a great believer in the party and will not support any action that will derail the victory of the party in the coming governorship election. Suleiman added :“I respect Irukera so  much. He values character over pedigree, and he hates cynics. “He believes public service is noble and necessary. That one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values. “He is a principled and a straightforward politician that holds no ill feeling towards anyone. He listens to everybody’s complaints. Above all, he loves work and prays.”. But in a sharp contrast to Irukera’s opinion, Mal. Suleiman insisted that he and some supporters have decided to work for the PDP. He said Kogi needs to be delivered from the hands of Governor Bello. He said the issue at hand is bigger than party politics, but the people. He said after his discussions with his boss, “I said to myself that on Kogi I stand and with the people.”
