Air Warriors Women team continued from where they finished at the Abuja Zone of this year’s Zenith Bank Basketball League as they whipped Adamawa Super Flames in the four quarters to lead the Savannah Conference. The Air Warriors coached by Samson Sotiminu drubbed the Adamawa Babes 25-3, 49-14, 68-21 and 80-24 to establish the lead at the Conference. “Our goal is to go all out and clinch the title for the first time. We are prepared but we know it is not going to be easy but we are prepared for it,” Sotiminu said after the victory. Also through yesterday are the Nigeria Customs ladies who narrowly defeated Plateau Rocks 53-49 and Blackgold Queens who defeated a sloppy Nigeria Army side 73-60. Meanwhile, the League continues on Wednesday with Plateau Rocks playing Adamawa Flames while Blackgold Queens take on Air Warriors. The other two matches are between Kaduna Angels and Nigeria Customs while Nigeria Army slug it out with Taraba Hurricanes in the last match of the day.
