An unidentified male was found dead early Friday near the Warri Playground, off Upper Erejuwa Road, Warri in Delta state. The Nation gathered that the incident leading to the death may have occurred the previous evening. The deceased was said to have blood stains from a wound on the side of his body. Residents around the area expressed shock over the development. According to a businessman, who chose to remain anonymous, the body may have been dragged and dumped there. “I left here by 6:30pm yesterday but there was no dead body. The kind of injuries you see all over the body seems to look like that of some one dragged on the ground  from another place to this area. “I came this morning and saw the dead body. the police have been coming and going since I opened my office. I don’t know what they are doing. Maybe they they want to remove the body,” the man said. But a tricycle passenger, simply identified as Uzor told The Nation that the body appears to have been stabbed around the rib area. He said: “I have passed here several times this morning. He is a fair skinned boy. From what I saw, the guy was stabbed on his side because you will see a lot of blood on that part.” A young man residing in the area further disclosed that about 8pm , he had gone out to buy some yam fries only to discover that “unlike before, the whole place was empty. The usual bustling around that time was missing. Now, I’m sure this must have caused it.” The body has since been evacuated by Policemen of the ‘B’ Division, Warri. The Delta State Police Command could not comment on the development. Calls put across to the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya, did not go through.
