NIGERIA have been running the rule over 21-year-old hotshot Ike Ugbo who has caught the eye after making a prolific start to his loan spell at Roda JC this season. Ugbo scored his fifth goal in just eight appearances, six of which have been starts, for the Dutch side at Telstar on Friday night and Nigeria had officials at the game to watch him having stepped up their interest. Striker Ugbo was born in Lewisham, south London and is eligible for Nigeria through his parents. He has played for England at Under-17 and Under-20 level, helping the latter squad win the 2017 Toulon Tournament. Nigeria were dealt a blow last week when Ugbo’s Stamford Bridge team-mate Tammy Abraham was recalled to the England squad when they were hoping to persuade him to switch allegiance. Ugbo has shown admirable maturity by refusing to let a bizarre pay dispute disrupt his scoring form and is determined to continue making his mark in Holland. It emerged last week that Roda had been using money sent by Chelsea to cover their portion of Ugbo’s wages to pay the rest of their squad last month.
