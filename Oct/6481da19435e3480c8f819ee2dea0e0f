Alao Abiodun  Mercy a.k.a. Lambo is the last woman standing among the BBNaija Pepper Dem housemates. She is to compete for the N60million worth of prizes alongside fellow male housemates Frodd, Seyi, Mike and Omashola. Mercy’s time in the house so far has not been without drama particularly the moment when she had to be physically restrained during a row with now disqualified housemate, Tacha. Besides the drama, Mercy has proven herself to be goal-driven, from winning the HoH challenge down to the tasks prepared by the sponsors. She is also known for her ever-changing style and sense of humour, our reporter had observed. Mercy is perceived as one of, if not the strongest housemate in the final five by a lot of observers. For every time she was put up for eviction during the show, the numbers she got reflected on how strong she is, making her one of the strongest housemates in the house. The grand finale of the reality TV show is expected to hold LIVE on Sunday, October 6, as #BBNaija fans will get to experience an intense conclusion of the show after voting massively for the housemate of their choice. The show, which kicked off with 21 housemates, later welcomed additional 5 housemates as it progressed. Following weeks of nominations and evictions, only five housemates – Mercy, Frodd, Seyi, Mike and Omashola – remain Biggie’s tenants till this weekend.
