Adamu Suleiman, Sokoto Senator Aliyu Wamakko has said nothing will be left to chance by the Sokoto State All Progressives Congress (APC) in its bid to reclaim its alleged stolen governorship mandate. Wamakko, who represents Sokoto North in the Senate, added that the party’s alleged stolen mandate would be retrieved through legal means. The former governor spoke at the weekend at his Gawon Nama home in Sokoto while addressing the party’s supporters, who organised a reception for him on his return from Abuja. Recalling the strides recorded by the party in its political journey in the state, Wamakko said: “The people have massively voted for the party, but their mandate has been stolen. We are exploring available legal means to reclaim it. “I am, however, appealing to our supporters to remain prayerful and patient, as their efforts will not be in vain.” Wamakko, who is also the deputy chairman, Senate Committee on Anti- Corruption, advised the party members to remain calm, peaceful and law-abiding. The Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi, praised the supporters for their perseverance, saying: “The mammoth crowds have shown the strength of the party in the state and the undeniable fact that Sokoto is fully for APC.” APC governorship candidate Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto expressed happiness that no member of the party had dumped it in the last seven months. He said the judgment of the Election Petition Tribunal on the party’s petition was a travesty of justice. APC Chairman Alhaji Isa Achida said the state belonged to the party. He urged the supporters to remain resolute.
