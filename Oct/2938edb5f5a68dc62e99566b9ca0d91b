It was gathered that some of the victims had been chained since 2014 at the place called Blessings of Godness Healing Church in Isheri Osun, Egbe Idimu. It was gathered that some of the victims had suffered certain health challenges which their families termed spiritual and dumped them at the facility for divine healing. At the time of this report, 12 of the victims had been rescued while efforts were on to evacuate the rest. It was gathered that some of the victims could barely walk and were assisted out first.
