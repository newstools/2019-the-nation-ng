The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) said over 5.68 million individuals have been reached through radio, television and social media to end Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria. The UN agency said that 5,094 girls were reached through sensitisation in primary and secondary schools and empowered with change agents in partnership with existing school clubs. UNICEF FGM Consultant in Imo and Ebonyi states, Mr Ben Mbakwem, spoke yesterday at the 7th quarterly meeting of Imo State Technical Committee (STC) on FGM Abandonment. It was organised by the Imo State Ministry of Gender and Vulnerable Group Affairs in collaboration with UNICEF, UNFPA and National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Owerri. Represented by the Director of Gender Affairs in the state’s Ministry of Gender, Dr Blessing Azubuike, Mbakwem said  3,903 girls and women had also received health, social and legal services. He noted that the figures covered the five states of Imo, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Osun and Oyo covered by NOA and UNICEF as states with the most prevalent in FGM. Mbakwem said that UNFPA- UNICEF 2018 Joint Report indicated that 18 per cent of girls and women in Nigeria aged 15 to 49 years had undergone FGM, while over 14.8 million girls were at risk between 2015 and 2030. He said a lot of progress had been made since Nigeria joined other countries on the joint programme on FGM abandonment. Mbakwem said that already, 415 communities had made public declaration of FGM abandonment with sustained FGM discussion in the Annual Women’s Home and Abroad Meeting (August Meeting) and inclusion of FGM in the “New Yam Festival” in the Southeast.
