Augustine Okezie, Katsina Some displaced 2018 Jibia flood victims have been commending the Katsina State government for its decision to build 400 houses for them at a new location. 64-year-old bricklayer, Lawale Ibrahim, who is currently squatting with a relation in a nearby village, told this medium that the decision has portrayed the state government as humane and caring. He said, “You can imagine what we have been going through, trying to find shelter; but now God has touched Masari’s government to remember us, one and half years after.” 33-year-old Sanni Yahaya, whose marriage was consummated just two days before the flood, said the decision by the state government is quite commendable. He, however, called for a speedy construction of the houses. Recall that the Katsina State government recently announced plans to relocate and build 400 houses for victims of the 2018 Jibia flood victims, who had their houses submerged or completely swept away by the rampaging flood. Secretary to the Government of the State, Mustapha Mohammed Inuwa, who made the disclosure while inaugurating the committee for the relocation exercise on behalf of Masari, observed that the relocation committee’s existence is long overdue and therefore urged them to work expeditiously to deliver on their expected report. He described the decision to build houses for the flood victims as humanitarian, adding that “Vice President Osibanjo was here on behalf of the president to condole with the victims at the time and he made promises on behalf of the federal government.”
