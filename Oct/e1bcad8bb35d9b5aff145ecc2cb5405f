By Onimisi Alao, Yola Adamawa State has shifted its local government election to December 7, 2019. The local government election intended to pick chairmen and councillors for the 21 LGAs of the state, was earlier scheduled for November 9. The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC), which announced the new date on Friday, said the election timetable has been redrawn accordingly. ADSIEC said in a statement that the postponement is “due to logistics and other problems the commission is facing.” The statement which was signed by the Executive Chairman of the Commission, Isa Shetima, indicated that submission of completed nomination forms will be October 20-25. The timetable also shows that display of names of successfully screened candidates by ADSIEC is November 11-13; while last day allowed for election campaigns is December 6. The 21 local government areas of Adamawa State are currently being run by transitional committees. The committees were inaugurated in July by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri following the passage of a bill to that effect by the state House of Assembly. Fintiri had been quick, after he was sworn in on May 29, to set in motion the process to have effectively administered local government councils. He started with sending to the House of Assembly, the local council transition committees bill that gave rise to the transition committees now running the councils before the council election now to hold in December.
