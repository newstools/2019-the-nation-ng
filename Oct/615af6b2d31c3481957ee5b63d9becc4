The annual national convention of Business and Professional Women Nigeria with the theme “Women and Nigerian politics; yesterday, today and tomorrow” holds in Abuja on November 8. The event, which brings members and dignitaries from all walks of life, would create an opportunity to bring to the front burner, salient and topical issues relating to women. Its National President, Yinka Ajibola, in a statement, explained the event will focus on getting more women interested in mainstream politics as well as x-ray the challenges facing women in politics. “Generally, we find that women are not fully engaged in the art of politics. There are arguments as to the underlying reasons. “The crux of the matter is that we have not started to participate in a significant and meaningful way and the few times that we have done, the results are abysmal,” he stated. Ajibola further explained that impacting on the lives of women and the society in general is something the organisation is passionate about. “Consequently, we feel that as an organisation whose primary focus is “WOMEN”, we shall begin in no small measure, the process of sensitising women on this critical aspect of our human existence.” She added: “We hope that during the conference, there would be multiple opportunities to address some of the critical issues and begin to push for more participation from women on all fronts”. Business and Professional Women (BPW) Nigeria is an affiliate of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women (IFBPW), an influential international network of business and professional women with affiliates in over 100 countries in five continents.
