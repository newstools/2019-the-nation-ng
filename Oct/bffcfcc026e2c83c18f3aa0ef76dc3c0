 THE Kogi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Inspector-General of Police (IG) to investigate the rumour making the rounds that House of Assembly Speaker Mathew Kolawole has brought thugs to the state to unleash mayhem on the electorate. The party, in a statement on Tuesday by the Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola, and made available to journalists, said the party desired a free and fair election on November 16. He said the All Progressives Congress (APC) should allow their performance in office to speak, rather than resort to violence, “a trait they exhibited during the general election.”
