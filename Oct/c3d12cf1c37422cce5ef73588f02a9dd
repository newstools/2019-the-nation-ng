THE Senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District, Oluremi Tinubu, on Monday said Nigeria “cannot afford to fail.” In a statement to mark the 59th independence anniversary, she said leaders have a responsibility to ensure that the country thrives. She felicitated with “the good people of Lagos Central Senatorial District, Lagos State and Nigerians all over the world on the commemoration..” The statement reads: “Prior to gaining independence from the colonialists 59 years ago, the nationalists and heroes of our independence envisaged political stability, sporadic economic growth, and peaceful coexistence of Nigeria’s many ethnic groups. “While things may not have always gone as planned, the incidents of the last few weeks point to one thing – Nigeria as a nation cannot afford to fail. This places on us the responsibility of ensuring that Nigeria thrives. “Nigeria, for us, is home, regardless of how good it is elsewhere. Thus, we must resist the temptation to emigrate to other countries in search of greener pastures. The grass is greener where you water and nurture it. “We must all get to work collectively towards a Nigeria that we are all proud of, and to ensure that the labours of our heroes past are not in vain. “As citizens, there is so much that we can do – obey laws, do the right thing even when no one is watching, refuse to be used to orchestrate disunity. “We must continue to support the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari in the quest to salvage our nation from economic decay, insecurity and high level of corruption which has eaten deep into the fabric of the nation. “I am hopeful that if we continue to do our best, the Nigeria of our dreams, where justice, equity and peace prevail, will become a reality. “Once again, I congratulate you all and wish you Happy Independence Celebrations.”
