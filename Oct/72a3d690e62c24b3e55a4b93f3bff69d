 The Nigerian youngsters seeking a record six FIFA U-17 World Cup title at the weekend decimated Hungary 4-2 in a match that had the trappings of a cup final when they grabbed three goals in six minutes late into the game to upturn the Europeans who were coasting home to a win following a 2-1 lead at half time. Saturday’s win shot Nigeria on top of their section but only on goal difference after Ecuador handed a 2-1 defeat to Australia in the other Group B match of the day, consequently tomorrow’s match would be a titanic  top-of- the-drawer battle. A win against Ecuador would automatically take Nigeria to the Round of 16 and Garba has hinted   there won’t be margins for errors as he prepares his wards for the game. “We are going to review and analyse the performance of the players against Hungary individually,” Garba, a two-time FIFA U-17 World Cup winner in 2007 and 2013 told NationSport. “Collectively, we will work on the grey arrears before the next game against Ecuador on Tuesday.” Meanwhile, Captain Samson Tijani who was named by FIFA as Man of the Match in the Golden Eaglets battling 4-2 win over Hungary, has now promised the team would be better against Ecuador. “I am really grateful to God. I also thank my teammates for putting more effort for us to equalise and win the game against Hungary,” said the exciting defensive midfielder, who scored twice in the win over Hungary. “I would like the fans in Nigeria to keep on supporting and encouraging us to do well in this tournament and I promise our fan that the Golden Eaglets would do well in this tournament,” he added. Nigeria top Group B ahead Ecuador on goals difference of +2 after both recorded three points each on their opening games and Tuesday’s match at Estadio Olympico in Goiania will again kick off at 9pm in Nigeria.
