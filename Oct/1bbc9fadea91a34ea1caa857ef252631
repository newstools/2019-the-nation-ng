By Emeka Ugwuanyi Pacegate Limited, a subsidiary of Hana Group and manufacturer of steel drums, has  achieved 5000 steel drums daily production. Its Managing Director, Mr. Umesh Amarnani, stated this during the media tour of the firm’s manufacturing plant at Ilupeju Industrial Avenue, Lagos. According to him, the tour was to mark the first anniversary of the firm. Amarnani said the company is the first and only United Nations (UN) certified steel drum factory in the country. He said the UN approved packaging guarantees that the drums have been built, tested and certified to carry precious liquids or solids, which can either be hazardous or non-hazardous. The certification also confirms that the drums are environmentally friendly and with no leakages. Also, the certification is mandatory for the export of steel drums. Each steel drum has a capacity of 210 litres. It  produces various types of steel drums – open top and the closed top drums. The closed top drums are closed on the top while the open-top drums are open to allow access from the top for ease of application. The closed top steel drum is typically used for storing low viscosity fluids while open top drums are convenient for storing solids, powder and highly viscous fluids. He said: “At the moment, most independent lubricant blenders are using plastic drums, however, the global industry standard in the oil and gas sector is steel drums. This is because steel drums are more superior to plastic drums.”
