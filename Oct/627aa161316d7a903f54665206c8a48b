 THE wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has said that the girl-child is an asset to the nation and should be loved, respected and encouraged just like her male counterpart. Sanwo-Olu was speaking at the International Day of the Girl Child 2019 Summit organised by Heartminders Social Advancement Initiatives in conjunction with The United Nations Information Centre, held at Afe Babalola Hall, University of Lagos. She said that we must also acknowledge the fact that the existence of human life on earth is impossible without the equal participation of both women and men. They are equally responsible for the survival of human race on the earth. They are also liable for the development and growth of a nation. Sanwo-Olu who was represented by Mrs. Fatima Obanikoro, said, “Girls are more talented, obedience, hard-working and responsible for the family and their lives. Besides, girls are more caring and loving towards their parents. Above all, they give 100% in every work”. “A female child deserves a life where she is treated as equal to a boy. She should be respected, loved and given a chance to rule like their male counterpart,” she said.
