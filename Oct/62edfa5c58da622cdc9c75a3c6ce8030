By Justina Asishana – Minna Former Niger Governor, Dr. Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu, has called on the State Government to explain how it spent a $181 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank(IDB). According to Aliyu, the loan was meant for dualisation of the Minna-Bida road, adding that the money entered the Niger state bank account after he left office. Speaking at the flag-off and presentation of flags to 25 chairmanship candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP for the November 30, 2019, local government election in Niger state, Aliyu wondered why the government did not utilise the money for the purpose it was meant for. He lamented the negligence of the government has led to the collapse of the road. “I went to Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to seek an interest-free loan to dualize the Minna-Bida road, but by the time the Money came I have left office in 2015,” he stated. He urged the people to demand the government to give an account of the money and the purpose it was expended for. “I want you to ask the Government what they have done with the money. They need to explain and give account to the people. The former Governor then solicited votes for PDP candidates during the local government election, adding that bringing in PDP at the local level would give the people the opportunity to enjoy the dividends of democracy. Former Kano Governor, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, lamented the declining state of the Suleja- Minna road. He declared adding that the government needs to sit up to its responsibility of providing good social amenities to the people. A large crowd of PDP faithful from the 25 local government areas of Niger state attended the rally.
