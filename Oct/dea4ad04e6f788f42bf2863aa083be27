Golden Eaglets’ duo of defender Usman Mohammed and striker  Akinkunmi Amoo have both revealed  how  Nigeria bounced back from an imminent defeat to edged out Ecuador 3-2  in their second game at the FIFA U-117 World Cup Brazil 2019. Despite coming from behind in their two group matches to berth into  the Round of 16 of the lads said  they  weren’t ready  to slow down as they are yearning for another win in tomorrow’s tie against Australia. Defender Usman Mohamed who netted a goal in their first game against Hungary admitted that the South American side made the tie difficult for them but said: “We played very well against the Ecuadorians because we don’t want to go home even when they were leading 2-1 and it remained 10minutes. We raised our game and that is the reason why we came out victorious.” For striker Akinkunmi Amoo, the Ecuador side nearly scuttled their dream especially in the first half. But Amoo commended his teammate – Ibrahim Said who netted the three goals in Nigeria’s 3-2 win. “When the game remained 10minutes, we never gave up and we also realized that our opponents were tired and they were not playing together again. So we put in more efforts and even the equalizer scored by Ibrahim came as a surprise because we cannot imagine him scoring from a long distance,” Amoo said. He however, lauded the Ecuadorians for their composure throughout the encounter, while admitting that the team is poised to cuddle the trophy for the sixth time.
