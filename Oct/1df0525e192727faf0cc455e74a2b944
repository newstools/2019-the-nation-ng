BENCHWARMERS in clubs will not be welcomed when coach Gernot Rohr will unveil Super Eagles squad  for next month’s  2021 AFCON qualifiers  against Benin Republic  and  Lesotho This much was stated by Super Eagles’  media officer Toyin Ibitoye even as he hinted  that the list might not be a great  departure  from the squad that played against Ukraine and Brazil in international friendly. “We are expecting to have active players in the team because we cannot afford to experiment now as there is no time again; we are hoping that none of the players will have injury,”  explained  the frontline TV sport journalist.“I must also let you know that there would not be any change from the squad that played against Brazil and Ukraine. “With less than two weeks to the encounter, the list will soon be released to the media. But don’t expect any surprise in the team,” he added. The Super Eagles are  slated for  two AFCON qualifying matches against Benin Republic  at home on November 13 and  away to Lesotho  in Maseru on November 19.
