Morakinyo Abodunrin  SUPER Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze believes the big match between Nigeria and Brazil is more than friendly tie with combatants on both sides readying themselves for the prestige game. The October 13th  duel slated for Singapore National Stadium would be the first real contest between  the two sides since Brazil beat  Nigeria 3-0  in an international  friendly at the then newly-constructed  Abuja National Stadium (now known as M.K.O Abiola Stadium) in 2003. Incidentally, Chukwueze was in Nigeria’s national U-17 team that drubbed the South Americans 3-0 five years ago at the Estadio Sausalito Vina Del Mar on their way to winning a record fifth global cadet title in Chile. “That’s a big game (between Nigeria and Brazil) to look forward to in Singapore and I think it’s going to be a tough match,” the 20-year-old Chukwueze said in an interview with NationSport. Though  the five-time World Cup champions were run-away  winner with a comprehensive 4-0 defeat of Japan during  their last visit to Singapore five years ago, Chukwueze said it would be a close contest  between the Selecao and Super Eagles. “I don’t know how it’s going to be but I’m confident we are going to make our country proud because everybody is going to look up to this game,” explained Chukwueze who was recently named in the 40-man list of nominees for the 2019 Golden Boy Award. “It’s going to be a tough game but everybody would see what we are made of when we play against Brazil. I believe this set of Super Eagles is very good; it’s not just that we are good but we are committed. “We have the fighting spirit to do everything possible to remain one of the best teams in the world and I think we are going to do well against Brazil,” added the 2018 Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Young Player of the Year.
