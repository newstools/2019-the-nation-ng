 Nigeria born English player Jonathan Chiedozie Obika is eager to score goals for St Mirren admitting that it is his responsibility to do so with a view to taking the club to greater heights. The 29 year old is yet to get off the mark following his summer move from Oxford in August this year. Obika is however not the only one having migraine over goal drought as the Saints have only scored three goals in seven Scottish Premiership games. The Jim Goodwin tutored side face Motherwell away on Saturday. “You have to get goals and deliver, you have to help the team,” said Obika who came off the bench during last weekend’s goalless draw against Hearts. “You know your role in the team and getting goals is one of the main ones for us. “I feel I have settled in pretty well, I feel relaxed there. And in terms of the league, you want to put your best foot forward in terms of goals and getting results, so those are the things I want to do. “I believe the goals are coming. We have got a solid base and we know what type of chances are coming and we just have to be ready to take them and deliver on the day” he enthused Only Kyle Magennis, Tony Andreu and Ilkay Durmus have found the net for Saints recently. Obika made combined 140 appearances for Swindon Town and Oxford United scoring 31 goals before joining St Mirren went on loan a record 11 times in the course of his career.
