From Jamiu Abiodun Stakeholders in the information and communication technology (ICT) circuit are advocating a beneficial and decent use of the social media to address the menace of fake news, hate speech, advance fee fraud and other forms of cybercrimes. They made the plea at the fourth annual Nigerian Social Media Summit (NSMS), themed: ‘Social media as a tool for participatory governance’. The summit sponsored by Centre for Information Technology Advancement and Development (CITAD) – a civil society organisation, had in attendance ICT experts, youth bodies, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), journalists and human rights activists. Keynote speaker and founder of Image Merchant Promotions Limited (IMPR) Alhaji Yushau Shuaib, urged youths to exploit ICT potentials to advance socio-economic development “We need to understand how to use the social media appropriately, both economically and also for advocacy in better governance,” he began. Shuaib, a Public Relations expert, added that while the use of social media for governance has become increasingly important, there is need to also adhere to ethics in order to check the spate of hate speech and fake news. Speaker of the Nigerian Youth Parliament (NYP), Mubarak Mijinyawa, and the National Youth Council of Nigeria President, Bello Shagari, called on youths to participate in democratic governance and decision-making through the social media. The Creative Director of Nigerian Technology Market, Olanrewaju Oyedeji, said the need to stimulate relevant discussions through the social media birthed the summit, adding that NSMS has become a household name which will continue to set agenda for the effective use of various social media platforms. The representative of FCT Police Commissioner, Mr Zakani Shekmaga, assured participants of the support of the police in their various activities. Chairman of the event and CITAD Executive Director YZ Yau, who earlier declared the event opened, underscored the need to build more impacts around the social media.
