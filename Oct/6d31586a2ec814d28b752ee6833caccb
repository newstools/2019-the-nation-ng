VICTIMS of a fire incident that occurred on April 6 at Shonola Street Ogba have received donations from the Chairman of Ojodu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State, Mr Julius Oloro. Several shops were razed with goods worth millions of naira lost to the inferno. The cheques were presented to the victims at the council secretariat. The council boss said the paramount duty of any government, irrespective of the tier, is to ensure the safety of life and property of her citizens. He said the cheque is a remedial action to ensure that the people’s means of livelihood are restored. Oloro urged the beneficiaries to put the palliative fund to good use and prayed that such incidents will not recur. The council boss promised to follow up on the council’s official letter to the Lagos State Government on the matter of compensation to victims of the fire incidents.
