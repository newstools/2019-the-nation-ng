By Kelvin Osa Okunbor  Airport users across the country have been reminded of the need to make judicious use of facilities at airport terminals with a view to preserving them The Director of Airport Operations of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Capt Muktar Yusuf Muye who gave this charge at the Malam Aminu International Airport, Kano MAKIA while fielding questions from newsmen said passengers have a great role to play in order to ensure durability of facilities at airports by handling them with care. Muye noted that some passengers were not bothered with manner in which they handle public facilities urging them to see airport facilities as their own when handling them. “Airport users have a very great role to play in ensuring the durability of our facilities, they should handle them like their personal property and by so doing, facilities will last longer” Muye acknowledges various infrastructural challenges facing FAAN but explained that the organisation was gradually addressing them as most of the airports were built over forty years noting that the airport in Kano was not built to accommodate the current traffic being experienced today. According to the FAAN director of airport operations, the new terminals under construction across the country when completed will address so many problems being encountered by passengers adding that there will be more space for passengers facilitation and comfort. Meanwhile, regional/ airport manager, Malam Aminu Kano International Airport, Alhaji Sabo Giade has assured passengers making use of the oldest airport in Africa (Kano) of a world-class terminal as soon as the terminal building was commissioned. Giade told journalists that the new terminal will provide space for passenger facilitation as the current terminal was overstretched especially at the international terminal as almost all the aircraft arrive at the same time. He explained that the present international terminal building will be converted to domestic use as soon as the new international terminal was opened.
