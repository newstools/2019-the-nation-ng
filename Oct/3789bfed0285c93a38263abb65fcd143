President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to re-appoint Ibrahim Magu for another four-year term as chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC).
An anti-corruption group, Nigerians Against Corruption, made this call in a statement made available to our correspondent. The Coordinator of NAC, Abdulmalik Adamu, said Magu deserved another four-year term following the arrest of high profile graft perpetrators and cyber-crime operators across the country. According to him: “Mr President, we have all seen the works of Ibrahim Magu at EFCC – the high profile arrest and the constant arrest of yahoo-yahoo boys who are trying to give Nigeria a bad name.
“Unlike in the past were EFCC engages in media trial, the agency under Magu has shifted from that era to real trial and arrest. This is a clear example that Magu means business. “Take a look at the agency’s collaborative efforts with the FBI and the recovery of a large number of exotic cars as well as properties suspected to have been acquired through the proceeds of crime. “The commission has also recovered several millions traced to various commercial banks. Only a dedicated chairman like Magu can achieve these feats despite the fact that corruption is fighting back. Even politicians of the ruling party are not left out in the fight against corruption.” Adamu added that if Buhari is serious about anti-corruption war, Magu should be re-appointed to finish what he had started. “Bringing in a fresh hand will not help the fight against corruption because he will spend the next four years learning on the job,” he stressed.
