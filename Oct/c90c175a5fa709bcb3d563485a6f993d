Nigeria men’s handball team will be hoping for a World Cup ticket as it begin camping in Lagos next month for the  forthcoming Africa Handball Nations Cup to be hosted by Tunisia between January 16  and 30 2020. Nigeria is group alongside Angola, Gabon, and Libya in the group phase of the competition. While Angola might pose the biggest threat to Nigeria’s ambition of moving out of the group, Technical Director of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), Ferdinand Emeana said the Gabonese and Libyans cannot be written off. At the last edition in Gabon, the Nigeria  finished last but Emeana told NationSport that the team can perform better if it gets adequate support from the Ministry of Sports. He also stated that most of the players have been active and ready for the championship. He said:  “I wouldn’t say whether the group is cheap or tough. Ours is to give the country a good representation and that means picking a World Cup and Olympics ticket. It’s not going to be easy but the players are determined and the board is determined. What I request is the support of the government. We need to prepare well to get a good result.” he noted.
