was brought to Mallam camp by my parents when they found me and I have been living in the Mallam camp over five years ago. “I was regularly having sex with some of the Mallam children and other relatives, not less than five people that were engaged to supervise us in the camp and I remembered that I have had pregnancy in three
different times which they always gave me some medicines to use for the pregnancy not to stay.” Another inmate, Tope Collins Owonifaari, said that unknown persons picked up in Lagos and eventually he found himself in the centre’s unhygienic environment where all were indiscriminately lumped together.
