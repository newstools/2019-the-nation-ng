Wolverhampton Wanderers shared the spoils for the sixth time in 10 Premier League games as Jonny equalised in the second half to earn them a 1-1 draw at Newcastle United on Sunday. A dull first half came alive when Jamaal Lascelles met a cross from Federico Fernandez with a thumping header to put the hosts ahead in the 37th minute.
