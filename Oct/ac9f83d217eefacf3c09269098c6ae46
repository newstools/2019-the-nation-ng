 SUPER Eagles German coach Gernot Rohr said Nigeria  is too big to miss out of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Football Tournament(OFT)  hence he would be heading straight to Cairo  to help the national Under-23 team squarely under his assistant, Imama Amapakabo. Amapakabo has been under intense pressure lately after  his  Home-based Super Eagles Team B were edged out  of qualification for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) by  Togo; and the former international goalkeeper seemingly  need all the support  to earn Nigeria one of the continental tickets to Tokyo 2020. “I’m going to Egypt first to assist the U-23,” Rohr told NationSport  from France. The 2019 U-23 AFCON  will be held in Egypt between 8-22 November. Nigeria have been handed a tough preliminary group section  along with West African rivals Cote d’Ivoire  as well as Zambia and South Africa and the Olympic Eagles will start their campaign on 9th November  at Al Salam Stadium in Cairo against  Cote d’Ivoire to be followed with  the games against Zambia on 12th November  and South Africa on 15th November. Pressed about what  his level of involvement would be  with the Olympic Eagles, the vastly-experienced former Bayern Munich defender  said the buck will stop at  Amapakabo’s desk as the substantive coach , adding  his planned trio to Cairo for the championship offers him further opportunity at watching closely youngsters who might be called up  for the Super eagles in the nearest future. He said pointedly:“ team selection is Imama. But qualification for Olympics is very important  and some players could also be interesting for my team. But I will try to help Imama.” Meanwhile, Rohr has equally reveled that players to prosecute the forthcoming 2021 AFCON qualifying matches against Benin and Lesotho would be unveiled ‘very soon.’
