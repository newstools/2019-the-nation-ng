From Fasilat Oluwuyi Students’ of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta, have embarked on a road walk tagged:  ‘MAPOLY is back with a bang”. The programme, aimed at creating more awareness about the institution, started off from the school premises and moved round the major areas in Abeokuta, with participants distributing flyers to residents. Students Union (SU) President Samson Omoniyi told CAMPUSLIFE that the campaign was organised to rebrand as well as correct certain misconceptions about the insitution. Omoniyi said there was the need to educate the public that the planned relocation of the institution from Ojere to Ipokia under the immediate past administration was no longer feasible. He said: “We need to clear certain impressions some people have that MAPOLY has been moved to another location. We need to reassure such people that aside the fact that that is no longer possible, MAPOLY is really back and better. “We need to also let people know that MAPOLY maintains a good image. Some parents have misconceptions about MAPOLY, but as students, we will not allow any rumour to affect our fate. “We need to rebrand the image of MAPOLY so as to further stimulate interest for potential admission-seekers for 2019/2020 admission process. Also, the SU Public Relations Officer Johson Idowu, described the walk as the contribution by SU to the development of the institution. He lauded the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, who stopped the relocation. “I am proud to say it anywhere that I’m a product of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic. This is because of the calibre of faculty staff and the status of the institution among its contemporaries. ‘’On our part, we believe our own way of contributing to the development of this institution is to sensitise the public to acknowledge that we are back to full academic activities.”
