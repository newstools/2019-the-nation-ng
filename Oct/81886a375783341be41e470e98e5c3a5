Super Eagles forward, Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis was the cynosure of all eyes at the Bernabeu on Tuesday as he scored a first half brace against Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League but the Belgian side couldn’t hold to their lead. Real Madrid were battered by Paris Saint-Germain in the opening match of their Champions’ League group and their game at home against Club Brugge was expected to set them back on course in the competition, but Zinedine Zidane’s side suffered a nightmare start. Dennis put his side ahead after just nine minutes with a goal that was initially ruled out for offside, before VAR came to their rescue, and doubled the lead with a deft chip over Thibaut Courtois on 40 minutes. Ramos headed the Spanish side back into the game after 55 minutes despite the fact he’d initially looked offside from the cross, but VAR confirmed it was indeed a goal. Ruud Vormer was sent off after 84 minutes for a second bookable offence and Casemiro made it 2-2 from the resulting free kick. Dennis’ first goal for Club Brugge is the fastest they have ever scored in a Champions League game (8 minutes, 9 seconds) and the 23-year-old became the third Nigerian to score against Real Madrid in the competition, after James Obiorah and Ayila Yussuf. Compatriot David Okereke was not listed for the Belgian side despite scoring a brace last weekend and was replaced in the team by South African international, Percy Tau.
