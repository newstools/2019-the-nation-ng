Directors and Chief Road Traffic Officers across the federation have been urged to take serious issues of road worthiness in order to ensure the safety of lives and property on the roads. Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation Dr Frederic Oladeinde gave the charge on Wednesday, while declaring open the national conference of Directors/Chief Road Traffic Officers of the Federation, hosted by the state. According to him, the Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIS) as critical agency in road safety and accident prevention must be alive to their responsibility of ensuring that all vehicles on the roads are worthy of being put on the road. He asked them to come up with strategies aimed at standardizing practice aimed at curbing accidents and ensuring consistency and prompt service delivery. Addressing the theme of the conference: Employing Technology to Enhance Compliance and Safety on our Roads, Oladeinde said Lagos State has continued to play pivotal roles in deploying technology on the roads, a development which has mitigated risks, increased the rate of voluntary compliance which has reduced hazards to the barest minimum on the roads. He listed among other technological innovations deployed by the government to include Lagos State Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service Centre, (LACVIS), which has reduced to the barest incidences of human error on road worthiness of vehicle, and the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), which randomly captures number plate and verify all its data from a synchronised data, which has been discovered to be suitable for traffic law enforcement. The state according to him, has also acquired for the VIS an AutoVIN machine, for forensic test in order to enhance its capacity to carry out pre-registration inspection activity in line with global best practices and in compliance with section 12 of the state’s road traffic law 2012. Oladeinde said the government has continued to upgrade the drivers’ license from manual testing to an e-testing format, which is meant to make it easy for Lagosians to undergo computerised tests. He said: ”For sanity, safety, security and standards to prevail on the roads, every road user must realise that road safety is a collective responsibility because road is a shared asset by all and sundry.”
