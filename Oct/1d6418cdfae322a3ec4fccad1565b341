 Super Falcons of Nigeria Monday at the Agege Township Stadium failed in their bid to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The Assisat Oshoala captained side were held to a 1-1 draw by their Ivorian counterparts in front of Nigerian fans who had trooped out in their numbers to cheer the team to victory. The care-taker coach Christopher  Danjuma tutored side had earlier played out a goalless draw in Abidjan. Many had predicted that the Falcons would rise to the occasion at home especially riding on the back of home support to carry the day, but the team failed to fly even as the whereabouts of Chief Coach Thomas Dernneby remains unknown. The two-legged tie thus ended in a 1-1 aggregate as the Ivorian girls progress to the fourth round of the qualifiers. The Ivorians from all indications came determined to double the effort they had made holding Falcons at home.  The visitors shot into the lead in the 12th minute thanks to Nina Kapho in the 12th minute. Falcons’ captain Assisat Oshoala however leveled up in the 34th minute but that was the much the Falcons could offer, as efforts made to better the result hit the rocks.
