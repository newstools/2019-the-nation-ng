 For the first time, since he was relieved of his duties and his agency scrapped, former Chairman of the Special Presidential Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIP), Okoi Obono-Obla spoke on Saturday about his ordeal. Obono-Obla, who said he executed his brief to the best of is ability, stated that those behind his ordeal were bent on rubbishing him before the Nigerian public. He wondered why those behind his ordeal were still after him having taken his job and declared him wanted for doing nothing wrong. Obono-Obla noted that those who looted the nation’s treasury and crippled its economy are walking the streets free. His positions are contained in a message he posted on his facebook page on Saturday evening. He said: “What are these people after me? They took their job away, yet they are not done. “They smeared me in the media, they framed me. They lied against me. They declared me wanted. What offence have I committed? “Even those, who have stolen billions or contributed to the wrecking of the national economy are not treated with such indignity. Those who have corruptly enriched themselves. “They just want to humiliate me. They want to break me. They want to demonise me  before Nigerians. “I am a true patriot of Nigeria. I did my Job with utmost dedication, dignity , integrity and commitment. “God and history shall always vindicate the just. Nelson Mandela was persecuted, prosecuted, dehumanized and imprisoned for 27 years, but he became a world icon.”
