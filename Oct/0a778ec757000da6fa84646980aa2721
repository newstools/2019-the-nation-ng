Chief Executive Officer, Stanbic IBTC Nominees Limited Mr Akeem Oyewale has stressed the need for students to acquire digital skills for future employment. Oyewale said the 21st century graduate must accept the reality that technology will become a major determinant in future employment, with newer jobs requiring higher skill set. Oyewole spoke during the sixth edition of the career expo organised by the Management Student Association of the University of Lagos. He said: “Students have to be ready for the next kind of jobs that will be available. There are some jobs that human beings will be told that they don’t need to apply for because we are in the digital age. Students need to be aware of artificial intelligence, data analytics, and robotics. These are areas they need to be conscious of. He continued: “It doesn’t matter whether you are a science graduate, computer science graduate, or a management science graduate, it is important that you know that the reality is that this is where the future is going and you have to be ready.” The Director of Tax and Regulatory of ServicePricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC), Mr Chijioke Uwaegbute, advised students who want to be relevant in the changing economic landscape to be willing to learn and adapt to novel ideas.
