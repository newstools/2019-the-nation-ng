Music superstar Davido has blasted activist and social commentator Kayode Ogundamisi on Twitter over the video showing the arrest of two ladies, Susan and Helen, who recently claimed Davido got one of them pregnant. In a video, which went viral on social media, the two ladies were seen handcuffed to each other and trying to hide their faces as Davido’s hypeman, Spesh, threatened to slap one of them and listed the allegations against the ladies. Ogundamisi criticised Davido for the way he and his men paraded the ladies. He quoted a post showing the video with a sarcastic comment in which he wondered how things would have gone down in Osun state, had Davido’s uncle, Isiaka Adeleke emerged governor. He said: “Imagine @iam_Davido as first Cousin in @StateofOsun with his Uncle @IsiakaAdeleke1 as Governor. And @MBuhari is meant to be the tyrant o!” In a swift reaction, Davido said Ogundamisi was pained that someone half his age is greater than he will ever be. He added that the whole life earnings of Ogundamisi is not up to 30 per cent of his show money. He said: “It pains you that someone half your age that you can give birth too is Greater than you will ever be … U are a loser, a disappointment…… You are useless! Now keep my family name out of your mouth! Your whole life earnings no reach 30 percent of my show money and it hurts I know.”  It pains you that someone half ur age that you can give birth too is Greater than you will ever be … U are a loser , a disappointment…… ur are useless !
