Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State gave us a piece of his childhood, and how he came to bear the name Sule. That was biography some in the Nigerian culture can identify with, especially when the person who adopts you becomes a benevolent father figure. He bore Sule, as he narrates, when he was handed to his uncle Miskoom Nanbiet, by his biological father. He made this remark at his uncle’s funeral. “When my uncle asked my father to release me to him, my father told my uncle that I had become his son. Because of the tradition of love and unity, I bore my uncle’s name, Sule, when he enrolled me in school.” When he was done with primary school, he was told to bear Bako Lalong as the first son of his father. He swore affidavit to this. Useni and his PDP would not accept the shellacking at the polls. They lost in substance. They want to win through the back door. They want to undermine the identity of the person who won and by that undermine the authenticity of democratic elections.
