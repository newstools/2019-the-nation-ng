Mrs. Cecilia Bolaji Dada, pointed out that the objective of the empowerment programme is to train women, girls and men alike in various skills and vocations for the purpose of economic empowerment and lifting their status from the state of dependency to self-reliance. “There is dearth of ‘white collar’ jobs, it is in realisation of this economic reality that the Lagos State government established 17 functional skills acquisition centres around the state,” she said. “The present administration under the able leadership of Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has taken women empowerment as one of its focal policies in order to mitigate the effects of poverty prevalent amongst women, we realise that when women are economically empowered, there is less tension in the home front and obvious reduction in domestic violence,” she said.
