By Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa Niger Delta ex-militants have called on the Senate to confirm persons nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari to serve on the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The ex-agitators said the Senate should not waste time in confirming the commission’s Chairman and Managing Director designates, Dr. Pius Odubu, and Mr. Bernard Okumagba; Executive Director, Finance and Administartion, Maxwell Oko; and Executive Director, Project, Otobong Ndem, among others. The ex-militants, in a statement by their National Coordinator, Tonye Bobo, popularly known as Sir T and Secretary, Karo Edor, aka OBJ, after an enlarged meeting in Yenagoa, further appraised the activities of the NDDC in the region. They commended President Buhari for his sincerity in the rapid development of the region and urged all the stakeholders to sheathe their words for the general interest of the Niger Delta. The former creek warlords said those nominated by the President were competent, credible and deserving to discharge their responsibilities in the commission. They said: “We also call on all stakeholders to support the constitution of the new NDDC board.We throw our weight behind the forensic probe of NDDC, since its inception to date. “Those, who were at the helms of affairs only siphon money and award contracts of the commission to their cronies and political juggernauts without any meaningful development to show for. “We also lament the deplorable state of roads across the nation. Nigerians can no longer move from one part of the country to another and we urge the Federal and state governments to work in synergy to fix the roads to save the nation”. END.
