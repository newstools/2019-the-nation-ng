 Undefeated WBA Continental cruiser-weight champion, Lawrence ‘The Sauce’ Okolie knocked out Belgium’s Yves Ngabu at The O2 Arena in London to add Ngabu’ European belt to his title collection. The unbeaten 26-year-old continued his rise towards a world title fight as he halted the previously unbeaten Ngabu with a ferocious flurry of punches in the seventh round. After a slow first round, Okolie used his long reach in the second round, unleashing a flurry late in the round that saw several right hands successfully land on Ngabu. Ngabu came out of strong in round five with intent, applying pressure and forcing himself on Okolie with a bloodied nose. A left hook got Okolie’s attention, who pushed him away and immediately landed a right. By the seventh, Okolie proved he was the stronger fighter with a more clean right hand that ended Ngabu’s night, and now, bigger opportunities are on his horizon. “I felt that it was going to be hard because he was short and stocky,” said Okolie. “I picked it up in the last half of the fight, and let it go. If I hit any cruiserweight in the chin, he’s going to go. I’m progressing, learning all the time, have the physical attributes and I’m ready for a world title fight.”
