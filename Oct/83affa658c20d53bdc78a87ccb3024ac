Rotary International District 9110 has launched a campaign against polio in Lagos and Ogun states, which fall within the district’s jurisdiction. Speaking at a forum organised by Rotary Club of Onigbogbo at Ikeja GRA, Lagos, Mr Jelili Efeni of its Health and Environment Committee, said in the past one year, Nigeria had been taken out of the list of the countries, which included India and Afghanistan, where polio was prevalent. He attributed the feat to the efforts by Rotary and the government to wipe out the disease, which he said has run into millions of naira. He said because some cases of the disease were noticed in the North, Nigeria could not be declared polio-free, adding that Nigeria had been given till next year to be declared free. Efeni said immunisation of children would continue until the goal is attained. He said all hands must be on deck to ensure the programme’s success. According to him, a lot of funds had been pumped into the eradication of the disease. The club’s President James Ajayi said Rotary is committed to the promotion of health, with polio tops of its agenda. He said the club’s members had been tasking themselves to raise enough cash to fight the disease.
