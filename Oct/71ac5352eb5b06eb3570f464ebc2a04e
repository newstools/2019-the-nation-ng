Christian Pulisic scored a hat-trick to announce his arrival in English football in sensational style as Chelsea beat Burnley for a seventh consecutive win in all competitions. The 21-year-old American winger scored a ‘perfect’ hat-trick with a left foot, right foot and headed effort. He was the difference in an even first half, first of all winning the ball on the halfway line before running all the way and slotting home. His second was also a break from midfield after Willian won possession. Burnley were in the game until that stage but Chelsea ran away with it in the second half. Pulisic headed in from Mason Mount’s cross for his first career treble, before Willian blasted home a fourth moments later. Jay Rodriguez’s long-range strike and Dwight McNeil’s deflected effort brought huge roars from the Turf Moor faithful but they had left their comeback far too late. BBCSports
