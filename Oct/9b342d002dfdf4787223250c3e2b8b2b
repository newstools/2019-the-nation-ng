The African Development Bank (AfDB) has said it will partner with the Afe Bablola University Multi-system Hospital (ABUMH) to offer medical services to its staff across the continent. The AfDB said the proposed partnership was predicated on the need to explore the opportunities inherent in the world class supersonic 400-bed teaching hospital. The bank applauded the founder of the instituiton, Chief Afe Babalola, for the huge investment he has made in the medical facility, saying the hospital had carved a niche for itself on the global map of world class health center. Speaking with journalists at ABUAD during an assessment tour of the medical facility, the AfDB Regional Medical Doctor, Nigeria Country Department, Dr. Augustine Uhunwangho, who led two other members of the delegation, said the multi-system hospital had met every criterion of excellence in healthcare delivery. Uhunwangho said the Afe Babalola Teaching Hospital had been making waves across the African continent, adding that getting patronage from the bank would improve its service delivery system. “It is the policy of the AFDB to ensure the members of our staff are medically fit. It was thought wise to make objective assessment of this medical facility to recommend it to the insurance company in charge of healthcare services to our staff, so that it can be enrolled as one of those facilities that can render health care services to our staff,” he said. The founder of the university, Chief Afe Babalola (SAN), applauded AfDB for supporting the university in terms of recognition and provision of financial support.
