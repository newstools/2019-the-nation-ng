THE Director-General, Wada/Aro Governorship Campaign Organisation, Mr. Tajudeen Yusuf, has appealed to politicians in Kogi State to put the progress and development of the state and its people above other considerations in their actions, activities and utterances, ahead of the November 16 governorship election. He urged politicians to eschew bickering, personality attacks and misinformation. He was reacting to comments credited to Sen. Smart Adeyemi, the Director-General of the All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) governorship candidate, Governor Yahaya Bello, in a statement in Abuja. Yusuf said the APC campaign team may have been jolted by the huge success of the formal inauguration of the PDP governorship campaign committees, which took place in Lokoja. “For both of us and all those involved in marketing our  candidates and political parties, I appeal that we all put the progress and development of Kogi State and its people above other considerations  in our actions, activities and utterances,” he said in the statement.
