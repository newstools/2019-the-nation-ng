IN Makurdi, the Benue State capital, police shot teargas to disperse protesting Okada riders, arrested many of them and took their motorcycles to police station. The commercial motorcyclists  took to major streets of the capital city to protest against what they called the high cost of registration and licensing of motorcycles in the  state. In an attempt to stop the cyclists from protesting, police fired teargas at them. Chairman of Benue Motorcyclists  Association (BEMOA) Comrade Matthew Nyiutsa told The Nation that efforts were being made to resolve the crisis, saying they were given a grace period to pay by instalments to reduce the burden on members. Comrade Nyiutsa described the registration and licensing of motorcycles as a national policy which his members must comply with but pleaded for more time. Police Spokesperson Kate Anene told The Nation that every vehicle on the road must obtained a licence and registration including motor cycles. She said the grace period is over and the commercial motorcycle riders must comply. Some okada riders who spoke to The Nation said the registration fee is top high .
