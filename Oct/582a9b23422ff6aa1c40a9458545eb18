With his brace in Club Brugge’s 2-2 draw against Real Madrid, Emmanuel Dennis has become the third Nigerian to score against the Spaniards in the UEFA Champions League. Only Yusuf Ayila and James Obiorah had found the next against Los Blancos in the tournament’s history. Furthermore, his first strike was the earliest goal scored by the Belgians in Champions League history. The Blue-Black got off to the best possible start at Santiago Bernabeu, as Dennis gave the visitors a shock lead after nine minutes despite making a mess of Percy Tau’s cross. He doubled his side’s lead six minutes before the half-time break after Luka Modric’s careless pass sent the youngster through on goal, before beating Thibaut Courtois in goal. Sergio Ramos and Casemiro clawed a point back for Zinedine Zidane’s men, but it was the Nigerian who shone the brightest in Madrid.  Goal.Com
