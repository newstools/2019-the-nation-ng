 SOME members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday indicated interests in the All Progressives Congress (APC) when David Lyon, the APC governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, campaigned in Sagbama Local Government. Lyon said APC had convinced the politicians who decamped that the people were tired of PDP style of administration and needed a positive change. The APC standard-bearer noted that Bayelsans lacked good road network, health facilities, schools and proper drainage. He said when voted into power, the APC administration would bring development, security and investors to the state. “Apart from these, youth empowerment schemes will also be introduced, while older people and the vulnerable will be carried along,” Lyon said. The APC Campaign Coordinator for Sagbama, Mr. Micheal Kurlorkor, said that the crowds were the indigenes of the area. In a welcome address, Bayelsa APC Chairman Jothan Amos promised the defectors of all- inclusiveness during and after the election. The former acting governor and ex-speaker of the House of Assembly, Mr. Nestor Binabo, said that Sagbama people were ready to support the APC candidate. He described Lyon as the chosen one to take Bayelsa to the next level.
