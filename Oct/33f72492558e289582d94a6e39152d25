 Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Monday inaugurated Jaro Industries’ N43billion corrugated carton factory at OPIC’s New Makun Industrial City on the Lagos Ibadan Expressway. The company is a subsidiary of Deekay Group. Abiodun inaugurated the factory alongside Deekay Group and Jaro Industries’ CEO/Managing Director, Mr. Kavine Vaswani. The governor, who was represented by OPIC’s Managing Director, Mrs. Yemi Adesoye, said it would enhance the packaging industry in Nigeria. “We are indeed very pleased to have you plant your factory in Ogun State. It shows we are doing certain things right, which have attracted you to our state. As a government, we will ensure that we give you all the necessary support you require for a smooth operation,” he added. Vaswani explained that the company employed about 250 workers directly and 350 contractual workers, adding that the employment level would increase to about 800 when the efficiency rate of the company built up. “We believe we will go a long way in reducing the unemployment rate not just in the state but in the country”, he added. Director-General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Segun Ajayi Kadir, while commending the management of Jaro Industries, said the factory would increase the manufacturing sector’s contributions to GDP. He called on the Federal Government to continue to partner with the private sector to grow the economy
