For the want of a perfect description, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila is a misunderstood man. He is a dogged and resilient fighter, who is hell bent on achieving his tall dreams. The Speaker of the 9th National Assembly is synonymous with grace. The reason is not far-fetched. He is one of the few who have witnessed the goodness of the creator in their lives. Achieving his long -time dream as the Speaker is a clear indication that anything can be achieved with hard work, loyalty and consistency. Naysayers must have recoiled into their cocoon as elections at the Green Chambers are over and the House under his leadership has been fully involved in the business of law making. Those who have enjoyed a close rapport with Gbajabimila will attest to the fact that there is one thing you canâ€™t take away from him; his heart of kindness and love for the downtrodden. Despite his position as the 4th man in the country, he is not power drunk. Yet, he sees wealth, affluence and position as God- given which must be used for the uplift of humanity. The trained lawyer has demonstrated his humane side quite often most especially in 2017, when he gifted a physically challenged lawyer, Kamarudeen Idowu a brand new car for graduating from Law school. When he emerged Speaker, he further appointed him as one of his aides at the Green Chamber. The latest of his philanthropic deeds was when he visited Gidan Baki IDP camp, Kastina where he saw a 3-month old baby Halimatu Abdulai, who needed an urgent cleft plastic surgery. The Speaker, in his magnanimous nature, offered to sponsor the surgery in Abuja. A close source disclose little Halimatu has undergone a four- hour surgery at the Royal Specialist Hospital, Abuja where she is recuperating.
