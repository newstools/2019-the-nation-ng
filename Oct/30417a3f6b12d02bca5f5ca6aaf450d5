 Which way for Nigeria-born England junior international Tammy Abraham?  Will the 21 year old play for the Three Lions under Coach Gareth Southgate or settle for Super Eagles under Coach Gernot Rohr? Thursday will be decision day for the Chelsea forward who has since netted seven goals for the Stamford Bridge landlords. Both countries have shown interest in having him commit to international future and several stakeholders have offered him useful advice on the pros and cons of choosing one of the countries. Gareth Southgate is set to play a double header in the Euro qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria respectively and there are indications that his final 23-man team will be announced on Thursday. There are equally insinuations in some quarters that Tammy might get a last minute call up. Should Tammy who is sure to feature in Chelsea’s Champions league against Lille today  feature in any of the qualifiers lined up for the Three Lions  next weekend, he would put paid to the unending debate over which country he will settle for. Only recently former Millwall and Wimbledon striker John Fashanu advised Tammy to learn from his mistake and join the Super Eagles where he stands a chance of playing many national matches that will help his international career.
