Augustine Ehikioya, Abuja  VICE President Yemi Osinbajo last night assured that the Buhari administration will honestly and transparently resolve the request by labour in the implementation of the new national minimum wage. Prof. Osinbajo told the leadership of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) led by its President Quadri Olaleye.that they should consider the President as someone committed to the welfare of workers. One of the first things he did when we came in was to give states a series of bailouts to help repay backlog of salaries.” The Vice President also noted according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Laolu Akande, that the Buhari administration refused to ignore the situation, and instead provided different facilities including Paris club refunds and budget support loans to provide immediate succour for States. He urged Labour to “find ways to work with a government that is honest and wants to work to resolve the issue transparently. “Let us give ourselves room to negotiate properly. The President wants an honest, open process, we will be transparent and honest about it. Labour leaders should give us the benefit of the doubt.” Dr. Ngige said the new national minimum wage was already being paid by the Federal Government, noting that arrears would also be settled.
