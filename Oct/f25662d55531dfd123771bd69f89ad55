Osagie OTABOR, Bénin TEACHERS in Edo State under the auspices of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), have endorsed Governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term in office. The teachers made their opinion known when they paid a thank you visit to the governor at the New Era College hall in Benin City. Chairman, Edo State chapter of the NUT, Comrade Pius Okhueleigbe, said their endorsement was because the achievements of Obaseki in three years surpassed achievements of his predecessors that spent eight years in office. Comrade Okhueleigbe noted that Obaseki is fixing infrastructures in schools, embarked on training and re-training of teachers as well as attended to their welfare. Okhueleigbe hailed Obaseki for approving nomenclature for primary school teachers to enable them rise beyond grade level 15. He listed areas where Obaseki has boosted teachers’ welfare and condition of service to include appointment of six teachers as Permanent Secretaries, prompt promotions, restoration of annual incremental credit amongst others. On his part, Obaseki said he was in talks with the World Bank to restructure junior secondary education. He faulted the current 6-3-3-4 system of education saying it made education mere schooling without learning. The governor stated that plans were on to revamp all junior secondary school and equip them with laboratory and workshops. Obaseki noted anybody who passed out of the revamped junior schools would have a skill. He also pledged to build a technical school in each of the 18 local government areas, adding that the technical schools would train workforce that would work in industries that are coming to the state.
