  THE police in Abuja on Monday arraigned a bus attendant, Chukwuemeka Christopher in an Abuja court, who allegedly stole two tyres from his employerâ€™s truck. Christopher, who works for Chisco Transport Company Abuja, was charged with two counts of conspiracy and theft. He pleaded not guilty before Karmo Grade I Area Court. The prosecutor, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, said that the matter was reported at the Utako police station on Oct. 17, by one Bako, who works in the same company. Ukagha alleged that Christopher was attached to a company truck travelling to Lagos to deliver some goods. She added that on the way, the vehicle developed a mechanical fault and Christopher offered to look after the vehicle and the goods while the driver went to fetch help.

The Judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety in like sum. Maiwada, ordered that the surety must reside within the court jurisdiction.
