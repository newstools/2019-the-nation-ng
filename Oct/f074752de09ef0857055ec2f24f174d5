Traders at Aroso Market in Mile 2 area of Lagos State have lamented over the estimated bills which Ikeja Electric (IE) has been giving them. They said the ‘crazy bills’ as such bills are commonly called, are affecting their businesses, adding that they have been receiving the bills since June. The leader of the market (Baba Oja), who is also the Babaloja General of Amuwo Odofin Local Government, Alhaji Abass Yusuf, who spoke at the weekend when he led the traders on a peaceful protest at the headquarters of IE in Alausa, Ikeja, appealed to the Lagos State Government to come to their aid by facilitating the supply of prepaid meters to them. He said the economic hardship experienced by the traders had chased a lot of them away from the market. Yusuf said they have sent letters to the company over their problems, to no avail. “We have written several letters to them. We wrote to their undertaking office at Mile 2 and Okota. We even wrote to their office in Ikeja before we contacted a non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Human Right Initiative Organisation, who intervened without success. “The negative attitude of the Ikeja Electric made us to organise this peaceful protest to enable the public to be aware of our plight. We are tired of their failed promises. They should do what is right, if not, we will keep protesting,” he said. Yusus appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to intervene. He said the governor should help by giving out prepaid meters to them as he promised during the celebration of his 100 days in office.
