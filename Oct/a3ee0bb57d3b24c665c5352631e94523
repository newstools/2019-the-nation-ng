  A POLICE Inspector attached to the Highway Patrol on Saturday night shot his wife and also took his own life after a disagreement. It was gathered that the policeman identified as Edward was allegedly drunk at the time he pulled the trigger at close range. The Inspector, whose wife was a Nigerian Correctional Service officer (NCS) Inspector at Ikoyi station, was said to have stormed their Warder Barracks flat late Saturday night which led to a fight. It was gathered that the couple were in the habit of quarrelling and their situation got worse after the lady opted out of the union. Her threat, it was learnt was borne out of the man’s alleged mistrust and possessive nature. In the heat of the disagreement, the policemen cocked his gun and fired at his wife and later shot himself in the head. The Nation gathered that their neighbours at Flat 1 alerted Ikoyi NCS officials who rushed the duo to the hospital. It was learnt that the woman passed on Sunday morning while doctors battled to save her and the Inspector died afterwards. When our Correspondent visited the barracks last night, it was observed that occupants of Block 1 had vacated their flats for fear of a possible arrest. NCS officials and plain-clothed policemen were seen in the vicinity just as traders at the barracks’ market discussed the issue in hushed tones. Our correspondent overheard some of the traders discussing that the incident happened upstairs. They claimed those close to the apartment said they overheard the woman screaming “why do you want to kill me.” “Those close to the woman said she had told the man she was not interested in the marriage again,” they said. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP) confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was ongoing.
