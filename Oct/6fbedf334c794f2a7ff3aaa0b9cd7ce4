Stephen Adigwu  PRINCIPAL of Bishop Howells Memorial Grammar School (BHMGS) Tunde Oduwole has stated that the only way out of the problems bedeviling the sports sector is through the development of school sports. Speaking at the annual inter-house sports competition of BHMGS held at CMS Grammar School in Lagos, the principal emphasised the importance of school sports to the development of sports in the country, stating that school sports remains the bedrock. “Sports has witnessed a tremendous transformation globally and especially in the educational sector. Sports has moved away from being an extra curricula activity to becoming a co-curricula activity and that is very key because it lays great emphasis on the simultaneous development of the body and the mind,” Oduwole added.
