 Two persons including a police inspector have been reportedly kidnapped in Rubochi community in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. It was gathered that the persons were kidnapped around midnight on Sunday by gunmen who stormed the community shooting at random. In the same community, the younger brother to a former Chairman of Kuje Area Council, identified as Mohammed Galadima, was also abducted only a few days earlier. A source who did not want to be named said the incident happened early around 2am on Friday, as the gunmen gained access to Galadimaâ€™s compound by jumping over the fence and picking him right in his house. It was gathered the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of N10 million. When contacted, the deputy spokesperson, Federal Capital Territory Police Command, ASP Mariam Yusuf, said she would get back to our reporter when she gets details.
