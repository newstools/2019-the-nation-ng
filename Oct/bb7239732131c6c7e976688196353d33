 Former Niger state Governor, Dr. Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu has called on the Niger State Government to explain how it spent a $181 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank. According to Aliyu, the loan was meant for the dualization of the Minna-Bida road adding that the money entered into the Niger State bank account after he had left the office. Speaking at the flag-off and presentation of flags to 25 chairmanship candidates of the People’s Democratic Party PDP for the November 30, 2019, local government election in Niger state, Aliyu wondered why the government did not utilize the money for the purpose it was meant for stating that the negligence of the government has led to the collapse of the road. “I went to Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to seek an interest-free loan to dualize the Minna-Bida road, but by the time the Money came I have left office in 2015.” He urged the people to demand the government to give an account of the money and the purpose it was expended for. “I want you to ask the government what they have done with the money. They need to explain and give account to the people. The former Governor then solicited to the people to vote for PDP candidates during the local government election adding that bringing in PDP at the local level would give the people the opportunity to enjoy the dividend of democracy. The former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso lamented over the declining state of the Suleja- Minna road adding that the government needs to sit up to its responsibility of providing good social amenities to the people. A large crowd of PDP faithful from the 25 local government areas of Niger state attended the rally.
