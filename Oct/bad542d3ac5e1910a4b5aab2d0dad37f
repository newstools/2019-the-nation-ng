Beautyklinik by Cerheeder, a makeup and skincare outfit has opened a new office in Ikoyi. The outfit, owned by a Laboratory Science graduate of the University of Lagos, UNILAG, Saheeder Olowu, will provide all skincare and facial services. Speaking during an interview, Olowu said it gladdens her heart that she is able to move closer to her customers as her first office was at Isolo.  “It gives my clients and my customers an opportunity to come at any time to pick up their goods and do a facial treatment. They can also get advice on how to use makeup and how to avoid reaction on their faces,” she said. While noting that she is the makeup artist of the wife of the chairman, Lagos Island East LCDA Kafilat Salau Bashua, she said she is glad that Mrs. Bashua could make it to the event. Olowu who has been in the business of beauty skincare for about eight years now, recalled that “It has been a long journey so far and to have this office commissioned today is not an easy task. It takes years of hard work and patient. I started to have passion for makeup when I saw that a lot of women were not doing it rightly. I don’t like seeing women applying makeup anyhow on their faces.”
