Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE), Ekiti State, has won the best place in this year’s Nigerian Universities’ Theatre Arts Festival (NUTAF). The university won gold in drama performance, third position in drums ensemble and best individual talents in directing, acting, costuming and make-up. A team of 25 students of FUOYE’s Department of Theatre and Media Arts (TMA), led by their Staff Adviser, Mr. Tayo Isijola, won the laurels at this year’s edition of NUTAF held at the National Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos. The feat came barely two months after the same TMA took third position in their maiden participation in a global event, African Drum Festival. Other departments in FUOYE, including Mechatronics, Food technology and Agriculture, among others, have also won laurels at different contests. A founding member of staff of FUOYE and pioneer Head of Department (HOD) of TMA, who is also the current Dean, Post Graduate Studies, Prof. Rasaki Ojo Bakare, said: “The implication of this feat is that for the next one year, FUOYE is the leader of all the 52 universities that offer Theatre Arts in Nigeria.
