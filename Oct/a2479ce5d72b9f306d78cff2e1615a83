By Nwanosike Onu, Awka and Emma Elekwa, Onitsha Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has commiserated with the Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese, Bishop Paulinus Ezeokafor, following the fire in his office on Saturday. Obiano visited the cleric’s office about 11.45am on Tuesday. Bishop Ezeokafor, who addressed reporters, said he was impressed with the governor’s quick response. The cleric said the fire started from the solar inverter. He thanked God no life and important documents were lost. “I was surprised to receive a call from the governor less than an hour after the incident happened because I didn’t know he was already aware. ‘’I was still trying to calm my nerves to get the details because I don’t like working under shock, when he insisted he must come to see things himself. “His coming here was not just to look at things, but to see what he can do. And I’m sure something is in the pipeline.”
