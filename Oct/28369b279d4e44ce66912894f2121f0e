Stories by Okwy Iroegbu-Chikezie Adron Homes, a integrated housing development company with estates in Lagos, Abuja, Nassarawa, Abeokuta and Ibadan, has launched a scheme to get the middle income class to own homes with ease. At the unveiling of a promo tagged “Lemon Friday Promo”, the firm’s Group Executive Secretary, Ayo Omoniyi, said the idea was to assist people to acquire property, land and house with ease. He said rather than buying clothes and toys for children on their birthdays, parents should invest on acquiring land and houses for their children with as small as N5,000 monthly. As an incentive to buyers, the company chief said various packages had been created. He said: “We will be taking over 70 prospective customers to Dubai, who take advantage of the various packages to buy-in-to any of our products. There are plans  to give over 1,000 cows to the lucky ones to celebrate the yuletide season.” At the event attended by stars, such as Patience Ozokwor (Mama G), Foluke Daramola, Princess, Funky Mallam, Omoniyi promised to establish an estate for celebrities. Mama G said the company’s product was not only real, but also affordable. She asked the company to make the proposed stars’ estate real. Daramola urged the company to use celebrities as a marketing strategy and carve a niche to reach a larger percentage of the population who would want to live close to Nollywood celebrities. Pledging the preparedness of the company to come up with star-studded estate, Omoniyi said they already had in their kitty the Association of  Nigeria Theatre Practitioners (ANTP), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Nigeria Police.
