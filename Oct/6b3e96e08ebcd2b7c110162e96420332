 THE Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) may have finally settled for the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom capital to hold the first leg qualifying match between the Super Eagles and their Beninese counterparts on November 13. Sources close to the NFF’s Glass  House in Abuja  had  last week revealed that  the Stephen n Keshi Stadium in Asaba was highly  favoured to host the match  ahead of  the  Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in  Benin and Godswill Akpabio Stadium in  Uyo. But the situation of things got clearer regarding the match venue after invitations were reportedly sent out to the respective state Football Association chairmen and secretaries notifying them of the impending NFF congress slated for the same November 13 in Uyo. “That means Asaba is no longer in the picture with the latest information,” said a source. The congress is expected to hold at 9 am, according to the source, after which members would head for the stadium to watch the match. The choice of Uyo if its stands would be a welcomed development to the players who were not rightly disposed to the condition of the pitch playing in Asaba.
