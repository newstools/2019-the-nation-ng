SUPER Eagles media officer, Toyin Ibitoye has revealed that team vice captain, William Troost Ekong would be psychologically and mentally ready for Nigeria’s international friendly clash against the Samba Boys of Brazil on October 13. Ibitoye told Soccernet.ng that the player and the technical crew have moved on from the alleged arrogance and disrespect against the defender during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Recall that last week, renowned journalist with BBC, Osasu Obayiuwana accused the Udinese defender of causing some level of unrest in the team camp at the tournament’ a story which has been debunked by the media officer. Ibitoye, however, disclosed that their major focus remains the game against Brazil and that they hope Troost-Ekong would be fit to play the game. “Willaim Troost-Ekong is a big boy and tough lad. And we have told him not to be bothered about it. Besides, he has moved on from such controversial comments because there is nothing to talk about it. We don’t dwell on what we can’t prove,” Ibitoye stated. “So, he is focus and always in touch with the coaches. He will be playing against Brazil and I just hope there won’t be injuries before the game. “In the absence of Ahmed Musa, he’s the captain of the team. So, there is nothing to worry about. He has ignored all those reports and moved on with his game.”
