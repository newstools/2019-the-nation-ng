Super Eagles new boy, Peter Olayinka, will be looking  forward  to  a good outing yet again as  Slavia Prague continue their good start in the UEFA  Champions League tonight as they welcome German giants, Borussia Dortmund, at the Sinobo Stadium. The Czech side came within a whisker of earning three points at Inter Milan, taking the lead through Peter Olayinka before Nicolo Barella rescued a point for Inter in stoppage time. Slavia are unbeaten in the league after 11 games, winning 9 of them with Olayinka scoring the only goal in their last match against Mlada Boleslav. Olayinka, 23, has scored four goals in 10 games for the Czech champions this season. The Champions league this evening will also see as Lille’s red-hot Victor Osimhen battle English giants Chelsea at home at the Stade Pierre Mauroy. Lille would hope Victor  Osimhen is in fine form to help them get over the 3-0 away loss to Ajax on Matchday 1. In Belgium, Paul Onuachu and Stephen Odey would hope to get some playing time against Italian side Napoli. Onuachu was on for just five minutes in Genk’s 2-6 humiliating defeat to Salzburg in Austria two weeks ago while Stephen Odey was not dressed for the game.
