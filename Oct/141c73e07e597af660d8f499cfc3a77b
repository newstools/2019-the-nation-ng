Adesoji Adeniyi, Osogbo  A storey building at Peter Ajibola Street in Alekuwodo area of Osogbo, Osun State capital on Thursday afternoon was razed by fire. However, no life was lost but property worth millions of naira was destroyed by the inferno. The landlady of the house, Mrs. Lola Olotu, who is an 80-year-old retiree, was said not to be at home when the fire believed to have been caused by upsurge of electricity broke out. Youths in the neighbourhood reportedly made efforts to put out the fire before the arrival of the men of the state Fire Service. An eyewitness, Mrs Omolabake Samuel, who commended the state Fire Service for prompt intervention, said: “Few minutes after Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) restored electricity, we saw one small boy running out from the building. He was coughing and we saw smoke coming out of the roof as a result of the fire outbreak. “But we thank God for promptness of men of the Osun State Fire Service. They really tried for us. If not for their immediate intervention, things would have gone out of hand.” Meanwhile, the Public Relations Officer of the Osun State Fire Service, Mrs. Adijat Basiri, confirmed the incident. Also, the Osun State Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr. Olalekan Badmus, who visited the scene of the fire outbreak to sympathize with the victims, called for calm. He appealed to residents of the state to avoid practices that could lead to disaster.
