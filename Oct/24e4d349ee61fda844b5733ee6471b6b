 THE Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has hinged the future of tax administration in Nigeria to technology. Its Executive Chairman, Mr. Babatube Fowler spoke when  a delegation of the Areas Youth Forum (AYF) led by its President Gambo Ibrahim Gujungu paid him a courtesy visit yesterday in Abuja. Fowler noted that giving the critical role ICT will play in the work of the service, the FIRS has launched an IT solution that has simplified tax payment. According to him, this IT solution “will ensure that all Nigerians carryout registration, pay all their taxes without visiting any of our offices. This solution can be used anywhere in the world.” From the time you register your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), you get you tax ID, pay your stamp duties online.”
