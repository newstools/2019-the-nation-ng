Enyimba head coach, Usman Abd’Allah has stressed that they have taken useful lessons from their painful exit from the CAF Champions League in the first round. The People’s Elephant were sent packing from the continental’s foremost club  competition by Al Hilal of Sudan 1-0 on aggregate after they played a barren draw with the North African side in Aba a fortnight earlier. Abd’Allah praised his players’ courageous display in Omdurman and described the only goal they conceded in the return leg as ‘stupid error’. He said it was unfortunate they had to exit the African club flagship competition but that they have taken the useful tips they learned and note it ahead of coming matches. “I will have to say that even though it was painful that we have to bow out of the CAF Champions League we were not disgraced out,” Abd’Allah said at his post-match interview. “We were eliminated with our heads held high. I want to praise my courageous boys who gave their all in Omdurman. “We could have achieved a better result if not for the injuries we had in the game,” he noted. I won’t like to comment about officiating but I can say that we have a good account of ourselves.” Enyimba will still have another chance to remedy their season in the second tier African club competition which they have dropped to when the draw for the CAF Confederation Cup is made in October 9 in Cairo, Egypt.
