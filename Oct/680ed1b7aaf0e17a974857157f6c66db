Faisal Abdulrasheed Maina, the 20-year old son, of former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, pulled a pistol on security agents when operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS) arrested both of them Monday, September 30, 2019. The Public Relations Officer of the DSS National Headquarters, Abuja, Dr Peter Afunanya, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. According to the statement titled DSS ARRESTS ABDULRASHEED MAINA, made available to reporters in Abuja, the DSS in a combined operation, on 30th September 2019, arrested Maina at the Pennsylvania Avenue Hotel in Abuja. He said the arrest followed a request by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to the Service to assist in the apprehension of the suspect. “Maina was arrested in company of his 20-year-old son, Faisal Abdulrasheed Maina, who unsuccessfully tried to resist the arrest. “The lad even pulled a pistol against the security agents involved in the operation. He was, however, disarmed and arrested. He is a final year student at the Canadian University of Dubai where he is studying Telecoms Engineering. “Items recovered from the suspects include a pistol with live ammunition, a bulletproof Range Rover SUV, a BMW Saloon car, foreign currencies, a phantom 7 drone and sensitive documents. “The suspects and the recovered items will be handed over to the EFCC for further investigations and appropriate necessary actions. “It is instructive to note that the operation is as a result of a renewed interagency collaboration among security and law enforcement agencies. “The Service has always subscribed to such collaboration believed to be important in national security management and therefore, hopes to sustain the initiative in mitigating the current threats against public safety and national critical assets,” the statement read.
