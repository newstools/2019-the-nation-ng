President of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) Ambassador Oladele Nihi has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the conferment of National Honour on Stephen Teru, the youth corps member who volunteered his skills to produce desks, tables, benches and shelves for the comfort of over 80 students and pupils. The apex youth body also asked the federal government to establish Teru in furniture business so he can further use his skills to produce more desks, table, benches and shelves for public schools in rural areas. Nihi, in a statement on Friday said:”Stephen Teru is one of many Nigerian Youths we should not just be proud of but encourage. He out of nothing used his skill to make something that is today trending on social media. Nigerian Youths are on a daily basis breaking records both at the continental level and the world at large with little or no support from government.” “This is why we are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to as a matter of urgent importance consider awarding Stephen Teru the Nigeria National Honour of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) and establish him. “This will no doubt encourage other Youth Corp Members to serve faithfully, diligently and use their skills and creativity to contribute to the country particularly the rural areas where they are posted to serve” Nihi thanked Teru for showing to leaders that youths are not lazy but are creative and always willing to contribute their quotas to the development of the nation. He urged other youths to emulate Teru to showcase their potentials to the world.
