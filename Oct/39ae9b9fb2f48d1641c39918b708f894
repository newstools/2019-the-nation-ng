There was jubilation in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, on Thursday as farmers received free fertilisers distributed by the Federal Government through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). The distribution was made at Makurdi industrial layout on the Naka-Adoka road. The fertilisers are meant for the farmers affected by flood and farmers/herders clashes. The Federal Government through NEMA had distributed farm implements to farmers across the country, including Benue State, to cushion the effects of flood and herders/farmers clashes. The head of NEMA delegation, Dr. Ejike Martins, said 1,000 farmers in the 23 local governments would go home with five bags of fertilisers. He assured the farmers that no fertiliser meant for Benue   farmers would be diverted to another state. A representative of the Commissioner for Agriculture and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Lady Helen Atom, said the greatest intervention was for the Federal Government to facilitate the quick return of victims of farmers/herders clashes, who were still in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps, to their homes. The beneficiaries hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for the intervention, saying they would use the fertilisers to boost food production in line with the Federal Government food policy.
