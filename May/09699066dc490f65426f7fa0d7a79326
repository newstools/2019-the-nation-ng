An Edo State High Court has sentenced Pastor Udoka Ukachukwu and his mistress, Eniobong Isonguyo, to death by hanging for killing an engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Victor Gabriel Isonguyo. The incident reportedly occurred in 2013. Isonguyo was the husband of Eniobong. He was killed by Pastor Ukachukwu. The NNPC engineer was killed and set ablaze, while his body was found after some days. Pastor Ukachukwu, who was having an affair with the late Isonguyo’s wife, was arrested when the vehicle of the deceased was traced to him. He could not explain how he sustained the burnt injuries in his hands. Justice G. Imadegbelo heard that the pastor used a sharp object in the engineer’s car to kill him (Isonguyo). He then set him ablaze in the car, in agreement with his mistress, who was then pregnant for him (the pastor). During trial, the court was told how millions of naira and landed properties, belonging to the deceased, were transferred to the pastor. Witnesses testified that the murder was carried out by the convicts to cover up the pregnancy accusation by the deceased, who insisted on knowing how his wife became pregnant while he was away. Justice Imadegbelo sentenced the two persons to death by hanging. Eniobong, who was four months pregnant at the time of the incident, was said to have given birth at the Benin prison.
