The producer of Okun Rice, HYST Global Business Limited, has donated rice to Muslims at the Nigerian Air Force base, Victoria Island, Lagos. The company’s Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Biodun Onalaja said Ramadan is an ideal period to engage in philanthropy. The gesture, he said, was part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). He said: “It is part of our social responsibility to reach out to the less-privilege and those who could not afford to buy our product. “Ramadan is the perfect time for everybody seeking for God’s blessing. So, my team decided that we should be donating our product to mosque around Lagos every Friday throughout the month of Ramadan. Today happened to be the third Friday, we are reaching out the Muslim. And also for them to benefit from our home-grow rice that is nutritious and full of fiber .” Onalaja urged Nigerians to desist from eating polished rice because it is less moisture and poisonous. He explained that polished rice refers to rice which has been milled to remove the husk, bran, germ, and vitamins, leaving a starch-rich grain. He warned that polished rice can also increases the risk of diabetes due to its long stayed on water and must have been preserved with chemical before importing it to the country. He appealed to the government to use all the security agencies to combat the smuggled rice into the country. This, he said, will help grow local rice industry and the economy.
