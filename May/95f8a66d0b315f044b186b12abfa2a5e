Ibrahim Mohammed, father of a rape victim, has explained why he forgave the man who raped his nine years old daughter. The suspect, Abdullahi Bala, aged 33, had pleaded not guilty to the offence when he was arraigned. He was said to have committed the offence by having unlawful carnal knowledge with the victim on February 8th and 9th, 2019 at Aduwawa Quarters in Ikpoba-Okha local government area. The victim told the Edo Family Court that she was raped twice. Ibrahim said he opted to leave vengeance for God because he is a man of peace. He assured that his daughter would be given the best education. Presiding Magistrate, D.I Adamaigbo, cautioned the accused person to stop lying by insisting he did not sleep with the victim. Adamaigbo warned Abdullahi to desist from the act.
