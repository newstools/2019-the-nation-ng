Musician Adekunle Temitope popularly called ‘Small Doctor’ has urged Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to impress it on the incoming administration to prioritise the construction of Agege bridge. The artiste, who spoke at the weekend at Agege Stadium as African legends gathered for a testimonial match in honour of Governor Ambode, said: “Neighbouring areas have their own bridges. I want to take pictures on Agege Pen-Cinema Bridge and send them worldwide. Please impress it on Governor-elect Babajide Sanwo-Olu to prioritise the project.”
