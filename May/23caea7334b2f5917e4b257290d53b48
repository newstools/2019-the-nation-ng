Participants at the cooperative housing workshop have resolved to set up two committees to harness the potential of the proposed Cooperative Housing Federation of Nigeria (CHFN). The just concluded two-day workshop was organised by Nigeria Integrated Social Housing (NISH) Affordable Housing Ltd., in collaboration with Family Homes Funds (FHF) in Abuja. The workshop had earlier called for the establishment of Cooperative Housing Federation of Nigeria (CHFN), Cooperative Housing Fund (CHF) and Cooperative Housing Information System (CHIS) to improve off-takersâ€™ chances of owing affordable housing at minimal cost. Former Managing Director, Police Mortgage Bank, Mr Benson Iyohmere, explained that the first committee would handle the formation of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that would harness the potential of the Housing Cooperative Federation of Nigeria (HCFN). Iyohmere said the second committee would look into cooperatives housing savings schemes, which would tackle issues regarding how to build savings for the new body.
