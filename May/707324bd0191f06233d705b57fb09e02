An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday sentenced a commercial bus driver, Simon Monday, to three years imprisonment for stealing a bus valued at N750,000. Magistrate K. K.. Awoyinka convicted Monday, 23, after he pleaded guilty to the theft charge against him. Before handing down the verdict, Mrs Awoyinka asked the convict if he had anything to say. Monday replied: “Please temper justice with mercy. I have learnt my lesson. Please allow me to go and work so that I can pay back the money for the bus.” Rejecting his plea, Awoyinka said: “You are hereby sentenced to three years imprisonment.” Earlier, prosecuting Inspector Oladejo Balogun, who reviewed the facts of the case, said Monday was arraigned on May 21, 2019. Balogun said Monday stole a T4 Volkswagen bus with registration number AAA 470 XR, valued at N700,000, sometime in February 2017, at Alpha Beach area, in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State. The bus belongs to the complainant, Mr Obasi Ikechukwu. The court heard that Ikechukwu gave the bus to Monday on the condition that he would remit N7,000, daily to the complainant. Monday failed to do so. Instead, he fled with the bus. The prosecutor said “The convict ran away with the bus and stopped picking the complainant’s calls, he moved out of where he used to live to an unknown place. At a point, when he picked his call, he told the complainant that he was arrested on Badagry road and that was why he couldn’t inform him about the development. He then switched off the phone again, until this year, following which he was apprehended. “The bus is what the complainant used to feed himself and his family. The defendant took the complainant’s source of livelihood from him and caused him so much difficulty, “Balogun stated.
