The 2021 Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup finals will be held at Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium from May 21 to 22, the European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) said on Friday. The 2018 finals held in Bilbao, home to Spanish soccer club Athletic Bilbao, while this year’s finals will be held in Newcastle’s St James’ Park. Tottenham’s stadium, which has a capacity of over 62,000, won the bid for the 2021 finals. “There is already a real buzz about the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and it will continue the theme of new experiences for our fans in dynamic stadiums,” EPCR Chairman Simon Halliday said. The new stadium, which will host NFL games apart from Premier League matches, will also allow Premiership Rugby side Saracens to play their annual ‘Big Game’ fixture from 2020 after they agreed on a five-year deal last month. “We’re excited to have been selected to host this prestigious weekend… in 2021 and to have this opportunity to welcome EPCR and rugby fans from around the world to Tottenham to experience our new home,” Tottenham Chairman Daniel Levy said. “These games will add to the portfolio of world-class sporting and entertainment events our multi-use venue will stage in this new leisure destination for London.” Saracens play Leinster in this season’s Champions Cup final on Saturday while Clermont take on La Rochelle later today in the Challenge Cup final.
