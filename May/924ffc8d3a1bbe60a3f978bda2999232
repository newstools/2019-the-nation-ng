The Sokoto State Police Command on Monday paraded 23 suspected criminals arrested for banditry and other offences. They included a notorious kidnapper, Mohammed Dangaladima, aka “Bajini”. Briefing reporters, Police Commissioner Mr. Ibrahim Ka’oje said Dangaladima, who was arrested at Mailalle village in Sabon Birni Local Government, had been on the police wanted list for the past one year. He said: “The suspect has been operating within the axis, using arms. We are still investigating to recover from him an AK47 rifle believed to be used by him.” Ka’oje also confirmed the arrest of a suspect, saying kilograms of a substance suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered from him. He said the suspected main dealer, Hali Customs, had fled. The command’s crack team, Ka’oje said, had arrested Alhaji Zakks, a shop owner who specialised in burgling stalls and stores at the Sokoto Main Market. “He operates under the guise of a shop owner. After the close of business, he remains behind and locks himself in his shop after everyone must have left. He burgles shops and carts away goods and money,” the police boss said. He said the suspect had before his arrest, burgled shops and stole items and cash worth over N6 million. “Investigation shows that the suspect used part of the proceeds from the crimes to acquire landed property,” Ka’oje said. Items recovered from him include a Honda Accord car, cash and others. Also recovered from by the police crack team during the operations were weapons, mattress, Keke NAPEP, blinds, woolen mats among others. He said the command would sustain its proactive tempo to ensure the success of the newly introduced “Puff Adder” operations, adding that the public should cooperate by providing the police with information to enable them tackle crimes and chase criminals out of the state.
