Two persons have reportedly died following more than an hour of heavy downpour which caused flood in many streets in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom state capital. The deceased persons, a man and woman were discovered in a gutter along Atiku Abubakar lane by GWT fuel station in Uyo, eyewitnesses said. Our correspondent reported that the rain started at about 5.30pm on Sunday and did not stop until about 6.45pm. According to an eyewitness, Uduak Mbakara, the unidentified victims who were found dead inside the gutter on Monday morning were not residents of the area. She stated that residents of the area called the police who promptly responded and carried away the corpse. “We woke up this morning to find the corpse of a man and a woman in the gutter along Atiku Abubakar lane. Since we could not identify them, we called the police who came and carried the corpse away,” she said. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Odiko Macdon confirmed on Monday in Uyo that the police has taken the corpses and deposited them in a morgue. He said the police believe that the victims were electrocuted by the naked electrical wires inside the gutter as a result of a fallen electrical pole, adding that foul play was suspected in the death. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the victims were electrocuted because some fallen electrical poles were found around the area, giving the impression that they died of electrocution. But our investigations have not been concluded,” he stated.
