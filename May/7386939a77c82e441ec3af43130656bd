Angry fans booed the London side in the first half, bemoaning the seemingly lack of ambition of their favourite club. But Ruben Loftus-Cheek headed Chelsea in front in the 48th minute, nodding home an Eden Hazard cross from a corner routine. And three minutes later the home side had a second, this time David Luiz scoring with a header direct from a Hazard corner. The third came in the 75th minute as Pedro slid in Gonzalo Higuain and the Argentine coolly dinked a finish over the onrushing Ben Foster. Maurizio Sarri takes his side to Leicester City next Sunday and three points will guarantee a return to European footballâ€™s elite competition. ESPN
