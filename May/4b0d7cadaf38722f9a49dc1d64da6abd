Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has appointed a former commissioner, Engr Ahmad Bashir, as Secretary to the State Government (SSG). He also appointed a broadcaster, Solomon Kumangar, as Director of Press. Another broadcaster, George Kushir, was appointed the Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Sett Crowther. The appointments, the first to be made by the governor after his inauguration on Wednesday, take immediate effect. Ahmad Bashir, the new SSG, was the Commissioner for Works and Housing during the three months that Fintiri acted as governor in 2014. The new Director of Press, Solomon Kumangar, is a broadcaster with the Adamawa Television (ATV) where he rose to become the Director of News; while the new Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, George Kushir, is a Yola-based reporter with the AIT. Swearing in the SSG on Thursday, Governor Fintiri told him that his choice as the SSG was informed by his record of integrity, and urged him to continue in that light. Responding, the new SSG said fixing Adamawa would require tough decisions that might be unpopular with some people but he said he was not afraid in hurting some people for the overall good of the state.
