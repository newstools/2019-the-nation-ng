Gunmen have shot dead a senior official of the Delta State Polytechnic, Ogwashi-Uku, Mr. Chukwudi John. The incident reportedly occurred in Aniocha South Local Government. The deceased was said to have been killed on Wednesday night at Chi Hotel junction. It was gathered that the late John, popularly called Mr. Biggi, was shot six times at close range while leaving the hotel. The institution’s spokesman, Mr. Manfred Oyibode, who confirmed the death, said: “The police are handling the matter. It will not be wise for me to make categorical statements on it now. “He was not killed on the school premises. The news that filters in says he was just coming out from the hotel when unknown persons shot him. He was a non-teaching official.” Police Commissioner Mr. Adeleke Adeyinka said nobody has been arrested, adding that the information about his death is still sketchy.
