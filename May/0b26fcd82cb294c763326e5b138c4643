The Old Students Association of Community Grammar School, Igboegurin, Ondo State, has concluded plans to build a modern laboratory, equip the library, and renovate the school hall of their alma mater. The plan follows the provision of borehole and toilet facilities for the over 40-year old school. The decision was reached during the association’s quarterly meeting at Sappers Barrack, Nigerian Army, Ilese-Ijebu, Ogun State. The association’s President, Rev. Elisha Emaye, however said the old students should not be left alone to carry the burden of addressing the infrastructural needs of the school and appealed to the Ondo State government and agencies to assist them. “The old students association sank borehole for the students; we built a standard toilet for the school as part of giving back to the school and community.  But we are not stopping at that. We want to embark on renovation of the school hall, build a modern laboratory and a well-equipped library for the school. “The association cannot do it alone, but we are seeking help from government agencies and relevant stakeholders so as to achieve this goal,” Emaye said. Also, Dr Bamidele Fagbounka, a member of the association and lecturer at the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago – Iwoye, harped on the commitment and cooperation of members as key factors necessary for the realisation of the planned projects. Similarly, Mr Omojuwa Segun said the projects when executed would make life, teaching and learning more meaningful to the students and the community. Segun expressed the optimism that the association would get support from many stakeholders.
