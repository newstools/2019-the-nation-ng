The senator representing Ondo North senatorial district, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice on Friday said he had nobody in mind as governorship hopeful for the 2020 election in the state. Besides, he affirmed that he was not interested in the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as being speculated. The lawmaker denied the claims by some governorship aspirants in the Ondo APC that he had endorsed their governorship bids. Through a statement from its spokesman, Kayode Fakuyi, the ranking senator said he was conversant with how some governorship aspirants have been making frantic efforts to woo and lobby prominent leaders within his political structure to support their governorship aspirations since his decision not to run for governorship position. It said  “First, Prof. Boroffice believes the intense jostling for APC governorship ticket in Ondo State is too early. Having had an unimpressive outing in the 2019 general elections, this is the time for all leaders, stakeholders and party members to unite for genuine reconciliation and re-energize the party. “Instructively, while it is true that the lawmaker has no intention to vie for APC governorship ticket in 2020, it is untrue that he has endorsed any governorship aspirant. Hence, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice has no preferred aspirant. “Furthermore, all political associates and supporters of Boroffice in Ondo State are urged to keep faith with the APC and the process of revitalizing the party in Ondo State” The lawmaker urged them to exercise patience until such an appropriate time that they would all sit together to take collective decision on the next governorship election in Ondo State.
