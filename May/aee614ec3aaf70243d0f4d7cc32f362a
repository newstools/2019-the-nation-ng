People living with disabilities, under the aegis of Movement for Disability Forum, have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the law which prohibits discrimination against them. They said they should be allowed to enjoy the dividends of democracy, as enshrined in the constitution. The group’s Coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, said yesterday at a stakeholders’ forum organised for the newly-elected politicians on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform, said the law should have been signed since because it was passed years ago by the legislature He  said Nigerians with disabilities were facing  hardship because of the absence of the law, noting that since 1999, “successive presidents have refused to sign the National Disability Bill into law without any logical reason.” According to him,  the condition of the people living with disabilities is nothing to write home about, as they wallowed in abject poverty. Oshilaja enlisted the support of the public and the international community in getting the law signed. He urged the elected officers not to forget them after being sworn-in on May 29, “because we voted for them despite our predicament.”
