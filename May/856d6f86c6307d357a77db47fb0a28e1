A driver, Ayeyi Adegboye, has reportedly crushed two motorcyclists to death. The incident happened along Erinje-Okitipupa road, Okitipupa in Ondo State and involved a wine colour Audi car marked KTP 668 RG. Eye witnesses who spoke with reporters in Okitipupa on Thursday gave the names of the deceased as Olaniyan Akinmoye and Sola Akinlose. Bode Akinmoye, a family member of one the deceased, said although the driver was apprehended by the Okitipupa Police Division, the case was not being handled as required by the law He said some powers that be wanted to hijack the case so that the offender is not brought to book. His words: “The driver over sped on the highway on that fateful day and crushed two motorcyclists, Olaniyan Akinmoye and Sola Akinlose, to death. “The driver has been arrested by the Okitipupa Police but since then, we did not hear anything about the case again. “I think some powers that be want to hijack the case so that the offender will not face the law. This is injustice.” He said that the deceased were returning from Ode-Erinje when the driver allegedly ran over them. Efforts to speak with Okitipupa Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Olubukola Abe were not successful. It was also learnt that the case has not been charged to court. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Femi Joseph,a Superintendent of Police( SP) however confirmed the incident. He said the accused driver was not the one who killed the motorcyclists, saying he only had an accident at a scene different from where the cyclists were killed. Joseph said investigations were ongoing to ensure that the culprit was apprehended by the police. According to him: “The alleged driver was not a culprit, his car is in our custody but he has been released partially on bail but investigation is still on to apprehend the original culprit.” The remains of the deceased were however taken to the Okitipupa General hospital.
