The Speaker of the Imo state House of Assembly, Rt. Acho Ihim, has resigned his position few weeks to the inauguration of the new session. The embattled Speaker tendered his resignation letter to the Clerk of the House, Chris Duru. The Deputy Speaker, Hon Ugonna Ozurigbo also resigned in a similar manner just last week. It will be recalled that 21 out of the 27 lawmakers had during a brief but rowdy plenary, suspended the Speaker and the majority leader, Lugard Osuji, over what was described as conduct against the interest of the members of the House. The aggrieved lawmakers who served an impeachment notice on him, announced, Chinedu Offor, member representing Onuimo Local Government Area, as the acting Speaker. The Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Marcel Ekwezuo, confirmed the resignation. Ekwezuo said “the Speaker has resigned. He tendered his resignation letter today, May 28. He is grateful to his colleagues and the people of Imo state for the opportunity to serve as the number third citizen of the state for four years now.” But a lawmaker told our correspondent that him resigned because of fear of being impeached. The source said “yes, he has resigned but beyond the reason given, he played a fast one by resigning before he is impeached during the next plenary. He knows that after today, he will no longer get the executive backing to remain as the speaker until this Assembly comes to an end. He preferred to leave with the governor which is the best for him.”
