The manufacturing sector is producing at slightly above 51 per cent, the Manufacturers’ Association of Nigeria (MAN’s), report has shown. In the report by the Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI), MAN said the sector’s 51.3 per cent level of productivity was inadequate and called on policy makers to increase the tempo of responsibility to stimulate output. MAN said there was need to continuously fine-tune the forex policy in the country, particularly as it concerns the manufacturing sector, saying that most MAN CEOs do not agree that the rate at which commercial banks lend to manufacturers encourages productivity in the sector. The report lamented the un-justifiable double-digit cost of borrowing from the  commercial banks, they said discourages investment, insisting that Commercial Banks’ loans to the manufacturing sector do not encourage productivity. It is therefore important  that a policy should be designed to improve the proportion of commercial banks loanable funds that goes to the manufacturing sector, the statement added.
