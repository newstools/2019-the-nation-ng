The Nigerian Air force said on Tuesday that no fewer than 20 bandits have been killed through air strikes in Zamfara state. According to the spokesman of the Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, the strikes also destroyed the camp of a major kingpin of the bandits known as Alhaji Lawal. A statement supported with a declassified video clip said the attacks on the bandits were carried out after intelligence reports have established their presence in the area. Daramola said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) for Operation DIRAN MIKIYA has recorded a major success against armed bandits in Zamfara State by destroying the camp of a major kingpin, Alhaji Lawal, and neutralizing up to 20 of his fighters near Rugu Forest in Zamfara State. “This was accomplished in a dawn attack executed on 26 April 2019 after credible intelligence indicated that the notorious kingpin was camped, along with dozens of his fighters, at a settlement about 4 Km West of Rugu Forest, where he keeps his logistics supplies, coordinates operations and launches attacks against security forces as well as innocent civilians. “Consequently, following detailed confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the ATF dispatched one Alpha Jet and an attack helicopter to strike the camp. “The Alpha Jet strikes recorded direct hits on the camp destroying the armed bandits’ structures, fuel storage containers, arms, explosives and other logistics supplies, which were seen engulfed in flames. “The attack helicopter carried out mop-up attacks on the target. No fewer than 20 armed bandits were neutralized in the air strikes. “The NAF, working in consonance with surface forces and other security agencies, will sustain its operations to flush the bandits out of the Northwest of the Country.”
