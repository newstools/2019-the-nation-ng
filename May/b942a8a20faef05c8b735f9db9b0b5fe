The police in Anambra State have arrested members of a four-man gang for alleged kidnapping. The suspects allegedly wore military uniforms to deceive and kidnap people. Three of them, including a lance corporal in the Army, were wearing military uniforms and vests when they were nabbed by the police last Friday after allegedly abducting Uchenna Ezeonu in Ekwulobia, Anambra State, the police said. The suspects, Obasi Peter, Benjamin Nicholas and Ojiegbe Obinna, were arrested alongside three suspected accomplices. Confirming the arrest, police spokesperson Haruna Mohammed said the victim was rescued unhurt. Said he: “On May 24, at about 11am, there was a distress call from Isuofia Road in Aguata Local Government that three persons in military uniforms abducted Uchenna Ezeonu of Omeke village, around Ekwulobia roundabout and took him away to an unknown destination. “Following the call, operatives attached to ‘Operation Puff Adder’, in conjunction with the joint patrol teams, rushed to the scene and cordoned off the area in search of the hoodlums along the bush path, near Uyo-Eke Market Road.”
