The Diocese of Isiala Ngwa, Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, headquartered at St. Georgeâ€™s Cathedral, Umuomainta, Isiala Ngwa North Local Government Area of Abia State, has reportedly dismissed four priests for engaging in homosexuality. This was contained in a notice of dismissal which allegedly emanated from the Bishop in-charge of the Diocese, Rev. Temple Nwaogu, to all the church branches under it. The notice identified the dismissed priests as Rev. Emmanuel Nwankwo, Rev. Kelechi Nwachukwu, Rev. Sunday Azubuike and Rev. Chris Achonye. The notice said the licenses of the accused priests had been withdrawn following an investigation and recommendation submitted by the panel of enquiry who found them guilty of homosexual practices. The release also warned the public against dealing with the dismissed priests. The dismissed priests could not be reached for comments and Bishop Nwaogu, who promised to get back to our reporter, did not do so as at last night.
