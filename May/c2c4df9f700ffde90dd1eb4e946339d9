Peter Asset Providers (MAPs) approved by the Federal Government, to bridge the metering gap of 4.7 million are strategising to achieve the objective, it was learnt at the weekend. The firms, it was gathered, have sourced for local and international associations, with a view to understudying them and getting the required knowledge for the job. This, the source said, was done to meet up with the difficulties of meeting the needs of consumers in the six geo-political zones of the country. According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the firms have evolved a partnership arrangement with the 11 power distribution companies (DisCos), as stated in the metering guidelines given to them by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). Electricity Meter Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (EMMAN) Executive Secretary, Mr Muhideen Ibrahim said the task is rigorous and that the approved companies, have decided to give the job the seriousness it demands to achieve success. He said the firms have done their jobs well and are ready to carry out the responsibilities given to them by the Federal Government. The approved MAPs, he said, may have started operation on (May 1), as scheduled, adding that that they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the DisCos on the issue. Ibrahim said: ‘’The DisCos have procedures for variations and pricing of meters and I hope the meter asset providers are going to operate in line with the requirements of the firms.”
