Former Super Eagles striker, Uchenna Nwofor has backed Nigeria to do well at the forthcoming AFCON in Egypt due to the array of talents in the national team. Nwofor who was part of the late Stephen Keshi’s 23-man team list for the World Cup in Brazil, spoke to Sports247. “I so much believe in Nigeria, I have no doubts that they will do well because of the talents in the team”. “With the results, we have been getting now, that is the national team, I want to believe it will be a morale booster for them ahead of the two friendly matches and in Egypt for the Nations Cup”. Nwofor last attempted comeback in the Algerian top flight was halted in devastating fashion couple of months back when the Nigeria international picked up a serious knee injury. The 27-year-old moved to Kabylie last year in a bid to relaunch his career. It’s been five years since the striker’s career was ‘on the up’, as he enjoyed three seasons in Dutch football with VVV-Venlo and SC Heerenveen.
