The Provost, Tai Solarin College of Education (TASCE), Omu-Ijebu, Ogun State, Dr Lukmon Adeola Kiadese, has appealed to both academic and non-academic staff of the college to return to work for the betterment of the students, staff, and overall survival of the institution. He made this appeal against the backdrop of the fact that he and other senior management staff of the institution had been barred from their offices four about four months by angry workers, who asked them to be resuming at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta, to press for their salary arrears. Speaking to journalists in Omu-Ijebu, Kiadese said the government was ready to pay the salary arrears and other benefits the workers demanded. “I can assure you that as soon as the state subvention is remitted into the institution’s coffer and the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the institution is realised, their salaries will be paid, as the government is aware of their predicament. Though we owe them salary arrears, it is not intentional as they assume,” Kiadese told some reporters. He said no institution could owe its workers as it was against the rules. He said he would leave no stone unturned to ensure that the backlog was paid. Kiadese said the strike was having a negative effect on the students and the institution’s calendar – extending a course of three years such as National Certificate on Education (NCE) to about four to five years. He appealed to the Chairman of the Coalition of the Tai Solarin College of Education (COTAS), Comrade Daniel Aborisade and his members to sheathe their sword and embrace dialogue as violence, protests and blackmail could not solve the problem. “I am appealing to COTAS and its leadership to make a peaceful resolution possible, as continued violence and protest could not solve the problem of the institution, because it’s government that is owing them not me (Provost), why now barring me, Bursar and other management from entering into offices?, I really couldn’t understand this act of lawlessness,” Kiadese said
