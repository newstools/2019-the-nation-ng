The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) yesterday presented a certificate of return to the winner of the last Saturday Councillorship by-election in Ward A (Obele/Oniwala), Surulere Local Government Area. Kazeem Bello, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), polled 793 votes to defeat his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opponent, Abdulateef Bolaji Sanni, who got 195 votes. LASIEC Chairman Justice Ayotunde Phillips (retd) congratulated Bello and his party, on their victory. She urged him to see his election as an opportunity to serve the people and champion their cause, stressing that the councillor-elect must “be seen to be a servant of all regardless of political affiliations or differences.” Represented by an Electoral Commissioner, Olusegun Ayedun, the LASIEC chief noted that the commission demonstrated its commitment by providing “ a level playing field for the two political parties and their candidates in the election and ensured that people’s votes really counted.” She promised that the commission would continue to conduct free, fair and credible elections. Justice Phillips, however, expressed disappointment over voter apathy during the election, adding that it was inexplicable that less than ten per cent of registered voters in the area cast their votes during the exercise. The Nation learnt that there are 11,095 registered voters in the ward. While pointing out that this was a challenge which the commission was ready to tackle by stepping up its Continuous Civic and Voter Education programmes, Justice Phillips said the commission expected key stakeholders, including leaders of political parties, elected office holders and appointees to conduct themselves in manners that would inspire confidence in the citizenry and motivate them towards more active participation in the electoral process. Bello hailed the commission for ensuring that the election was free, fair and credible.
