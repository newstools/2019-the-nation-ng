The Chairman of a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Sustainable Livelihoods and Development Network for Africa (SLIDENAFRICA), Prof Kola Adebayo, has expressed concern over  abandoned irrigation projects across the country. He said it was hindering the country from  achieving food security. Adebayo said despite promises made by the government, dam and irrigation projects worth billions of naira were wasting away. He urged the government to support irrigation improvement to enhance food security and reduce poverty in rural areas. According to him, there was  the need to improve and strengthen the country’s irrigation institutions, including assistance to increase farmer participation. He explained that inefficiency and mismanagement of irrigation and dam projects may worsen food insecurity. He advised the government to revive the River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs) to enable them boost agricultural production in the country. He said the revitalisation of RBDAs would strengthen efforts to create opportunities for increasing food production, imploring the government to resuscitate the abandoned projects. Despite positive trends in agricultural production, experts say the country still experience food shortages, attributed to unavailability of water for irrigated agriculture in many areas.
