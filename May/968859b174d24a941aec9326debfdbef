The police  yesterday refuted reports that an officer with Ago Division in Okota, Lagos,  chased a motorcyclist to death over an alleged N100 bribe. The motorcyclist, the police said, was killed by a hit-and-run driver. In a video, which has gone viral, it was alleged that the unnamed policeman, described as tall and dark, encountered the motorcyclist in front of Century Police Station, Ago Palace Way, Okota. The motorcyclist was said to have been crushed by an oncoming vehicle after he fell off his bike in front of the station around 6am. But  in a statement, police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the motorcyclist oversped and crashed into a speed breaker before he was knocked down by a Toyota Camry. He said the allegation that a policeman chased the victim to death was false. Elkana said: “The fact is that on May 8, at about 6:05am, the men and officers at Century Police Station heard a loud sound a few meters from the station and rushed out to ascertain what happened. They found a motorcyclist lying in a pool of blood, with his motorcycle on the ground. “The victim was taken to hospital, but he eventually died. On inquiries from eyewitnesses, it was gathered that the motorcyclist was involved in an accident with a vehicle on the Ago Palace Way. “A witness, Mr. Adedayo Benson, narrated that he was standing in front of Century Hotel and saw the motorcyclist, who was speeding, run into a road bump/speed breaker. “The motorcyclist reportedly applied his brakes, but was hit by a Camry car coming behind. The driver of the car escaped before the police arrived. Investigation is on to arrest the driver and prosecute him.”
