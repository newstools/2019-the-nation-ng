The Oyo State Police Command said yesterday that it had arrested a suspected arms dealer who supplied weapons to the hoodlums terrorising residents. Addressing reporters at a parade of the suspects at the Eleyele Police Headquarters, Ibadan, Commissioner Mr. Shina Olukolu said the suspect wreaked havoc, adding that with his arrest, residents will now enjoy peace. He said 29 other suspects were also arrested for offences such as kidnapping, cultism, robbery, among others. Olukolu said the suspected arms dealer was arrested last Saturday at his Ibadan hideout following a distress call to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). He said 2,750 live cartridges were recovered from the suspect who sold arms and ammunition to robbers and kidnappers. “The cartridges were recovered in an unregistered Toyota Corolla car parked in the area. Further investigation is ongoing,” the police boss said. He said the command also arrested four suspected members of a notorious gang of armed bandits, who invaded Oke Funfun Housing Estate in Ojoo. Olukolu said the suspects, who killed 70-year-old Robert Abayomi, a member of the community, during the operation, carted away valuable items and money. He said the arrest followed discreet investigation by the personnel attached to the “Operation Puff Adder”, adding that they had  confessed to the crime. According to the commissioner, items recovered from the suspects are 20 phones, two cutlasses, three knives, one sledge hammer, one wooden gun, two Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards, weeds suspected to be Indian hemp and foreign currencies among others.
