 Jose Mourinho has been ‘offered a three-year deal’ to take charge at Roma, but the special one is not one to accept an offer without conditions. The former Manchester United boss has been on the job hunt since his sacking last December and the Serie A side are front-runners as it stands. According to L’Equipe, the Portuguese will only take up the role if Roma qualify for next season’s Champions Lea The capital city club are currently fifth, one point off Atalanta in the final spot for next year’s competition. There are still four games to play so Roma have every chance of sneaking into the top four, drastically increasing the chances of Mourinho taking charge having had ‘multiple meetings’. As it stands Claudio Ranieri is the interim manager in the Eternal City until the end of the season. They are not the first club to chase Mourinho’s services since his departure from Old Trafford. Former side Inter Milan also made an approach but PSG are considered the most likely alternative to Roma as it stands. Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has also held talks with former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, who has been out of work since being sacked from his post at Stamford Bridge. Talks between Mourinho and Roma have been progressing well, and he is eager to get back into management with a club that will back his philosophy and show patience. His relationship with key players in the dressing room at Manchester United soured, particularly Paul Pogba. And after a poor run of form, culminating in the 3-1 defeat by rivals Liverpool at Anfield last December, Mourinho’s time at Old Trafford came to an abrupt end. No doubt he’ll be desperate to reestablish himself as one of the greatest managers of his generation in his next role. Jose who turned 56 in January has coached seven clubs in the course of his coaching career with two time sojourn at the Stamford Bridge.
