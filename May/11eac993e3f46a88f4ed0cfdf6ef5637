An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, yesterday sentenced an unemployed man, Taye Oluwaseun, to two years imprisonment for stealing items worth N350, 000. Oluwaseun, 27, was arraigned by the police on May 2 with a guard, Abdulwaheed Mohammed, 20, on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Oluwaseun pleaded guilty, while Mohammed pleaded not guilty. At the resumed hearing yesterday, Magistrate K.K. Awoyinka sentenced Oluwaseun after reviewing the facts of the case. She sentenced Oluwaseun to one year imprisonment on count one (conspiracy) and one year jail term on count two (stealing). “Both sentences shall run concurrently and shall take effect from May 2, when the defendant was arraigned,” Mrs. Awoyinka said.
