To wage war against quackery in the health sector, the Ogun State government has unveiled the first edition of the directory of registered private health facilities in the state. Unveiling the directory in Abeokuta, the state capital, Dr. Babatunde Ipaye, the Commissioner for Health, said it was produced to meet the yearnings of stakeholders who desire best services. “The administration of Governor Ibikunle Amosun is determined to provide qualitative, affordable and accessible healthcare services for our people. It is in line with this collective mandate to transform the health system of Ogun State that this directory of registered private health facilities in Ogun State is making its debut. “This holistic approach is aimed at weeding out unqualified and unfit private health facilities like hospitals, clinics and maternity homes, laboratories, diagnostic and scan centres, physiotherapy clinics, among others. The fight against medical quackery is evidently a big battle. However, the good news is that we are making steady progress at winning the war,” Ipaye said. He urged stakeholders to embrace the initiative and collaborate with the  government to eliminate quackery, cautioning the public not to patronise unregistered health facilities. Also, the Director of Hospital Services in Ministry of Health, Dr. Yusuff Quudus, said the maiden edition of the directory contains accredited health facilities, their locations, owners and phone numbers. He noted that the list would be updated yearly to include new registered facilities and that those that have been closed down would be deleted. The Chairman, Association of General Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, Ogun State branch, Dr. Rabiu Kushimo, also lauded the initiative, saying it would give the residents the opportunity to access quality healthcare delivery.
