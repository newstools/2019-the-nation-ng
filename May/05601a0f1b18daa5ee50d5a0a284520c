The District head of Daura in Katsina State, Musa Umar, has been kidnapped by gunmen. Umar, a former Customs officer, is married to the daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari’s sister. He is also reported to be the father of Fatima Musa, wife of Mohammed Abubakar, Buhari’s aide de camp  (ADC). Police officers are on the trail of the criminals. Witnesses told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the kidnappers stormed his home at 7p.m. and sporadically shot into the air, scaring bystanders, who scampered for safety. Umar had just returned from the mosque where he took part in the evening prayer when the incident happened. He was sitting in front of his house with some people when the gun-totting men came. A witness told NAN that the kidnappers came in a Peugeot 406 saloon car. After the gunmen left, the Daura Council Chairman Malam Abba Mato and hundreds of sympathisers came to Umar’s residence, to discuss the incident.
