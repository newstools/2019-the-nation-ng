Trainee aircraft of the Kwara state-owned International Aviation College (IAC), Ilorin on Wednesday this week reportedly crash-landed at the airport runway. The incident affected Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed flight, who was said to be returning from his Abuja trip. The governor and his wife were said to have been delayed as a result of the incident for about three hours before arriving at the airport. The governor, who had his convoy stationed at the airport around 2:22pm waiting for his arrival from Abuja airport, had to wait until the airspace was reopened and the governorâ€™s chartered aircraft landed at the airport at exactly 5:35pm. The Diamond plane No.5N BNH with two pilots onboard crashed landed at exactly 11:05am without any casualty. It was, however, gathered that the staff of the IAC, including the rector and some of the airport workers, had evacuated the aircraft from the runway in order to reopen the airspace for flight operations. It was gathered at the airport that the aircraft might have experienced gear problem, adding that the back tyres refused to pullout when the pilot was trying to land on the runway. When contacted, the Airspace Manager of Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) at the airport, Engineer Balogun Abiodun, said that he was not authorised to talk on the incident as a civil servant. Also, the Rector of the Aviation college Benedict Adeyileke, an engineer declined comment when contacted. It was also gathered that the aircraft was towed to the Aviation College before the airspace was reopened around 4:00pm for flight operations.
