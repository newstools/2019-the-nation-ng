Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has alleged that the Army staged a coup against Rivers State during the general elections. He described the action as the worst in the country’s democratic history. Wike, who addressed the joint House of Representatives Committees on Army, Police, Human Rights and Justice at the Government House in Port Harcourt yesterday, said the Army acted illegally because they were working to impose a pre-determined leadership on Rivers State. He said: “It is really unfortunate; all of us know that there was a coup in this state, organised by the Army. In the history of this country, it has never happened where, during ordinary election, Army will begin to kill people for no just cause. “Because they believe a particular person or a particular party must win, it doesn’t matter how many people die. It was shown on television. We watched how the Army invaded the whole electoral commission. “This is the only state the Federal Government has never assisted to fight insecurity.  Instead of us to team up and fight insecurity, you politicise it. Even if you make recommendations, nothing will happen. I don’t know whether we are in a military regime or civil administration.” The governor noted that aside the Army, the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARs) has been a major anti-democratic force in the state since the 2016 rerun elections. He lamented that F-SARs murdered a PhD Holder and Chartered Accountant because they wanted to subvert the people’s will. The governor wondered why the General Officer Commanding 6 Division of the Army was still unpunished despite the negative roles he played during the elections. “The GOC here is a politician. Nothing has happened to him because he was sent. If it was when the country was a country, you cannot be keeping that GOC. He is sabotaging the security network,” he added.
