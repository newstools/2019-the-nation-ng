There is need to make intellectual property (IP) laws more effective, legal experts have said. They spoke at the Second Annual Business Series organised by the firm of Duale, Ovia and Alex-Adedipe. Its theme was: “Investment in Nigeria’s Telecommunication Media and Technology”. According to them, the legal framework for the protection of copyright and other intellectual property in Nigeria “is not yet where it needs to be”. They said lawyers and the regulators need to meet and discuss regularly on how to make it more efficient. Strengthening the intellectual property space, they said, will lead to more foreign direct investment especially in the technology sector. They noted that of all foreign investments that came into Africa for the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) industry, the largest chunk came to Nigeria, with Microsoft also announcing that it will be investing about $100million. A resource person, Kenneth Muhangi said: “The protection of software is possible. It is being done over there in East Africa and can also be replicated here.” He urged the IP registration body to research more about software protection. Muhangi added: “In East Africa, they have also studied the Blockchain technology and adopted it in IP protection. “Blockchain will keep record in an online ledger that only the business owner and the server administrator have access to. That way, leaks will be reduced to minimal level and it is also secured.” Muhangi said IP valuation is also an issue in Nigeria. “When discussing with an investor, we must try not to disclose our trade secret for our protection,” he said. Another IP expert, Kenneth Obiajulu, said the need for IP protection cannot be over emphasised. The panel was chaired by the Chief Risk and Legal Officer InterSwitch Mr. Gbenga Haastrup. It also featured former Diamond Bank Plc Chief Executive Officer Mr. Uzoma Dozie.
