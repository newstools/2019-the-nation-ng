Kano state Commissioner of Health, Dr. Kabiru Ibrahim Getso has said that over 567 people died of diseases attributed to malaria in 2018 Getso who spoke during a press briefing to mark the 2019 African Vaccination Week and World Malaria Day, also stated that the  Kano state government had spent over N500 million to combat and eliminate malaria in the state within the last two years. According to him, the money was spent through the distribution of free anti-malaria drugs to various health facilities across the state. He said, “94 per cent of confirmed uncomplicated malaria cases recorded in 2018 was treated with about 567 deaths attributed to the disease. In economic terms, malaria morbidity and mortality led to loss of billions of Naira in cost of drugs, hospital stay, man-hour loss, and other out-of-the-pocket expenses.” “In Kano state, malaria is the single most common reason for outpatient consultations and visitation. It is estimated that in 2018, there were more than 1.3 million hospital visits (34.4 percent of OPD attendance) and one percent of the total public hospitals and admissions, as well as 54 percent of the referrals through the newly designed two-way hospital referrals system, were due to the menace of malaria.” He also said the Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s administration has also provided malaria diagnostic kits, free malaria prevention drugs to women, as well as distribution of free long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in all the 44 Local Government Areas. “Malaria can be easily prevented by limiting ones exposure to mosquitoes and mosquito bites, pointing out that the prime point of attack by mosquitoes is at night when people are asleep.”
