Seven people have died in an avalanche in Russia’s Altai Mountains as rescue workers flew out to the site on Wednesday, authorities said. Two people managed to survive the avalanche and the two-day journey to inform authorities, as a wireless communication connection could not be established in the remote area, state media reported. The avalanche occurred on Monday in the proximity of South Chui Ridge, striking a tourist group from the Russian city of Novosibirsk, the Emergency Situations Ministry said in a statement. The area is located within Russia’s Southern portion of mountain range, where it borders three Asian countries: China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. NAN
