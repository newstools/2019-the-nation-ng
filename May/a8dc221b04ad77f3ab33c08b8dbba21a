Muhammad Fawehinmi, son of the late lawyer and rights activist, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, has promised to always re-echo his late father’s call for a Sovereign National Conference (SNC). Fawehinmi said this is the panacea for the nation’s multi-ethnic, social and religious upheavals. He said no theory, idea or initiative would set the country on the path of greatness without the convocation of the SNC. According to him, this will produce people-oriented constitution the nation needs to take its rightful place as a great country inn the comity of nations. Fawehinmi was the reviewer of a book, titled: Nigeria Is a Lie: A British Lie that Must Be Finally Structured, which was launched at the weekend at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Conference Centre. “A lot of people are agitating for a restructuring of Nigeria, but I tell you that will never work until we convoke a Sovereign National Conference,” Fawehinmi said. He added: “We have 464 tribes in this country. They must be represented. “For now, we don’t have a constitution. The constitution we use now was drafted by the military. All the tribes and ethnic nationalities need to have a cohesive agreement, not like the one (former) President Goodluck Jonathan did in 2014.” Fawehinmi said he happily embraced the idea to be the reviewer of the book because it aligned with his father’s repeated agitations for SNC before he passed on in September 2009. The 210-book, he said, has nine chapters which reveal sordid details of the British shenanigans from the pre-independence to post- independence to exploit Nigeria’s resources and prevents its citizens from being united. The book, Fawehinmi said, exposes the lacuna in the MacPherson, Littleton and other pre-independence constitutions, culminating in some nationalists calling for Nigeria’s independence.
