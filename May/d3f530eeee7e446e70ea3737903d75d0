The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared that its leadership and elected federal legislators have not taken any official position on who to support for the position of presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The party’s position is predicated on reports in a section of the media suggesting that its members-elect in the House of Representatives have settled for a particular aspirant as the new Speaker. A statement Sunday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party was still consulting with its members-elect and no official position has been taken on the issue. It reiterated its position that positions of presiding officers are not the exclusive preserve of the ruling party or any other party for that matter, but a constitutional right of every elected lawmaker in their respective chambers. The statement said: “Moreover, the PDP has an array of elected lawmakers, in both chambers, who are eminently qualified and equally popular among their colleagues, across the divide, to hold office as presiding officers of both chambers of the National Assembly, in line with Section 50 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).  “What is important to Nigerians is the emergence of a purposeful leadership that will ensure accountability and good governance in the polity. “The PDP, as a party committed to the wellbeing of our nation, will remain focused in our determination to rescue our nation from incompetent system and therefore urges Nigerians to discountenance such reports suggesting that our lawmakers have settled for a particular aspirant for any presiding office in the National Assembly”.
