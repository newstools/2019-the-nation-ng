The Bauchi State Government has distributed foodstuff and clothing materials to 2,000 orphans and children across the state. Head of Monitoring and Evaluation of the Bauchi State Orphans and Vulnerable Children Agency (BASOVCA) Malam Rilwanu Maidawa, explained that the distribution of the items to the vulnerable children by the agency was an annual event. “It has been a yearly affair in the state and each of the beneficiaries will be given a token to sew the clothing materials. The food items include rice, vegetables oil, semovita, milk and sugar, while the clothings are bundles of brocade and wrappers,” he said According to him, the beneficiaries are selected from the three Senatorial Districts in the state. He said 50 households in each of the senatorial districts would benefit from the items. Maidawa stated that the gesture was to enable the children to celebrate Sallah festivity with ease, thereby giving them a sense of belonging among their peers. “The food items and clothing materials will be distributed under strict supervision and monitoring to avoid diversion,” he said. Maidawa hailed Governor Mohammed Abubakar for assisting the orphans and children in the state.
