The national coordinator, Consolidation Group for Nigeria 2023, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Barrister Rabiu Garba Butu-butu, has called on Governors in the North to borrow a leaf from the methodology adopted by Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufa’i of Kaduna state in combating the menace of armed banditry in their states. The group made the call on Thursday in a chat with reporters, saying Governor El-Rufai had “beyond any reasonable doubt exhibited high resilience and courage in confronting the spectre of insecurity and armed banditry in Kaduna state in recent time.” Butu-butu in his address said “treating high profile criminals who often took solace in decimating innocent people with kid-gloves would only bolster their confidence to perpetuate their sinister designs. He said no criminal should be spared  the war to checkmate the excesses of those destabilising peace at the expense of the security of the nation, stressing that “no nation can develop and attain the height of greatness, progress and prosperity without entrenching a sound and formidable security system.” “What is needed most at present is the resilience and doggedness of an aggressive governor who in the slightest act of provocation is ever ready to respond with brute force, most especially when the atmosphere of peace is jeopardised. “Governor El-Rufa’i stands to be a good presidential material after President Muhammadu Buhari completes his tenure in 2023. People like him deserve to be given the mandate to preside over the affairs of the country.”
