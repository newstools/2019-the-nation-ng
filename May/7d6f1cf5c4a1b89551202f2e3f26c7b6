 President of the Nationwide League One (NLO) told the media in a chat, “Having learnt a lesson the hard way in the last edition, we want to be the championship giant-killers. “Recall the team got knocked out by eventual winners Rangers International of Enugu, this time around we want to improve on that, “I have urged the players to give their 200 percent in the game against Kogi Utd. “The NNL side are not invincible, they don’t scare us and they are beatable as we have seen them lose to other teams this season.” Asked about the motivation behind setting up the club, “The need to get youths off the streets from social vices and create a platform for them to achieve their dream, inspired me to establish the football team.” “I have passion for the game and I played football but not to professional level as I once took part in the Pepsi Academy. “Our target is to feature in the Nigeria Professional League (NPFL). However we have other age grade teams, the U-17, U-15, U-13. The U-15 team will before the end of the year be in Denmark for an invitational tourney.” As regards Sunshine Stars escaping relegation on last day of the 2018/19 seaaon. “Its good feelings that Sunshine Stars retained its NPFL status. Big kudos to the team as it wasn’t easy, the stadium atmosphere was tensed but at the end, the team did it in style winning 4-2 against MFM FC of Lagos and with Dayo Ojo scoring a hat-trick.”
