Chief Executive Officer of Micro Media Group Mrs. Shileola Ibironke of the newly inaugurated Heritage Mall, Abule Egba, Lagos has said the country was yet to fully tap into Cinema business. Addressing reporters at the commissioning, she said Nigeria can actually boost its revenue base, if investor were encouraged. She said the mall would provide different services for those watching films and shopping for their home needs. She said: “Heritage mall is actually and entertainment centre, comprising shopping and cinemas. We have space for artistes to come to perform, producers who are interested in showcasing new talents.” Shileola said Heritage Mall, Abule Egba was sited there because of the need to make residents watch good cinemas instead of travelling to highbrow areas. “So, we intend to open up this community, particularly as we observe that cinemas are mostly concentrated in highbrow areas. “It is going to open employment opportunities for the youth. Those who are roaming the street doing nothing will do something meaningful for themselves. “It will accommodate people with skills and those who do not have the expertise but could be deployed to activities that would enhance their lives. “The Alimosho Local Government Area is obviously lacking in terms of Cinemas where people can find time to relax for the weekend. ‘’Most of these people now go to high brow areas before they can actually watch good films.”
