Legislators raise estimates by N90b SOME OF the figures SENATors passed yesterday the  N8.916 trillion 2019 Appropriation Bill. But the long expected approval of the budget raised little excitement in the private sector. Reason: The organised Private Sector (OPS) is not sure President Muhammadu Buhari will sign the document, which has added N90 billion to his estimates. Besides, said private sector operators,  the passage of the bill, few weeks to the end of the tenure of the administration, came rather late. The N8.916 trillion passed for the 2019 fiscal year is contrary to the N8.826 trillion presented by President Buhari to a joint session of the National Assembly on December 19, 2018. The passage of the budget in the Senate followed the consideration of the report of the Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Mohammed Danjuma Goje. The figure was also passed by the House of Representatives following the consideration of the report of the House Committee on Appropriation. The implication of passing the same figure by the two chambers is that there will be no need for harmonisation. The lawmakers jacked up the budget by N90 billion, including the N10 billion approved for Zamfara State to be added to the Service Wide Vote. The Senate had in a motion resolved to approved N10 billion to Zamfara to cushion the effects of humanitarian crisis arising from sustained banditry in the state. The lawmakers set aside the sum of N23,678,770,079 as severance gratuity for outgoing legislators and legislative aides, allowances for incoming legislators and legislative aides and induction programme/inauguration of the ninth assembly.

Public service wage adjustment for MDAs (including arrears of promotion and salary increases) and payment of severance benefits to take N160,000,000,000. Military operations, including Lafiya Dole and other operations of the armed forces to gulp N75,000,000,000. Settlement of MDAs electricity bills N5,000,000,000 while IPPIS capturing will take N2,000,000,000.

Goje explained that the slight increase in the budget deficit as a result of the provision for the severance benefits of the outgoing legislators and legislative aides, the induction/orientation and inauguration of the new legislators “all of which occur once in four years but were inadvertently not captured in the 2019 budget proposal. He noted that there was also the need to provide more funds for the security and intelligence agencies to deal with additional emerging/unforeseen security challenges in the country.
