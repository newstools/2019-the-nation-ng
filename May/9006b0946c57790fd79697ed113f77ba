• To sanction uncooperative members The re-elected member of the House of Representatives from Wase, Plateau State, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Wase, may have been endorsed by his party, All Progressives Congress (APC) to become the next deputy speaker of the House, according to indications yesterday. Wase, who initially wanted to contest for the Speakership, recently dropped his ambition and agreed to work with the party’s choice for the office, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila (Surulere, Lagos). He had met with President Muhammadu Buhari in company of his State Governor, Mr. Simeon Lalong. Representative Abdulmumin Jibrin (Kano) who is the Director General (DG) of the Femi Gbajabiamila campaign council hinted on his Twitter handle yesterday that Gbajabiamila and Wase would run on a joint ticket. His words:  “MURUS!!! Mr Speaker and Mr Deputy Speaker 9th Assembly. If you are an APC member and against the two, you are on collision course with the party. 2015 is NOT 2019 in so many ways. We are assuring our 360 colleagues, Femi and Wase will run an all-inclusive House.” Only last week, the campaign organisations of Gbajabiamila and Wase collapsed into one after a meeting of their supporters at Transcorp Hotel, Abuja. Wase,55, was first elected into the House in 2011 and was re-elected in 2015 and this year.
