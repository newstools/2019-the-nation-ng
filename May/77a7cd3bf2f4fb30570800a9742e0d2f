Last week, we shared the story of 33 miners who were trapped underground in the Copiap√≥ mining accident. For the first 17 days, it was impossible to know if attempts were being made to rescue them until the first drill broke through. Despite that surge of hope that they had been discovered, they still spent another 52/53 days before being rescued. We examined two of the virtues of the miners that ensured that all 33 of them survived until their rescue and they are Courage and Hope. Today, we shall examine a few other virtues that can be valuable to us: They never saw the sun for 69 days, yet they found reasons to laugh. When you are gloomy, not only do you bear the full burden of your problems, you also scare away those who may want to assist you. Imagine if the miners were in a foulmood and they cursed the rescuers for not moving fast enough. How motivated would the rescuers be to keep going? When you have a positive disposition to your challenges, you help people to help you. Thanks for reading my article today. I would really love to hear from you.
