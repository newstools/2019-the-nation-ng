MultiChoice has announced a partnership between its flagship initiative, the MultiChoice Talent Factory (MTF), and the New York Film Academy College of Visual and Performing Arts (NYFA), a world-renowned visual and performing arts school. According to MTF Academy’s Director (West Africa), Femi Odugbemi, the partnership is in line with MTF’s mission of igniting Africa’s already established creative industries through training and skills development, as well as to foster new and original programming. MTF Director Cheryl Uys-Alli added that MultiChoice’s commitment to partnering industry experts, such as the NYFA, is to promote and protect the growth of Africa’s creative industries. She noted that the endorsement of the MTF by NYFA confirms the film school’s continued efforts to the empowerment and development of filmmakers across the world. She said: “For more than a decade, the NYFA has supported African content creators and performers by hosting workshops across the continent, where the institution’s faculty has met with thousands of students in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya and further bridged its hands-on intensive training in both the visual and performing arts as well as offering information sessions, auditions, and portfolio reviews to attendees. “Through this partnership, MultiChoice continues its commitment to boosting capacity in the continent’s creative industry.” NYFA Vice President Jim Miller said the institution is delighted to be part of the process to upgrade skills of African film and television professionals. “The New York Film Academy is honoured to be a part of the enrichment, development, and fostering of storytellers across Africa, a continent steeped in a rich history of dynamic, creative and passionate visual and performing artists “Over the years, NYFA has been privileged to have hosted hundreds of students—from dozens of African nations—many of whom have found outstanding success in their national industries when they returned home. “This MTF and NYFA collaboration is a natural extension of our commitment to help bolster the skills of talented African storytellers,” Miller said.
