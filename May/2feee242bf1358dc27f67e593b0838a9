Global largest long haul carrier, Emirates Airline,  at the weekend, said operating in the country over the last 15 years has come with a huge challenge because of infrastructure deficit. Its Regional Manager, West Africa Commercial Operations, Afzal Parambil, who spoke with reporters during an interactive session to mark the 15-year operation of the carrier in Lagos, said it has done well nonetheless. He said it is not easy for businesses to be successful in the country because there are lots of challenges in the operating environment. The Dubai based airline said the country’s aviation industry is not yet a mature market, stressing that there are a lot of growth opportunities for carriers to explore. Parambil said: “Emirates has enjoyed a strong relationship with Nigeria, and remains deeply committed to the market. Over the past 15 years, we have not only seen our operations grow, but our product develop to cater to the taste and requirements of our Nigerian customers. We constantly strive to provide our passengers with an unforgettable travel experience, and our growth is a testament to the fact that we are on the right track.” He said the airline started operations in the country with flights to Lagos in 2004, a key gateway to West Africa, with four flights per week from Dubai to Lagos linked with Accra in Ghana, operated by the A330-200 aircraft.  The following year, he said it increased its services from four to six flights a week, and following further demand, it became a daily operation in October 2005.
