Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani-Bello on Monday night dissolved the state executive council. He directed all Commissioners to prepare and hand over the affairs of their Ministries to their Permanent Secretaries. He also directed all other political appointees to do same and handover to the most senior civil servant in their departments or agencies. The Governor said that the handover should be completed on or before 12 midnight on Tuesday. The directive was given during the valedictory session of the council after a meeting that lasted for seven hours. He appreciated the council members for offering themselves for the service of the state at a crucial period like this when the state did not have adequate resources at its coffers. “I want to express my profound gratitude to all of you. I appreciate your commitment to the service of our dear state. You all have contributed immensely to the social contract we had with our people four years ago. The modest actualisation of the “Restoration Agenda” was a product of our collective efforts. “I want to wish everyone of you success in your future endeavours while I implore you all to remain committed to the development of our dear state. Your valuable contributions are highly appreciated and I make bold to say that you all have done well.”
