Fifteen banks owe the federal government a total of N1, 586,662, 611 in under remittances of Stamp Duties funds. This was part of the findings in the report of the Hon. Abubakar Ahmed-headed Ad hoc committee that investigated the Non-remittance of Trillions of naira of Stamp Duties into the federation account. The report though was slated for consideration at the Committee of the whole of Wednesday in the Green chamber, it was however postponed till a later date. The banks are Guaranty Trust Bank (N198,326.300); Standard Chartered Bank (N3,658.193), Citi Bank (N1,860.,850), Stanbic IBTC (N231, 094,565), Zenith Bank (N265, 635,650), Fidelity Bank (N32, 888,400), Keystone Bank (N24, 471, 050) and United Bank for Africa (N81.087,149).

The report noted all banks were found not to have made full disclosure in Stamp Duties collections and remittances and should be further investigated. It further states: “All the Banks that had cases of delayed remittances should be penalized. “In view of the apparent lack of transparency on the part of most financial institutions, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should strengthen its supervisory activity to ensure that Financial institutions  report and remit all government revenues correctly and promptly.” The report urged that defaulting banks “be made to pay with interests the amount they under-remitted for the period under review.” Similarly,  the lawmakers said that First Bank,  First City Monument Bank,  WeMA Bank and Suntrust Bank disregarded the summons of the committee and neither sent representation nor appeared at the public hearing, hence it recommended that the listed banks be further investigated.
