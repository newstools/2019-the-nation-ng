Emmanuel Gyang and Deborah Pam, winning the male and female events in the Nigeria category at the 2019 Okpekpe 10km International Road Race as a couple was the perfect gift they would have wished for. Gyang and Pam tied the knots on the 1st of May before coming to Edo State to dominate the Nigeria category at the IAAF Silver label race. Gyang finished in the time of 31:42 to emerge winner in the male event, while Pam finished first in the female event with the time of 38:13).
In a chat with NationSport after winning the Okpekpe Road Race for the third time in a row, Gyang said he is delighted for the first title as a couple. “While we were preparing for our wedding, we were also preparing for the race too. So three days after our wedding, we resume training for the race. Winning the gold medals in both male and female categories was our plan and we thank God that we met our target. We worked harder to retain the title. “This is a perfect wedding gift for us. This is our first medal since we got married and it is the beginning of blessings for us. “Our plan now is for the Nigeria Armed Forces on the 16th of June and then prepare for African Games in Morocco. We will continue to work harder,” Gyang said. Pam, who has been winning the women’s race since the inception of the competition, said she was happy to prove doubters wrong this time. “I feel very happy and excited that I still maintain my title. The way I heard about the race, I thought I will not make it due to some situation. Even some of my running partners were telling me that this time around I cannot make it because I got married and I told them I show them I didn’t relax and when I won the race, I was so happy,” Pam told NationSport.
