The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is being intimidated and blackmailed by politicians with a history of election rigging in the state. The Akwa Ibom State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mike Igini, who addressed a news conference at the weekend, said those accusing the commission of irregularities rigged elections in the past to get government positions. Igini was reacting to allegations by the All Progressives Congress (APC), and its lawyers, that INEC was preventing it from accessing and inspecting electoral materials. He said: “Akwa Ibom is the only state where the opposition is complaining of being denied access to materials but the complaints are deliberate. Those with a history of election rigging are the ones accusing the commission. The complainants cannot compare what happened in 2011 and 2015 to the 2019 elections.” Igini flayed the APC lawyers and petitioners for accusing it of not complying with the Tribunal order to inspect election materials. According to him, the Commission has complied with the tribunal’s orders in line with the provision of Sections 77 and 151 of the Electoral Act, to make available to petitioners, certified copies of election materials, and also to be open to petitioners. “The APC governorship candidate’s lawyer, Victor Iyanam, informed the commission of the tribunal’s order on April 25, and was told to return the next day so that INEC’s legal team could jointly work out the inspection schedule, but he never turned up. “Now, in between the waiting time, Iyanam already granted news conferences and issued statements, accusing the commission of denying them access to materials. But this is untrue. We are committed to the electoral accountability to ensure electoral justice.” Igini explained that since April 23, inspection of materials had been happening daily for Akwa Ibom Northeast and Akwa Ibom NorthWest Senatorial seat.
