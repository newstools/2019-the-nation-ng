The Supreme Court has fixed May 24 for judgment in the appeal by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the last governorship election in Ekiti State, Olusola Kolapo Eleka. The appeal is against the March 28, 2019 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which upheld the January 28, 2019 judgment of the Ekiti State Election Tribunal, affirming the victory of Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election. A five-man panel of the court, headed by Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, chose the date on Thursday after listening to arguments by lawyers to parties. Lawyer to the appellants, Yusuf Ali (SAN), while adopting his clientâ€™s brief, urged the court to uphold the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Ali argued that the appeal. essentially was for the court to streamline the position of the law as it relates the practice of front loading in trials.
