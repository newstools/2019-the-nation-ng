MTN’s Nigeria plans to list on the Nigerian Stock Exchange tomorrow, a spokesman for the South African company said. MTN decided to list its local unit in Nigeria in 2016 after agreeing to pay a $1.7 billion fine to settle a subscriber identity module  (SIM) card dispute with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The company has previously said it planned to list in the first half of 2019. “We are aiming to list but we can’t give you a hard date,” the spokesman said, adding that tomorrow was MTN’s preferred date, though today and Friday this week and Wednesday and Thursday next week are also options. Two sources had earlier told Reuters that MTN aimed to list its business in the country tomorrow, after holding a meeting with analysts about its plans last week Monday. Last week, Nigeria’s securities regulator approved MTN’s application to list Nigerian unit. A source said the stock exchange was processing MTN’s application for the listing tomorrow.
