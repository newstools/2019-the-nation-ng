Leading Information Communications Technology (ICT) frim, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (“MTN”), has paid the sixth and final installment of N55 billion to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). This completes MTN’s payment of the N330 billion negotiated settlement agreed between the NCC and the company in 2016, a statement signed by its Senior Manager, External Relations, Funso Aina, explained. MTN’s Chief Corporate Relations Officer, Tobechukwu Okigbo, said the successful resolution of the fine was the outcome of active collaboration between the NCC and MTN. “We are very pleased to have completed the payment of the N330 billon negotiated settlement with the NCC. We are particularly gratified to be in a position to have fully met the terms of the settlement within the agreed time frames. “I would like to thank the NCC for their constructive and collaborative approach to this issue, and believe that we emerge from it with a stronger relationship, focused on ensuring maximum value is delivered to our people, from a strong and growing telecoms sector.” It will be recalled that MTN and the NCC reached a negotiated settlement in relation to the fine imposed on MTN in 2015 as a result of a dispute over the disconnection of unregistered subscriber identity module (SIM) cards amongst its subscriber base.
