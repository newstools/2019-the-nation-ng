The decadence in the society has been attributed to bad parenting. A cleric, Imam Shakirudeen Abdul Gafar made this known at a Ramadan Lecture organised by the Muslim Association of Nigeria (MAN) in Surulere, Lagos Nigerians, he said, need to prioritise proper parenting because of the significant roles it plays in the society. Abdul Gafar stressed that parenting starts from making the decision to choose a spouse. He said: “Because of your children, you need to select a good mother for them. Parenting starts from the choice of woman a man wants to marry. Whoever wants to have good children and get parenting right has to marry an upright, modest and pious woman. “Islam has stipulated certain considerations for choosing a wife; family lineage, beauty, wealth and her religion. But, Prophet Muhammad emphasised the religion because it will regulate every other inadequacy that comes with her. The wife must be economically viable. She should have skills to sustain herself and family. The woman makes it easy or difficult for the man to train the children.” According to him, the choice of woman to marry is very imperative in parenting because the mother is the children’s first institution of learning. “That’s why we have to be extremely selective. The family of the wife is very important because every family has peculiar gene that runs through the blood of its members. This must be well considered because of issue of domestic violence, for example,” he said.
