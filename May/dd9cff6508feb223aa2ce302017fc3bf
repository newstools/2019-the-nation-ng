The governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, has been told to stop meddling in the politics of a sophisticated state like Lagos and concentrate on the security challenges facing his state. A Yoruba group, the Coalition of Odua Self-determination Group (COSEG), in a press statement signed by the chairman of its coordinating council, Comrade Ifedayo Ogunlana , said that “the Kaduna State governor does not possess the requisite knowledge of democratic development on Lagos State, and as such he should not involve himself in the politics of the state”. The group condemned in totality the inciting statements of the governor who has done little in reducing or eradicating the insecurity in his state. Ogunlana said: ”We are amazed that el-Rufai could state what was attributed to him. This statement of his cannot be taken seriously in Lagos because Lagos has witnessed massive infrastructural development under the present leadership since 1999. “Every political leader in Nigeria has attested to the development of Lagos, and this has been because of great progressive leaders led by Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu. He laid the blueprint of a new Lagos which successive regimes have been following and which has led to the economic development of the state and massive infrastructure.” Ogunlana further said: “We, therefore, warn Governor el-Rufai to leave Lagos alone. Lagos is miles away from Kaduna in leadership and infrastructural development. Our own people are very conscious and our leaders care so much about people’s welfare. The progressive political leadership in Lagos has successfully developed it to a state of envy.  Our people are not also sentimental and beclouded by ethnic or religious issues. “We urge him to have a change of heart and face Kaduna governance steadily rather than waste his time on Lagos.”
