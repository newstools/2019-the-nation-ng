Residents of Akoko in  Ondo state have cried out over rising cases of ritual killings in the four local government areas of the section of the state. No fewer than six women  have been killed recently by suspected ritualists in the area. The  killing of an 80-year old woman, Mrs Kojusola Mogaji from the famous Mogaji family in Arigidi-Akoko last week has created panic and apprehension in the ancient town. Residents condemned the dastardly act, describing it as heinous. The octogenarian was  murdered and her breasts removed by yet-to-be-identified persons suspected to be ritual killers. A one- time Vicar-in-Charge of St Lukes Anglican Church, Imo-Arigidi, where the deceased worshipped until she was gruesomely killed, Revd Canon Isaac Awowole and his wife described the late woman as a committed member of the church. He noted that perpetrators of this evil act would meet their waterloo for spilling human blood. A younger brother of  the deceased, Vincent Sunday, described his sister as an asset to the family. He said the victim  was a mother of five who raised her children in Christian way . He urged security agents to do the needful and fish out the perpetrators of the dastard act. Another family member of the deceased, Mrs Kehinde Adewumi, urged community leaders to put an end to ritual killings in Arigidi community. The chairman of Akoko Northwest Local Government, Elder Samson Akande, who paid a condolence visit to the bereaved family of the late octogenarian assured that government would get to the root of the killings.
