Bandits in the early hours of Tuesday attacked Dan-Ali village in Danmusa LGA, Katsina state and abducted three persons. They also carted away money and other valuables during the attack around 1.25am. A resident, Malam Tukur Dan-Ali told our correspondent on phone: “The bandits in their dozens arrived at the village around 1:25 am and kidnapped three young persons, (our relatives) one of which is women, carted away money and valuables. “They shot sporadically and made their way into the houses of Alhaji Musa and Alhaji Gambo where they kidnapped the three persons. ‘’The bandits had however released one of the victims, Hajiya Fatima unconditionally.” He added as at 5:30am that security forces were yet to arrive the village. Contacted, spokesman of The Police Command, Superintendent Gambo Isa, requested for more time to confirm the incident. But he was yet to get back as at the time of filing this report. In a related development, residents of Katsina state have called on the police command to charge the recently paraded kidnap and banditry suspects to court. They challenged the police to test the recently signed death penalty for kidnapers and cattle rustlers into action One of them, Alhaji Tasiu Mohammed, said rather than stocking their brimming cells with suspected kidnappers, the police should decongest them by charging them to court as quickly as possible He said: ‘’Let them be charged to court as a test case for the newly signed law on kidnapping and cattle rustling, it will surely demonstrate government’s seriousness in dealing with insecurity challenges in the state.’’
