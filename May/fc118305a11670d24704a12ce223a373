Kano State Commissioner for Higher Education Dr Muhammad Tahir Adamu has admonished executive members of the Joint Consultative Forum (JCF) to always channel their grievances appropriately before embarking on industrial action. Adamu gave the advice while receiving executive members of Joint consultative forum of polytechnics State branch who call on him at his office. He said it was high time for the trade union to change their format of threatening government with strike, rather than dialogue before embarking on strike as last option. The Commissioner then advised the JCF to suspend its proposed three-day warning strike to allow the ministry to intervene by contacting the relevant authorities for lasting solution. Earlier, the Chairman of the State JCF, Comrade Muhammad Haruna said their visit was to congratulate the Commissioner for his appointment and intimate him about lingering issues between the academic staff of the institution and government. He said that the problem of promotion of their members as guided by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) scheme, retirement age of 65 years as gazetted by the Federal Government since 2010 and implemented by some  neighbouring states like Katsina, Jigawa, Bauchi and Niger states were among the issues provoking the forum to opt for industrial action. Haruna added that non- payment of Peculiar Academic Earned Allowance, which is seven per cent of basic salary of the academic staff out of the institutions’ Internally-Generated Revenue (IGR), was another issue. The chairmen implored the government to urgently look into the issues for immediate solution.
