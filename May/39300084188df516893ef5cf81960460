A treasurer at the Apostolic Church of Nigeria, Friday Robbinson, who allegedly swindled a senior pastor of N850,000, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. The police charged Robbinson, who lives at 18, Bankole Street, Isheri, Berger, Lagos, with two counts of theft and obtaining under false pretence. Prosecuting Sergeant Michael Unah alleged that the defendant collected N850,000 from Pastor Victor Ekong on the pretext of introducing him to oil and gas business, a representation he knew to be false. He said the defendant committed the offence last August about 10:25am at 2, Olanipekun Street, Mobil bus stop, Ore-Ira, Ogba, Lagos. Unah alleged that the defendant, an elder and a treasurer in the church, obtained the N850,000 from the complainant and relocated to an unknown destination. “The defendant approached the complainant that he wanted to introduce him to oil and gas business. “The complainant initially transferred N500,000 to the defendant’s First City Monument Bank’s (FCMB’s) account and also gave him N350,000 belonging to the church. “The defendant stopped coming to church and fled to an unknown destination the moment he collected the money,” the prosecutor said. The offence, he said, contravened sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015. (Revised) He pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate A.A. Fashola admitted the defendant to N300,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on June 17.
