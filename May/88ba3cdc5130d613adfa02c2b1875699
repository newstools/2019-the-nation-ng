Industrial unions and professional associations  have been urged to sustain the harmony in the sector by embracing peaceful  engagement with their management. Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) Managing Director Capt. Fola Akinkuotu gave this charge at an interactive session with  unions and representatives of professional bodies at the agency’s headquarters in Lagos. He said the call became necessary as “no organisation can thrive in an atmosphere of rancour and disharmony. Capt. Akinkuotu praised the unions for their cooperation  to his administration. He urged them to communicate with management on any issues requiring attention. “There were many instances where the boat could have been rocked but the unions or associations came together and we were able to resolve the issue or reached some kind of consensus and it has worked well for us,” he said. The NAMA boss cautioned staff members over unnecessary and frivolous expenditure, such as “incurring duty tour allowances (DTA) for flimsy reasons,” saying that  they  should apply moderation and minimise wastage to enable the agency channel its resources towards more meaningful ventures. Akinkuotu  decried the indebtedness of state aerodromes to the agency, noting that efforts were being made to prevail on defaulting state governments to pay. On the condition of service, among other entitlements to staff workers, the NAMA helmsman said NAMA management would ensure that approval was given by the government. He revealed that a meeting had been slated between NAMA management and relevant government agencies to hold before the end of the month  to resolve the issue. Earlier, the NAMA’s Director of Human Resources and Administration Maira Bashir said the forum was aimed at fostering harmony in the workplace. “Over the past two years, we have co-existed in harmony and it is our prayer that this relationship anchored on friendship, mutual respect and maturity shall continue to blossom,” Bashir said.
