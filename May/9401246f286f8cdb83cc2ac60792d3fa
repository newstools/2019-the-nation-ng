ARTICULATED vehicles have not been authorised to park under the Marine Bridge  at  Ijora, and  on its adjoining areas in Apapa, Lagos, the state government said yesterday. In a statement by Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mr Tunji Bello, the government said it had not created any temporary park under the bridge or elsewhere in Apapa and Ijora for trailers, warning that trucks found in the prohibited areas, henceforth, would be towed. The government denied claims by some highly placed politicians, trailer owners and  drivers that such parking lot had been created. Bello said the government would ensure compliance with President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive that trucks illegally parked in Apapa be removed “The government has not given any approval or permit to any politician, individuals, owners, no matter how highly placed or corporate bodies to park articulated vehicles under the Marine bridge, Ijora, other bridges or the major roads and setbacks in Apapa,” the SSG said. The government, he said,  had instructed security agencies to be deployed for the exercise not to spare any illegally parked truck. Bello reiterated the government’s commitment to ensure the re-beautification and landscaping of the setbacks and parks illegally occupied by the trucks. He noted that the setbacks under the bridge, which were beautified six years ago,    were spoiled by the truck drivers. The SSG assured the public that government would soon end the drivers’ unwholesome activities.
