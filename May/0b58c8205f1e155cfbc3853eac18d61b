The Adamawa State Government has received over one million doses of vaccines and has had 1,685 vaccination teams trained to move on house to house basis to vaccinate about one million children below five years across the 226 wards of the state. The state Deputy Governor, Engr Martins Babale, who disclosed this Saturday in Yola at the official flagoff of the 2019 3rd round polio vaccination campaign, urged parents to make their children available for the anti-polio vaccination so that the state could consolidate its successful fight against polio, given that the last reported case in the state was nearly 10 years ago. He said the state had done much to rise above national immunization coverage of 72% by achieving 81% and working to raise it even further, but that the people needed to do their part by being responsive to calls for routine vaccination. “Strong routine immunization system under technical coordination of the state Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Centre are playing vital role in addressing routine immunization issues, and there is a need to sustain efforts and formulate additional strategies to ensure that all children in Adamawa State are fully vaccinated,” the deputy governor said. He thanked development partners, including World Health Organisation (WHO), EU/UNICEF, Rotary International, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Red Cross, who he said had continuously supported the government in the fight against polio and other vaccine preventable diseases.
