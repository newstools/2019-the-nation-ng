A 24-year-old undergraduate of the Olabisi Onabanjo University,  Gbenga Olukoyi has lost his life during a stampede, following a snake scare at a football viewing centre in Ibogun,  Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State. Olukoyi was among over 80 football fans at the viewing centre penultimate Tuesday to watch the UEFA Champions League match between Liverpool  and Barcelona. Tragedy struck towards the end of the match when one   of the spectators  who claimed to have sighted a snake in the hall raised the alarm. This sparked  a stampede with Olukoyi falling down in an attempt to flee. He was however trample upon by others who were also seeking an escape route. No fewer than 40 others were said to have been seriously injured in the stampede. The deceased who until his  death was a 200 level Architecture student at the university’s Engineering Campus in Ibogun- Egbeda, was taken to a hospital, where he died about 20 minutes later. An eye witness said: ‘’shortly before the end of the match, one of those at the viewing centre suddenly raised the alarm that something he suspected to be a snake had sneaked into the hall leading to a stampede during which Olukoyi was pushed down and marched on by several people who wanted to scamper into safety. ‘’It turned out that the alarm was a scare as no snake was found inside the center. Only a rope was found on the floor, which the person behind the false alarm must have passed off for a snake. ‘’He was badly injured and taken to a nearby hospital where he died a few minutes later, while several others were injured. He has since been buried.’’
