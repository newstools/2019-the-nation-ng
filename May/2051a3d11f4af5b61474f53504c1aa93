Nigeria’s foremost disc jockey, DJ Jimmy Jatt, has said that artistes encouraging cyber-crime lack home training, good education and are fraudulent. Jatt said this recently at Hangout with Jimmy Jatt and other Celebrities, an event organised by Celebrity and Fan Manager at Sheraton Hotel, Lagos. “I am the proprietor of old and new DJs in Nigeria and I have worked hard to protect my name,” he said. “I am not fraudulent and I will never encourage anyone to be involved in criminal activities. “Internet fraud is like a committing murder without the use of gun or ammunition. This is because when you dupe someone, the person you dupe may end up committing suicide or go into depression or mental disorder.” Jatt stated that many artistes want to get rich quick at all cost without remembering that they have a name to protect and that God’s time is the best. He said that it is his desire to give back to Nigerians. “I have travelled to six continents of the world,” Jatt said. “I started my career as a DJ from Obalende several decades ago at a time when parents don’t want their children to do DJ. I was rejected but today I am accepted and even honoured today by those who rejected me. We want to help young people stay in school and supported so they can live a fulfilled life.” The Chief Executive Officer of Celebrity Fan Manager, Ademola Fawaz, said that the event was to use Jimmy Jatt as the face to touch one million lives in one year by Nigerian celebrities, starting from now. The event had artistes like Funsho Adeolu, Dj Smith and Nigeria Tupac.
