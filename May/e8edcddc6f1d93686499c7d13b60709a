Nigeria started their campaign at the ICC Women’s Qualifier, Africa 2019 in Zimbabwe on a bad note as the West African team was beaten by 37runs by Rwanda at the Old Hararians Sports Club, Harare. Also, Lagos will come alive as 27 foreign participants will converge at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) Lagos to take part in the ICC Level 1 Coaching and Umpiring courses. It was a busy, and pivotal week for Africa’s women, as they will do battle for the coveted ICC Women’s World Cup and Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier slots in Harare. With host, Zimbabwe winning by 163 runs against Mozambique, Namibia beat Kenya by 39 runs while Uganda also recorded a 90runs win over Sierra Leone. Uganda are the defending champions for the women’s tournament, having memorably held off Zimbabwe in Windhoek two years ago and the hosts will be out to settle that score, and also to do well in front of their home supporters. The group winners at the end of the week will contest the final, where the winner will seal passage to the Global Qualifiers. Also, the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) will host the ICC Level 1 Coaching and Umpiring courses from today and ends on May 10. The participants from Ghana, Cameron, Sierra Leone, Mali and The Gambia will be joining their counterparts from Nigeria for the courses. According to Justine Ligyalingi , the ICC Development officer, this is the “First time such a thing is happening in the West Africa region. Nigeria Cricket Federation assured ICC she will be playing a wonderful host. Apart from the theoritical works, practical sessions will be organised to drive home the course modules.
