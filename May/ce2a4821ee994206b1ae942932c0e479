The minister urged The Gambians to take advantage of their two-week study in Nigeria to visit some states that have implemented different variations of the TSA. Also, the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), who was represented by the Director of Funds, Mr. Mohammed K.

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and National Planning of The Gambia, Madam Ada Gaye, said the delegation was in Nigeria to learn how the country managed its TSA. She said the study was part of the public finance reforms taking place in The Gambia, especially to monitor public funds.
