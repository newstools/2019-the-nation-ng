Speaking as a panelist at the event, Adesola Alli, Head of Renewable Energy Unit at Sterling Bank, noted that global industry overview of renewable energy which stood at $1.4 trillion is expected to grow to a projected value of $2.5 trillion by 2025. She added that about $531 billion investment in energy supply and technology is required yearly between now and 2050. She listed some of the industry’s major challenges as supply and demand gap, access to finance and inadequate investment as well as trust and product standardisation.
