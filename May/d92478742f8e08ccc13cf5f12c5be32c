CROSS-OVER actress, Toyin Abraham, has said that one of the secrets to making it in life is being able to face the difficulties that come one’s way. She disclosed this on Instagram during her inspirational words for the week. “Hard work and positive thinking are the most important aspects of life,” she said. “Those who believe that they can do that work actually they have courage to complete their work. Never give up, and be confident in what you do. “To earn big in life follow the right people and make your goals clear. There may be tough times, but the difficulties which you face will make you more determined to achieve your objectives and to win against all the odds.” Toyin also used the opportunity to market her business. “It is important I make this clarification,” she said. “I have two companies working with me. One, @bbbmedia, the company handles all my PR and media dealings. And Prestige Platform that is the management company that handles all my business dealings-acting, social media, corporate engagement. You can also contact (Bigsam) @officialsamolatunji1 . I appreciate all my fans for your consistency and supports but talking to fans on my behalf is not the same as talking business with me.”
