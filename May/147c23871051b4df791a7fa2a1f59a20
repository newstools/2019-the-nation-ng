The group the duo is illustrious Urhobo sons who are patriotic and committed to see to the opening up of the area. The statement explained: “We wish to states here that the Urhobo can go to war because of their patriotism so as to defend them. “At this moment the Urhobos seems to have no direction, we must appreciate one another, queue behind them to move the Urhobo Nation forward. “It is regrettable that in-fighting and pull-down syndrome amongst the Urhobo is not the political solution. At this moment of our time, we should learn from our past mistakes, take a deep breath on how to redeem the battered image that has brought the Urhobo down.” The group advised the Urhobos to tinker their focus towards what their future should be and how to achieve it, and not to rubbish one another, adding that both O’tega Emerhor and Engr. Samuel Adjogbe are gift to Urhobo nation from God. “What the entire Niger Delta region did not achieved since the inception of the Niger Delta Development Commission, the present Commission has done wonderfully beyond human expectation and imagination. “Before now, jobs were abandoned having been paid for, but today reverse has been the case. Jobs are monitored and completed and the entire Niger Delta has been opened up,” the statement added.
