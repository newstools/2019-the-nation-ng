Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has explained that his absence at the 2019 workers day celebration in Abuja has nothing to do with his current faceoff with organised labour over the headship of the board of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). The Minister who has had series of disagreement and altercation with President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba and other Labour leaders in recent times was conspicuously absent at the annual event to celebrate workers which was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. NLC President had in his address to workers alluded to the fact that the Minister was absent because of their disagreement over the NSITF board. But in a two paragraphed statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Nwachukwu Obidiwe, Senator Ngige said he was absent as a result of ill health. The statement reads: “Contrary to uncivilized attitude and barefaced lies contained in the address of the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, I wish to state for the avoidance of doubt that the Hon. Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige was absent at Wednesday’s Worker’s Day rally for reasons of ill health. “The Minister has been down with flu since last Sunday. He met his doctors last Monday and has since been at home recuperating.” The Nation gathered that workers had planned to boo the Minister at the event. His address to workers was however delivered by the Minister of state, Prof. Stephen Ocheni.
