Ondo State Police Command has said hospital workers, especially those working at the mortuary of the Ondo Specialists Hospital, Akure, will be invited in connection with the disappearance of a baby’s body from the mortuary. Police spokesman Femi Joseph, a Superintendent of Police (SP), said investigation had begun on the incident. It was learnt that the newborn baby and his mother were brought dead to the hospital from the police hospital, Akure and their remains were deposited at the mortuary last Wednesday. The mother and the baby reportedly died during labour. But the bereaved family, on getting to the hospital last Saturday to take the bodies for burial, saw only the remains of the mother. A source said: “When the family got to the mortuary today (Saturday) to collect the bodies, they only saw that of the mother and the placenta. They could not find the baby. The mortuary attendants could not explain what happened.” The bereaved family was said to have almost caused crisis on the hospital premises following the incident. But they were said to have reported the matter at a police station. Joseph said: “We have not made any arrest, but we have begun investigation. We will invite the hospital workers, especially those working at the mortuary.” Health Commissioner Dr. Wahab Adegbenro said the matter had been handed over to the police command for investigation.
