THE Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday in Abakaliki said it was stepping up its fight against cyber crimes and internet fraudsters in the country. Its Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau (CAB), Mrs. Felicia Onwuegbuchulam,  who spoke in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital during 105th edition of consumer outreach programme of the Commission, expressed worry that the activities of these criminals were on the increase in the country with dire consequences on the populace. The outreach themee was: Mitigating Effects of Cybercrimes: The  Role of Telecom Consumers. According to her, many people have lost their lives, monies, personal identity and privacies to cyber criminals which has made the Commission to adopt measures to curtail their activities. Mrs Onwuegbuchulam said the Commission was partnering with security agents, National Security Adviser and other relevant stakeholders to tackle the menace. She said: “Cyber crime gives big concern to the commission; people lose their money, people lose their personal identity; people lose their privacies and in the process, they are either duped or even harmed or killed. “The war against cyber crime may not have been won but we are doing everything humanly possible to stem the tide, it is an ongoing thing. As they are coming up, you are dressing them and new ones are coming up.
