The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is training 96,000 farmers on financial literacy and inclusion. This is to inculcate on them savings culture. The Niger State Coordinator, IFAD Value Chain Development Program (VCDP),  Dr. Mathew Ahmed, made this known at the stakeholders’ workshop on financial literacy for IFAD VCDP workers and lead farmers in Bida. According to him, farmers do not keep records of their transactions, which have made it difficult for them to assess finance, adding that their inability to practise the cashless policy makes them possible victims for robbers and bandits. He said the training would also take place in two places, Makurdi and Abakaliki. “Although we are training the lead farmers, these farmers will go down to their groups and clusters to train their members,” the coordinator said. A German financial consultant, Dr. Michael Marx, who conducted the training, stressed the need for farmers to save, adding that the culture should be encouraged. “Without the esusu, ajo and other indigenous savings and credit contributions, the country would have been dead. Their benefits are immense. Indigenous savings is one of the best economic options the country need to look at and should not be overlooked,” Marx said “We are convinced that the training will help them enhance their incomes. We want all 5,000 farming groups being supported by the IFAD VCDP to have their own internal savings schemes, practice internal savings and credit, set aside funds for depreciation and learn to be wise borrowers,” Marx said. The VCDP Rural Institution, Gender and Rural Development Officer, Musa Dalung said it was important for farmers to know how to calculate interest rates and depreciation of their equipment. “IFAD has capacitated, empowered and supported these farmers with inputs, equipment and infrastructures but they will need to know how to maintain these things, how they can save and generate money,” he said.
