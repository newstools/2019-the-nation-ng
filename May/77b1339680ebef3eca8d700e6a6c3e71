To ensure safety on its inland waterways, the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), on Thursday, distributed 1,000 life-jackets to boat operators operating along the Ojo and Badagry corridor. The Managing Director, LASWA, Damilola Emmanuel, said about 300 of the 1,000 life-jackets dished out were for children. According to him, it was deliberately done as his agency wants better safety for school children who commute on water. He added that another reason life-jackets for children were procured was because boat operators do not have life-jacket for children. Emmanuel said, that, LASWAâ€™s donation to operators and passengers is part of its efforts to promote safety on water, hence boat operators should not hoard or sell them. He called for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to ensure that the waterways are safe and attract better patronage. Responding to the LASWA boss gesture, the Chairman of the Association of Tourist Boat Operators and Water Transport of Nigeria (ATBOWATON), Lagos State chapter, Babatunde Saheed, commended LASWA for supporting the operators, and implored his colleagues to deploy the lifejackets for actual use by passengers.
