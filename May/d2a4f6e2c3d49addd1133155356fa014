EXECUTIVE Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Services, FIRS, Dr Babatunde Fowler, has commended the film, ‘Knockout.’ Fowler said this when the management of Wale Adenuga Productions hosted him to a private screening of the movie at Genesis Deluxe Cinemas Lekki, Lagos. News of a boxing competition with a cash prize of  N1 billion  ($3m) hits the town and sends a group of people into a hilarious frenzy, as they devise mischievous means to participate. The clumsy boxer they choose and the crazy characters they meet along the way result in a myriad of mayhem and madness. “It’s a very interesting movie which shows the talents we have in Nigeria,” Dr Babatunde Fowler said. “When people think about movies, their minds go to the foreign movies, but this is certainly a first-class movie and I think it would be acceptable and watched all over the world. The movie which was released into the cinemas on Easter Friday featured Sola Sobowale, Hafeez “Saka” Oyetoro, Patience Ozokwor, Chiwetalu Agu, Toyin Abraham, Odunlade Adekola, Desmond Elliot, Ngozi Nwosu and Yaw. Others are Funky Mallam, Charles Okocha, Josh2funny, Akpan & Oduma, MC Lively and Princess among others. Wale Adenuga praised the FIRS boss’ work and support for the entertainment sector. “I am greatly impressed by the unprecedented performance of FIRS under Dr Babatunde Fowler,” said Adenuga. “He has contributed immensely in revenue generation for the provision of amenities and the overall betterment of the country. He has also been very supportive of the Nigerian entertainment industry thus creating jobs for millions of our youths and turning their dreams into reality.”
