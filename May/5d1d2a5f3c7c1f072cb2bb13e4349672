We are convinced that Mike will bring Qatar Re’s ongoing transition to a business model based on lower volatility and more reliable profitability to a successful conclusion.” Michael van der Straaten, CEO of Qatar Re, commented: “I am excited to take the helm at Qatar Re at a time when our company is increasingly generating its own business from market segments that we understand thoroughly. We embarked on this course more than two years ago and are starting to reap the benefits. Our expertise in these areas is obviously a major boon for us against the backdrop of stubbornly tough trading conditions in global (re)insurance.
