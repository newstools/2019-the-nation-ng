Miss Toluhi Oreoluwa will be meeting with the children of Queen Model School, Enugu, tomorrow as part of the programmes spearheaded by the Queen Moremi Ajasoro Initiatives. Oreoluwa is the current Queen Moremi Beauty Pageant, an initiative of the Ooni of Ife,Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The book reading programme is part of the many events to reach out to primary and secondary school children to teach them the tenets of selfless service to mankind. Oreoluwa who will be in company of Princess Ademuluyi, the Queen Moremi Ambassador, told The Nation that she will be reading from a book titled The Legendary Queen Moremi Ajasoro. “It is to inculcate in the children the values of courage, boldness and love for one another. It is also part of His Majesty’s efforts to extend hands of love and unity and friendship across Nigeria. From Enugu, we will move up north with the same gospel and we will intersperse the reading with soft music so that it will not be boring”.
