Eden Hazard suggested he had played his final game for Chelsea after his two goals helped the club win the Europa League. “We will decide in a few days and the only target in my mind tonight was to win this final. I have made my decision already and now I’m waiting on both clubs,” said the Chelsea ace. “I think it is a goodbye, but in football you never know. My dream was to play in the Premier League and I have done that for one of the biggest clubs so maybe now it is the time for a new challenge.” The Belgian has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid.
