Four persons – three men and a woman – were yesterday killed when an Abule Egba-bound train crushed a tricycle at Iju Ishaga, a Lagos suburb. It was learnt that the tricycle, with four passengers and the driver, had attempted to quickly cross the rail at Oke Aro when it got trapped around 6.45am. It was learnt that motorists and passersby  stopped when they sighted the train from afar, but the tricyclist thought he could pass before the train got close. One of the occupants, The Nation gathered, escaped unhurt. The remains of the deceased littered the scene. Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) General Manager (GM) Adesina Tiamiyu said findings showed that the accident was caused by the  tricyclist’s recklessness. The agency, he said, received a distress call around 6:52am and activated its emergency response team. He said: “On arrival on the scene, it was gathered that a tricycle with five people inside, had a collision with a moving train. “We learnt that the accident was caused by the tricyclist’s recklessness, as he attempted to cross the rail while a train was coming. “Unfortunately four persons- three men and one woman died. One man, however, escaped unhurt. “The agency’s response team and other stakeholders, including the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC), Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS), Nigeria Police Force (NPF) and the State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (SEHMU) rushed to the scene. “The bodies were recovered and handed over to SEHMU, to be moved to the mortuary. Motorists and tricyclists are advised to be patient when crossing the rail, to avoid loss of lives.”
