former Big Brother Naija housemate, Cynthia Nwadiora, popularly known as Cee-C, who launched her gym wear, Cegar, on Sunday at Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, said the design came out of passion for being the CEO of fitness. Cee-C who was styled by Tiannah’s Empire said Cegar is officially launched and ready to take orders. “We’re dedicated to giving you the very best with a focus on affordability, customer service and uniqueness,” she said. “The birth of Cegar came from the passion of the CEO for fitness. The lack of easy accessibility to quality fitness wears birthed Cegar. “For many people like me, exercising not only serves as a means to keep our bodies healthy but also as an outlet to de-stress from life’s struggles and keep our minds healthy. Cegar is a fitness lifestyle brand that I created out of a personal need to promote both physical and mental wellness while making apparel more accessible and stylish. I believe looking good is the first step to feeling good so I have handpicked these pieces (most of which are my personal designs) and I’m hoping you will love them as much as i do .Most importantly I hope that these pieces serve as a reminder of my wish for you; that when in life……. Or if the gym gets tough, you get resilient.”
