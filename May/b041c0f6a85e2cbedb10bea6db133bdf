rapper Falz has announced he’s hosting the second edition of his concert, ‘The Falz Experience’ at Eko Convention Center, Victoria Island, Lagos on June 8, 2019. The five-hour live concert which will be produced by Livespot productions will feature performances by Falz and artistes like Simi, Ycee and others. With early bird tickets already sold out, it is expected that the show will surpass the record-breaking 100 million views recording by the debut edition in 2017. The maiden edition of the show reportedly gulped a whooping sum of N300 million and elevated the concert experience in Nigeria. Also, fans will be able to suggest ideas to the two-time AMVCA winner about what they would like to see at the show with the hashtag #WhatWillFalzDo. From the songs they’d like to hear and even which version of Falz they would like to see, Falz is putting the power in the hands of the fans to help him create an engaging concert like no other. Speaking on why he’s putting the fans at the centre of this edition, Falz said: “My fans are the core of my career. I am nothing without their love and support and that’s why I’m putting the Falz Experience together, just for them. I would love to get ideas and comments from them on how we can make The Falz Experience bigger and better. The idea behind The Falz Experience 2 is to bring all their thoughts together to build a fantastic show. It’s a music concert that will incorporate different elements of my art, with support from the many colleagues I have collaborated with and of course, my fans.”
