•Counter-sues for damages Two years after a long legal tussle, popular Nollywood actress, Omoni Oboli has won a case of copyright filed against her by Jude Idada and Chioma Onyekwe of Raconteur Productions. It will be recalled that Jude Idada and Chioma Onyekwe of Raconteur Productions got an interlocutory injunction from the Federal High Court preventing Filmone and Dioni Visions from showing the movie, Okafor’s Law.  The judgement led to the premiere being cancelled on March 24, 2017. But on May 2, 2019, Honourable Justice Buba of the Federal High Court, (Lagos Division) said the plaintiff failed to adduce sufficient and credible evidence to prove ownership and authorship of the screenplay and the script of the feature film, Okafor’s Law, Law thereby the case was dismissed. Omoni who had earlier counter-sued the plaintiff is determined to pursue the case to a logical conclusion.
