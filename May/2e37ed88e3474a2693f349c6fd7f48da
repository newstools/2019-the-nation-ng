Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is hopeful that his goal against Valencia would be ‘important’ in their quest to win the Europa League. On Thursday, Unai Emery’s men weathered the storm to secure a 3-1 victory over their Spanish visitors in the first leg of their semi-final clash at the Emirates. Mouctar Diakhaby handed the Spanish side an early lead but the Gunners fought back with Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette scoring. Lacazette put the Gunners ahead before Aubameyang handed the hosts a solid first leg advantage with his late effort. “Yeah, I think that goal will hopefully be important,” Aubameyang told BT Sport. “We started the game not so good, but we had a good reaction after that and I think today we played very well to win this game. “We started the game a bit nervous because we lost the last three games, and that’s normal because we’re human, but after that we had a good reaction. “We have a lot quality in this group and we can get to the final, but we know the next game will be difficult. If we do the same ingredients there, we will go through. “I think it’s our target to reach the final and win this trophy because we know it’s an opportunity to qualify for next year’s Champions League. Last year we stopped at the semi-finals and I think now we have learnt a lot from last year’s errors and hopefully this year we will not do the same.” The goal was Aubameyang’s 25th of the season and before they travel to Spainfor the reverse fixture of the Europa League semi-final, he will hope to help Arsenal secure a crucial victory against Brighton and Hove Albion in their penultimate Premier League game of the season on Sunday.
