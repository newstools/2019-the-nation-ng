Head Coach of the Super Falcons, Thomas Dennerby has assured that the African champions will not suffer any mental block when confronting European opposition at the FIFA World Cup finals in France. Speaking during a press conference preceding the WAFU Women’s Tournament starting in Abidjan next week, Dennerby said he believes the Super Falcons have now gained enough confidence to stand their ground against European, American and Asian opposition any time the need arises. “The team now has the confidence to play against any team, whichever continent they come from. That is the benefit of the several training camps and friendly tournaments we have had this year. I definitely don’t think that it’s some kind of mental block when we lost to Canada in Spain. We know the reason why we lost the game and the biggest lessons are not to do tactics that the team has not practised in training, and also to stop playing only when the referee’s whistle goes for the end of the game.
