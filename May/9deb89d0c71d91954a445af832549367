MultiChoice has announced call for entry for the second edition of the MultiChoice Talent Factory Academy (MTF) programme. The talent factory academy was launched in May 2018 as part of MultiChoice Africa’s corporate shared value (CSV) initiative to ignite Africa’s creative industry through TV and film-making. The programme is open to candidates with industry experience or a relevant post-school qualification in film-making to hone their television and film production skills under the guidance and mentorship of industry experts. Only 60 students will be selected to be part of the much sought-after year-long and fully-funded programme at three academy hubs in Southern Africa (Lusaka, Zambia), East Africa (Nairobi, Kenya) and West Africa (Lagos, Nigeria), headed by industry leaders Berry Lwando, Njoki Muhoho and Femi Odugbemi. As part of the programme, young film-makers are provided with training and hands-on experience in the film industry, with a focus on storytelling, production, audio and directing and other key areas. The academies also provide students with an opportunity to learn directly from well-known leading industry experts, work on live sets of local TV productions and create original content that will be aired on various local M-Net channels across the MultiChoice platforms– DStv, GOtv and Showmax.
