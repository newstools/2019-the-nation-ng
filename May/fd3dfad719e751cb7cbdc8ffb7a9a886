Zainab Aliyu, a Nigerian student who was detained in Saudi Arabia for alleged drug trafficking, has on Monday arrived in Nigeria after four months in detention. Aliyu, a 22-year-old student of the Maitama Sule University in Kano, had travelled to Saudi Arabia for lesser hajj alongside her mother and sister. She was arrested at the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport in Medina, Saudi Arabia in December 2018 after tramadol, a banned drug was allegedly found in her bag. She, however, arrived in Nigeria through the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano on Monday in the company of Ibrahim Abubakar, another Nigerian accused of the same crime. She was released to the Nigerian mission in Saudi Arabia after the federal government made efforts to investigate and establish her innocence.
