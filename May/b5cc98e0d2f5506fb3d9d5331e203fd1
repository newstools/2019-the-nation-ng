Barely two months after declaring his intention to contest for the November 16, Kogi State governorship election on the platform of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), speculations are rife that the son of the late strongman of Kogi politics, Prince Abubakar Audu, Mona Mustapha Audu may dump the party and return to his former party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The late Audu was the governorship standard bearer of the party during the 2015 race. Mustapha Audu’s recent visit to the presidency is said not to be unconnected with reports that his romance with the YPP may be coming to an end. Some political pundits in both Abuja, the seat of power and Kogi, have however posited that such a move will amount to a betrayal of the YPP, which not long ago gave him the ticket to contest the forthcoming Kogi governorship election. The late Audu’s son who ended a charity outreach programme during the week, was reportedly spotted in Abuja, with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustafa and Hon. Gidado Samani, Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters. Unconfirmed reports have it that there are moves by the presidency to compensate the loss of his father, who died shortly, while on his way to winning the November 21, 2015 Kogi governorship election. Since declaring for the YPP over a month ago, the late Audu’s son has been under pressure from members of his family and Kogi APC elders, to return to the ruling party. Why the date for his return to the APC remains unknown, a source close to the family said, “it will happen in a matter of days.”
