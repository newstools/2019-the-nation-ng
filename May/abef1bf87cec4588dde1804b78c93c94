Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board(NCDMB) has been advised to limit its expenditure on indigenous firms, infrastructure development, capacity building and research and development to 80 per cent. A non-profit organisation, The Borderless, which gave the advice, said the balance  could be spent on investments and in other areas unrelated to local content development. According to a report by The Borderless, a not-for-profit organisation that monitors local content compliance and implementation in the country, the NCDMB is urged to also improve on its regulatory duty of effectivemonitoring and enforcing compliance by operators, both foreign andindigenous companies. According to the report, “NCDMB should be more above to its regulatoryduty of effectively monitoring and enforcing compliance by operators.The NOGIC Act should be amended to set a limit on amount of theNigerian Content Fund (NCF) spent by the Board on its operations. “There must be express stipulation that at least 80 per cent of theNCF is to be expended on Nigerian indigenous companies, infrastructuredevelopment, capacity building and research and development. “There must be express provision setting out the definition of aNigerian Indigenous Company and there must be a review of timeline onministerial waivers to reflect realities.” The Borderless also called for greater capacity building of the organised civil society on local content issues for greater public awareness and a more robust oversight regime by National Assembly to ensure better monitoring by NCDMB. “Greater synergy between National Assembly and the organised civil society for more robust oversight regime, amendment of the NOGIC Actand increased public awareness,” it stated.
