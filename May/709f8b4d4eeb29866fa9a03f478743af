Authorities of the Kwara state University (KWASU), Malete Moro local government are Thursday announced the closure of the institution. The closure of KWASU was as a result of protest by students of the school over Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed’s appointment of acting Vice Chancellor Prof Kenneth Adeyemi for the institution. Tenure of the current Vice Chancellor of the school, Prof Abdulrasheed Na’Allah expires July this year. In a statement Deputy Vice Chancellor (Administration) Prof Sakah Mahmud said “because of recent developments in our state and in the university and our students’ reactions to the government’s appointment of an acting vice chancellor in which the students gave a 24 hour ultimatum to government, the university management (and three university members of the governing council) met Thursday, Wednesday, 8 May, 2019 and decided to temporarily close the university until further notice as a preventive measure against any possible disturbances. “I want to re-emphasize that this measure is to ensure the security of our great campus. I am in touch with the Pro-Chancellor and Council Chairman, and he indicates total support that closing the campus at this time is desirable. Thank God that exams have been completed and gradings are still ongoing, with some lecturers already uploading their grades. “Staff and students should leave the University quietly and ensure the safety of property and life. Reports reaching me indicates that a contingence of police (in vehicles belonging to KWIRS) were being driven towards the campus and it took some intervention to get them to return to Ilorin. KWASU does not want any situation in which the ongoing temporary crisis which would be safely and easily resolved by the grace of God lead into the loss of any life. “Please take your luggage and other personal properties and go home safely until further notice. Please this decision goes into effect immediately.”
