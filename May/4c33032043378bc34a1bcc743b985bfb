AFRO-JUJU creator, Sir Shina Peters, has claimed to be the first Yoruba hip-hop artiste in Nigeria. The veteran musician, while thrilling the crowd at the recent edition of gidifest held at the Landmark beach-front, Victoria Island, Lagos, switched to classic tunes. ‘Omoge loke loke, loke loke,’ he started chorusing at a stage in his performance. Not to let the audience feel he is copying the songstress, Teniola, Sir Peters paused to say he is the first artiste to rap in Yoruba. “Since 1990, some of you dey never born,” he said. “I am the first hip hop artiste. And I am the first artiste to rap in Yoruba in Nigeria, 1992 to be precise. You no remember again because una dey dance everything now. “We that cook the soup, you don forget us. Anyway, you no forget me sha. You guys are the best in the world,” he commended the crowd. With his energetic performance, he revived the audience of heydays with his evergreen songs, as they also groove along with him. Born Oluwashina Akanbi Peters in Ogun State, Peters’ career in music began at a young age. He blended his sound with juju and Afrobeat, combining fast percussive beats, electronic keyboards, saxophone and guitar. He has recorded 16 albums including’ Ace’ and ‘Shinamania’, which had singles such as ‘Oluwa Yo Pese’, ‘Omo Bo’ and ‘Give Our Women Chance’. Sir Shina Peters has won several local and international awards.
