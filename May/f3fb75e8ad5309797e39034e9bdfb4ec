The Senate on Thursday threw out a bill seeking the establishment of Maritime University of Lokoja. The bill sponsored by Senator Isaac Mohammed Alfa (Kogi East) sought an Act to establish the Maritime University of Nigeria, Lokoja to make provisions for the due management and administration and other related matters, 2019. In his lead debate in support of the proposed university, Alfa detailed reasons why the establishment of the specialised university is necessary especially in the coastal town of Lokoja. Alfa’s reasons in support of the proposed university did not however persuade his colleagues to support the bill. Senate Chief Whip, Senator Olusola Adeyeye, was frontal in his attack on the bill. The Osun Central lawmaker said that he would continue to oppose the creation of new universities until existing ones were adequately funded. He noted that it was open knowledge that existing state and federal universities were being neglected in terms of funding. Senator Adamu Aliero (Kebbi Central) also opposed the bill. He noted that as important as the bill may be, existing universities could take care of the proposed Maritime University. Sensing that the bill was heading to be killed, Senate Minority Leader, Senator Biodun Olujimi, suggested that the sponsor should withdraw it for further consultation. Senate President, Bukola Saraki put Olujimi’s suggestion to Alfa for consideration and possible withdrawal of the bill. The Kogi East senator rejected the suggestion. Alfa noted that the bill was a well thought out proposed legislation for the creation of the university. He added that a lot of consultations were made before the drafting of the bill. Alfa insisted that it was difficult for him to withdraw the bill especially in the light of the enormous effort made to package it. Saraki promptly put the bill to vote and it was defeated.
