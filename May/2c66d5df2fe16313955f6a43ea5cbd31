FOLLOWING the April 19 release of her ‘Omo Charlie Champagne’ album and expiration of her recording contract, Simi and X3M music have called it quits. X3M Music announced the departure of Simi following the expiration of her recording contract in a statement signed by A&R executive Vincent Nwanze, that both parties have determined to not renew the contract. Signed to X3M in 2014, Simi warmed the hearts of many music lovers with the hit single ‘Tiff’ which earned her a Headies nomination. Her debut album for X3M (her career second) was released to local and international acclaim in September 2017, and named album of the year in 2018, by the Headies Awards. “We only sign artistes that we love and believe in,” X3M Music’s management said. “We know our taste in music is rather different; but we only sign talents who meet that taste. Fortunately, we have been able to find millions of music lovers here and abroad, who share similar tastes, as is evident in the success of all the artistes we have worked with, including Simi who is without any doubt one of the biggest music talents in the country today.” X3M Music, part of the X3M group, was founded in 2008 by Steve Babaeko, an advertising executive who is a music fan and enthusiast, and internationally-acclaimed writer.
