The police in Ogun State have arrested four suspected cultists for alleged murder of a 26-year-old man, Saibu Azeez, last Friday. The suspects, Opeyemi Olalekan, Azeez Ologundudu, Emmanuel Omoboriowo and Anigilaje Babatunde were alleged to have stormed a birthday party at 34, Oyedele Close, Abule Lemode, Ijoko around 2am and stabbed the deceased in the stomach. They also stabbed another man in the head. It was gathered that the party was organised by Oluwatoye Ogun at his father’s house and the suspects, in a bid to get Azeez, allegedly stabbed Ogun’s father in the head. The suspected cultists were alleged to have attacked other people at the party with broken bottles, just to get Azeez, suspected to be a rival cult member. Those who sustained injuries, including Azeez, were said to have been taken to hospital, but Azeez later died. Confirming the incident, spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said policemen from Agbado led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Aloko Amodu, responded to a distress call from the party venue. He said investigation showed that Azeez was a suspected member of a rival cult and those who attacked him were on a likely reprisal. “The suspects have confessed to be members of a rival cult. The body has been deposited at a morgue for autopsy. “Police Commissioner Bashir Makama has ordered the transfer of the suspects to the homicide section for discreet investigation. He reiterated his earlier stance against cultism and vowed not to rest until the vice was eradicated,” said Oyeyemi.
