Proceedings at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) has been halted owing to request by Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), lawyer to the petitioners – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Atiku Abubakar. The court had scheduled pre-hearing session in the petition for Wednesday, but when the case was mentioned a little after 10am, Uzoukwu told the five-man panel tribunal, that he has an application, which he would prefer to move in chambers. He sought the understanding of other lawyer in the case, following which it was agreed that the tribunal suspends sitting and listen to the issues the lawyer to the PDP and Atiku wishes to raise. Following agreement by the lawyers that each party be represented, in the chamber meeting, by three lawyers each, tribunal’s Chairman and President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa stood down proceedings, to resume later. The audience, made up of politicians, lawyers and journalists, are currently awaiting the resumption of proceedings.
