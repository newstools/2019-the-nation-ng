Super Eagles full-back, Ola Aina wrapped up his loan deal with Torino in style as he picked up the man of the match award in their 3-1 home win over Lazio, AOIFootball.com reports. Playing in what could potentially be his last game at the Stadio Olimpico, the on-loan Chelsea wing-back started his 22nd league game of the season as Torino hoped for a final day miracle to clinch a Europa League spot. After a goalless first 45 minutes, the host took the lead six minutes into the second half when a powerful long throw from the Nigerian flew past everyone in the box before reaching the legs of forward Iago Falque who fired home for 1-0. Serbian midfielder Saša Lukic doubled Torino’s lead two minutes later before Ciro Immobile reduced the deficit six minutes after the hour mark to make it 2-1.
