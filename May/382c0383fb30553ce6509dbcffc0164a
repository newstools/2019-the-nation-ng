AFTER a 10-day private visit to the United Kingdom (UK), President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday returned to Abuja. His plane touched down at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 6:24pm. A statement by his spokesperson Femi Adesina, said some “reckless online media, irresponsible political opposition, and other bilious groups and individuals, had gone on overdrive since the President left the country on April 25, insinuating that he was going for hospitalisation, and would not return after 10 days as stated. “In their vain imaginations, they even stated that fictive doctors have advised President Buhari to stay longer for more intensive care. “Now that the President has returned, can these apostles of evil imaginings swallow their words? Can they retract their tendentious stories as well as press statements, and apologize to millions of Nigerians both at home and in the Diaspora that they have fed with hogwash? “Few days after the celebration of World Press Freedom Day, we daresay that this valuable freedom does not tantamount to liberty to mislead and hoodwink the populace through concocted and jejune publications. “The Buhari administration will always respect and uphold press freedom, but the onus lies on those prone to passing off fiction as facts, to remember that freedom demands concomitant responsibility. “Those who further share and disseminate falsehood are also encouraged to embrace responsible conduct.”
