Nigeria’s U-20 boys, Flying Eagles have landed in Poland for this year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup after rounding off a three-week residential training at Bad Gogging on the outskirts of Munich, Germany on Saturday. The team flew out of Germany via Munich on Sunday morning for the final leg of preparation for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup that begins on 23rd May. While in Bad Grogging, the team played four friendly games (a 3-3 draw with Freiburg U-19s; a 1-2 loss to Saudi Arabia U-20s; a 3-1 win over AFR Aelen and; a 1-1 draw with Red Bull Salzburg) as they seek to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time. Two-time runners at the competition, in 1989 and 2005, Nigeria took the bronze medal at the 1985 finals staged in the former Soviet Union. Team captain Ikouwem Udoh Utin told thenff.com that the camping exercise in Germany has helped the team blend very well. “Our time in Germany has really helped us to come together as a group, blend with one another as well as learn new things from our coaches,” Utin enthused. “It has been a wonderful experience here in camp. The boys now understand one another better and we have perfected our plans as we go into the tournament. We want to make Nigeria proud in Poland and we will do our best not to disappoint Nigerians. Our aim is to go all out and win the trophy for Nigeria. We also want to thank the NFF and Nigerians for their support and we will go there and represent Nigeria well.” IK Sirius of Sweden striker, Henry Offia is also optimistic that the team will go far in Poland 2019 and the lessons learned in camp will go a long way to help actualise this aim. “I’m really happy and grateful to be part of this team. This is my first time with any of the national teams and I’ll do my best not to disappoint,” Offia stated.
