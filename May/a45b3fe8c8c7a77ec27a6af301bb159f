Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has revealed that Naby Keita has a high-grade adductor injury and will be out for two months and as such, is a huge doubt for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. “It was really unlucky. Bad news. High-grade adductor injury. The tendon is ruptured. Will keep him out for at least 2 months,” Klopp told the media in Europe. “Bad news for us and for Guinea with the Africa Cup of Nations coming up. Not nice.” The news comes as a huge blow to Afcon-bound Guinea. Injuries and inconsistency had stunted the growth of the midfielder at the Anfield outfit, having arrived in the summer as a £59 million ($62m) signing. Asked about how Keita is taking the news of his recent injury on board, Klopp added: “For sure he’s not in the best moment but it’s okay I think.
