Ogun State Ministry of Forestry has re-affirmed its commitment to preserve its forest resources. Its Permanent Secretary, Mr. Dolapo Adewunmi, gave the assurance after a stakeholders’ meeting with officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, led by the Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Abosede Ogunleye and the Cocoa Association of Nigeria, Area J4 Forest Reserve. Adewunmi said in line with the 2004 agreement between government and cocoa farmers in its forest reserves, the ministry is empowered to protect its reserves and resources against deforestation. These include: extension of farm-land beyond allocated areas  and destruction of government trees for cocoa planting, among others. He explained that the position of the government on cocoa farmers and the people residing within the forest reserves had not changed, adding that the two ministries had agreed to set up a committee to monitor compliance. ‘’The ministry has the responsibility to protect and develop its forest reserves; cocoa farmers operating within the reserves must respect the agreement and comply with all rules and regulations.There will be no further planting of new cocoa, expansion of farm lands beyond allocated areas or destruction of government trees,’’ he said. Mrs. Ogunleye advised stakeholders to stop planting new cocoa and keep to the agreement.
