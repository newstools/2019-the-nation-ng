Don’t let the rains dull your sense of style! Now, this is a season that will not go away in a hurry. Covering up most parts of your body is what you need to do in this cold season. No piece of wear does this well than sweater. And when you are thinking in terms of the sweater to wear, it doesn’t have to be the normal, swollen pullover or close-fitting knotted jackets with or without sleeves. You can combine a good jacket and a stylish sweater with either skirt or pants (trousers) under.  And these can be worn by both sexes. Men are not left out; brighten up with stylish turtleneck and V-neck sweaters. Neckline trends come and go like weather, but a turtleneck sweater has earned its place as a classic come rain or sunshine. Go for long-fitted hand length tops. Search through your wardrobe, you will certainly get a few things to work on. That way, you won’t have to look dull. Gone are the days of wearing sweaters on formal wear. Some sweaters are now being worn as main wear. Remember, the most important thing is that you must make a fashion statement despite the showery; you do not have to look dull.
