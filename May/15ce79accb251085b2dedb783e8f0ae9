Non-alcoholic beverage giant, Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) Limited has commenced its 2019 series of the ‘Youth Empowered’ initiative, aimed at equipping youths with basic life and business skills at a 3-day workshop held in Abeokuta. The initiative which received commendation from the Ogun State Government for tackling youth unemployment in the country, witnessed a large turnout of over 750 registered participants. Earlier in his opening remarks at the 3-day workshop, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth Development and Sports, Ogun State who was represented by the Director, Employment Generation of the Ministry, Mr. Abdulhakeem Ashimi described the initiative as highly commendable, well thought-out and complementary to government’s effort in reducing unemployment through its numerous programs for the youth. “The problem of persistent youth unemployment requires combined efforts of the public and private sectors for any meaningful and sustainable impact to be achieved. We believe government alone should not be left to tackle the issue of unemployment in Nigeria, the private sector has a big role to play,” he said.
