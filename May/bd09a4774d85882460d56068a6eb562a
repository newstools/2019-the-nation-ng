BJ Sam, who has just released the long awaited music video of his single, ‘Will You Marry Me?’, has said that couples have been requesting his new sound at weddings. According to the artiste, the music video will break boundaries. “New music is released every day but this one is exceptionally beautiful,” he said. “Will You Marry Me? is an international fresh tune from a splendid blend of Caribbean Zouk Music, R&B and African rhythm. I am 100% sure that you wouldn’t be able to get the song out of your head and playlist all through this year and beyond. Many couples has been requesting for the song to be played at their wedding ceremonies.” BJ Sam is a writer and recording artist who sings in English and French.
