Nollywood actress and producer, Funke Akindele-Bello, recently launched a Handwash station at the popular Ojuwoye Market, Mushin, Lagos, on May 13th, 2019, as part of Dettol’s activities to mark the World Hand Hygiene Day. The actress who is the brand ambassador of Dettol’s Clean Naija called on the traders at Ojuwoye market, to cultivate the habit of washing their hands thoroughly, especially since they “touch the edible elements that go into homes and makeup what the whole family would eventually eat”. Women and mothers who make up the larger percentage of the foot traffic at Ojuwoye market as buyers and traders were educated on the importance of raising their wards to understand the need for meticulous hand washing. Also present at the launch was Alhaja Mufuliat A. Adebunmi, the Iya Oloja, Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye, she expressed her enthusiasm for the commissioned hand wash site because it marked the beginning of a healthier community. The World Hand Hygiene Day is a global movement championed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which, just like the Clean Naija initiative, advocates for better health and hygiene for all. The ultimate goal is to pass the message that regardless of age, ethnicity or socio-economical status, everyone can stay happier and healthier just by cultivating the simple habit of thorough hand washing. RB Nigeria, through its Dettol brand, already has a number of programs committed to educating Nigerians on better health practices. They include: The School Hygiene Program, through which RB has educated over seven million children on proper hand hygiene habits over the past 7 years, and the New Mum’s Program, through which RB has educated over five million pregnant and new mothers on hygienic practices to protect them during the pre- and post- phases of their pregnancies
