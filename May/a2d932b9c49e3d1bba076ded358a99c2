The Lagos State Government has created a Senior Citizens Help Centre to ease the pains of elders with lingering landlords’ and tenants’ cases in courts. The state Chief Judge, Justice Opeyemi Oke, at the centre’s inauguration at the Justice J. I. C. Taylor Court House in Igbosere, Lagos, yesterday, said  it would cater for elders’ cases that have lingered for three to five years. She said: “We have to consider elderly people in the society. The major reason that brought about the idea of the centre is the landlord and tenant cases that have stayed so long at the courts. “We want to bring an end to the cases of landlord and tenant lasting three to five years in courts. Most of these landlords are retirees who depend so much on the rent they earn from letting their premises out and if a tenant does not pay, that’s hardship for the property owners. “The senior citizens can walk into the centre and fill the particulars of their cases such as the year they were filed, the suit numbers, names of magistrates or judges and names of lawyers appearing in the matter and the case file will be reassigned to another diligent judge or magistrate.” The judge added that the centre will help the judiciary in blocking loopholes lawyers exploit to stall trials. She reiterated the government’s decision to make the state a smart city, noting that the judiciary was working towards achieving the goal.
