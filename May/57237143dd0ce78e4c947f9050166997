Physical Planning and Urban Development Commissioner Prince Rotimi Ogunleye said yesterday at a stakeholders’ meeting in the community that those whose buildings are demolished would be compensated. He said the project would add  to the community’s aesthetic value. Represented by a director in the ministry, Bola Aliu, Ogunleye said: “This project will improve the rental and capital value, reduce travel time, improve connectivity index, reduce psychological stress and improve the level of socio-cultural interaction and evolution.” He urged residents to cooperate with the government to actualise the project , saying : “We enjoin you to bear with us because of the inconveniences to be experienced. The project will be completed without delay and with your cooperation. The government is ready to do more with your continued support’’. When completed, he said,  the  roads would improve connectivity with Oko Oba GRA Scheme 1, Oko Oba Agege, on Old Abeokuta Road and enhance residents’ standard of living.
