Ahead of the CAF Champions League final, Super Eagles duo players Babatunde Michael and Gabriel Okechukwu, are very optimistic of victory against Espérance de Tunis in the first leg to be played in Morocco on Friday. Wydad Casablanca of Morocco will be out for revenge against Esperance of Tunisia having met first in 2011 CAF Champions League final which the Tunisians won 1-0 on aggregate. On the roads to this year’s final, both sides secured 0-0 draws away from home in the second leg of their semi-finals. Esperance took a 1-0 lead to the Democratic Republic of Congo where TP Mazembe failed to overturn the deficit while Wydad went through against South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns courtesy of a 2-1 win in Morocco. “We’re not going to underrate them, they are very technical with pace,” said Okechukwu. “We are good to face them, we believe in hard work, we believe in ourselves and we are not going to be intimidated at all cost. The history is going to favour us at this point and we are very optimistic.” Babatunde, who has been a weapon of destruction for the team this season said: “We are motivated to take lead to Tunisia. Of course, we are expecting the toughest match of the season against Esperance, they have good record of the Champions League and we must be discipline enough to assure ourselves a victory, and that is what the fans want from us.” He added: “Hard work has taken us to this level, and we need to do more to get over the Esperance, we urge our fans for maximum supports, and with them we are going to rewrite history, it is not time to revenge, we only want to win the trophy.”
