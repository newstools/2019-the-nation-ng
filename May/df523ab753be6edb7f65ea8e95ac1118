Notore Chemical Industries Plc drew on top-line efficiency to grow its operating profit to N4.63 billion in the first six months of this business year but increased financing cost negatively impacted the bottom-line. The interim report and accounts of Notore for the six-month period ended March 31, 2019 showed that operating profit leapt by 4,251 per cent to N4.63 billion in 2019 compared with N110 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2018. Turnover dropped to N12.68 billion in March 2019 compared with N15.17 billion in March 2018, indicating a decline of 16.03 per cent. The company attributed the decline mainly to plant downtime during the period as a result of the Turn-around maintenance (TAM) programme activities. The TAM programme is expected to be completed by first quarter of   2020, after which the plant will operate at its nameplate capacity. Cost of sales reduced from N11.404 billion to N9.636 billion, while cost of sales margin variation over the two periods, was minimal at 0.80 per cent increase, because natural gas, which constitutes 90 per cent of the input cost, excluding plant depreciation, has a fixed unit price under a 20 year gas contract. Despite the growth of 4,251 per cent in operating profit, Notore ended the period with a loss of N1.942 billion due to net finance cost. Net finance cost rose from N5.14 billion to N6.57 billion. The net loss of N1.94 billion in 2019 represented a considerable improvement on the loss of N4.52 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2018. Notore remained optimistic on the outlook for its business noting that Nigerian fertilizer demand is quite robust and is expected to continue to grow because of the federal government’s agenda to use agriculture as one of the keys to unlock the diversification of the Nigerian economy. According to the company, the domestic fertilizer market is yet to reach its full potential as the consumption of fertilizer per hectare of arable land in Nigeria is below 10kg compared to the 200kg recommended by Food & Agriculture Organisation. Furthermore, the demand for urea and compound fertilizers, such as NPK, from the West African markets and Sahel African states is also quite significant. Notore sold all the urea that it produced during the period under review. The company stated that it would exceed its 2018 full-year urea production figures in 2019 as the current federal government policies in the fertilizer space and demand for NPK and NPK specialty blends are quite favourable for its business. “Consequently, Notore will be producing a significant quantity of NPK and NPK specialty blends this FY to boost its revenues as well as diversify it from urea fertilizer. To enhance profitability, Notore is working on financial initiatives to reduce its finance cost considerably,” Notore stated. Notore, formerly known as O-Secul Fertilizer Company Limited, was established in 2005 to acquire the core assets of the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria (NAFCON). Notore had on August 2, 2018 listed its entire paid up share capital on the NSE, opening up the agro-allied company to the general investing public 13 years after it was privatised by the Federal Government. Notore, a vertically integrated agro-allied, chemical and power group based in Onne, Rivers State, has six subsidiaries including Notore Supply & Trading Mauritius Limited, Notore Power Limited, Notore Seeds Limited, Notore Foods Limited and Notore Industrial City Limited.
