SOME motorcyclists in Lagos have sought the government’s help in recovering their machines seized by the task force. The Motor Operators Association of Lagos State (MOALS), Casso branch, Alagbado, said 36 machines were seized during a task force raid. Its Chairman, Mr. Sunday Bernard, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)  that last Friday Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit operatives stormed the branch park at Casso and forcefully took the motorcycles from the owners. Efforts to convince the officials that the park was in an inner street and not part of the 475 restricted routes failed, he claimed. According to him,  most of the motorcycles were new ones bought on hire purchase by the owners who were either laid off by their former employers or job seekers. Bernard said the seizure of the motorcycles would have degenerated into a feud, but for the intervention of the park’s leadership . But the task force unit’s spokesman,  Adebayo Aribidesi,  said owners of the seized motorcycles violated the Lagos State traffic law. He said in the last five months, the unit had impounded 3,000 motorcycles on the 475 restricted routes and inner streets across the state. The figure, he said, included the motorcycles impounded under bridges and on highways.
