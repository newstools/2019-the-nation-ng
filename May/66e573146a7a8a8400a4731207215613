Alex Iwobi has been named in Arsenal’s provisional squad for tonight’s Europa League semifinal clash against Valencia at the Estadio de Mestalla, the only player of Nigerian descent in the travelling party to Spain. Goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo, defenders Tolaji Bola, Joseph Olowu, Tobi Omole, and wingers Xavier Amaechi and Bukayo Saka, who have been registered for the knockout rounds of the Europa League, have not been selected by Coach Unai Emery. Arsenal beat the Spaniards 3-1 in the first leg thanks to a brace from Alex Lacazette and a crucial late strike from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, with Iwobi watching proceedings from the bench. Since the competition was rebranded the Europa League, starting from the 2009-2010 campaign, only one Nigerian player, Dickson Etuhu, has managed to feature in the showpiece, back in May 2010 when he went the distance as Fulham were beaten by Atlético Madrid. Former Sporting Braga defender Elderson Echiejile is the second Nigerian player to make the matchday squad for a Europa League final but he was an unused substitute in his team’s narrow loss to Porto in 2011. In the 2013 showpiece at the Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam, John Obi Mikel and Victor Moses were on the bench though Chelsea won the cup after beating Benfica. Should Arsenal beat Valencia tonight and go on to win the competition, Iwobi could become the first Nigerian player to play for a winning team, a feat that was not achieved by Mikel and Moses.
