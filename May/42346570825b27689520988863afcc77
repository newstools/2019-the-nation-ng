The Nigerian Air Force on Saturday said it has inflicted heavy casualties on scores of Boko Haram Terrorists at the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno state. According to the spokesman of the Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, the insurgents who were fleeing from the bombardments of Niger and Chadian Air Force met their Waterloo with the Nigerian Air Force. Daramola said in a statement supported with video clips that the insurgents and their structures were destroyed during air strikes conducted by the air force. He said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has inflicted heavy casualties on Islamic State of West Africa (ISWAP) elements in devastating air strikes conducted at Tumbun Hamma on the fringes of Lake Chad yesterday, 24 May 2019. ” The attack was conducted following credible intelligence reports indicating that the terrorists, who had fled the series of air strikes conducted by Nigerian, Nigerien and Chadian Air Forces, around the Malkanori-Tumbun Rego general axis of northern Borno State, had converged in Tumbun Hamma. ” The attack was preceded by series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions which confirmed heavy presence of terrorists in several structures, along with their logistics items, spread across the small settlement. Accordingly, the ATF scrambled an Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location, recording a successful direct hit in the centre of the target area leading to the neutralization of several terrorists as well as the destruction of their structures and logistics. ” The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its operations to completely degrade the terrorists in the Northeast. “
