Africa Region President of World Crafts Council and Director-General of National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Segun Runsewe, has told a gathering of Chinese to disregard the negative narrative about Nigeria that it is a destination for drugs and internet fraud. Speaking at a global cultural tourism forum in China, Runsewe said Nigeria is a notable key player in African affairs and its premium relationship with world economies necessitated certain organised dark syndicates in Black Africa to target its passport and use same to carry out nefarious business deals and related sundry crimes. The NCAC chief urged the Chinese to disregard such negative reports about Nigeria as the country and Black Africa will present the best pictures of cultural tourism destination in the next few years. He said: “I bring you kind greetings from Nigeria and Africa and wish to correct the wrong impression and misleading narrative about Nigeria and Africa as destination for illegal drugs and terrorism. Nigeria is a wonderful country with rich culture, which frowns at acts unbecoming of best human practices.” Runsewe hailed the organisers for inviting him to share his story about Nigeria, saying Nigeria is hospitable, hence a rich cultural tourism destination waiting for Chinese investors and tourists. Stakeholders at the forum lauded the frank contributions and explanations Runsewe presented. They said these would open up the floodgate of business and cultural understanding between Nigeria and China.
