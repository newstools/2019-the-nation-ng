Barcelona publish the list of players who will travel to Liverpool on Monday to take part in the return leg of the Champions League semi-final. Ousmane Dembele has picked up a hamstring injury and is unlikely to play another game this season. Thus, the young Frenchman will stay at home and will not help his team at Anfield. Every other player has been included in the 23-man squad. Even Rafinha who is still injured will join his teammates on the flight to England. Two Barcelona B players Moussa Wague and Inaki Pena accompany the senior squad too. BarcelonaLive
