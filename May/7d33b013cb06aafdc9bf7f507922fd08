He stressed the need for the nation to act fast to save its future leaders. A statement by the commission’s Acting Head, Media and Publicity, Tony Orilade, said Magu spoke through EFCC’s Ibadan Zonal Head, Friday Ebelo when he led a team of officers on a visit to the Oyo State Directorate of the National Orientation Agency (NOA). The EFCC chief sought NOA’s assistance to push the commission’s anti-corruption message to the larger society, especially to the youth, who are to take over the mantle of leadership. He regretted the rate youths engage in cyber-related crimes, adding that efforts to sensitise the public about the menace must be sustained. “We need to synergise on how to get back on track,” he said as he admonished parents to always guide and check their wards’ activities. NOA’s Oyo State Director, Mrs. Dolapo Dosunmu, reaffirmed the good and long-standing relationship between the two agencies.
