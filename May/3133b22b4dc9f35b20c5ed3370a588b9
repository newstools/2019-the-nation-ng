As part of its efforts to enrich the lives of consumers , Pally Agro  has unveiled its new culinary dishes: Banga, a canned fresh palm fruit extract, unripe plantain flour and soya bean oil into the market. The company’s Corporate Affairs Director, Mr. Ifeanyi Dike, while unveiling the new products, stated that though Banga is a popular fresh palm fruits extract among Nigerians, it is still not accessible to those who would have loved to make it part of their culinary due to the herculean way of preparing it. He explained that the new offering, which comes in two sizes of 400grams and 800 grams, would revolutionise the culinary market and set quality standards in that market segment. Dike noted that besides being the first company to produce such a product in the nation’s market, its freshness, and natural oil remain one of the factors that would set the new offering apart from the competition. Expressing the company’s readiness to fight for its own share of the market, Dike explained that the company was already cultivating a farm, which would give the needed advantage of getting its raw materials fresh to complete its production. “Besides employing both direct and indirect marketing to push the new offering, the Banga team would also be visiting universities across the country to further bond the new offering with its target market,” he added. Pally Agro Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Collins Onyeagu, noted that for Nigeria to achieve its food self-sufficiency, more attention should be given to agriculture.
