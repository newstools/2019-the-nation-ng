The Office of Education Quality Assurance (OEQA) Lagos State Ministry of Education has shut an unregistered private school in Orile-Agege area of Lagos State for safety reasons. Director-General OEQA, Mrs. Ronke Soyombo, said in an interview that Multi-Vision School Orile-Agege, flouted safety standards and repeated warnings to relocate before its premises was sealed last week. According to her, the enforcement exercise was to ensure strict compliance to the Lagos State Ministry of Education’s approved guidelines for operating a school in a safe environment in the state. “The school was shut down because of safety reason.  What Lagos State is not ready to condone is for our children to be in dangerous apartments. “We have gone to the school since January; we gave them warning letters to remove because that was a school under high tension wire. “Children cannot be left under high tension wire.  We gave them enough notice but they did not adhere to it. “We told them to relocate. When we tell you to relocate, we give you time but if you fail to do it on the expected date, we will not have any option than to come with our task force to close the school; and that is what we have done,” she said. Mrs. Soyombo advised school owners of where closure and relocation notices had been served to desist from removing the notices as such act attracts sanctions and prosecution by the state government. The Director General also urged parents to stop patronising substandard private schools.
