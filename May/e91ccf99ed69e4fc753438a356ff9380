Seven commercial motorcyclists will be arraigned in court today for allegedly attacking officials of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement). In a statement yesterday, the task force said its officials were attacked at the weekend with stones, bottles and iron rods while on duty at Oworonsoki, Adeniji Adele junction, Obalende, Falomo, Lekki Phase 1 and Ikoyi link-bridge. Task force Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, said four of his men were injured near Lekki Phase 1. He said during the operation, 92 motorcycles were impounded for plying restricted routes, including highways and bridges “During the enforcement, some suspected motorcyclists started shouting and calling the attention of their colleagues in their languages. Thereafter, other motorcyclists from nowhere started throwing stones, bottles and iron rods at my officers,” Egbeyemi added. The task force boss said it was shocking seeing motorcyclists struggling over the right of way with motorists on Ikoyi link-bridge, Falomo, Lekki Phase 1, Adeniji Adele, and                                                                                                                                                                   Obalende. He said two police officers were injured with stones, adding that two other paramilitary officers were attacked with broken bottles. “The government will no longer tolerate attacks on officials and men of the agency. Recently, a police officer with the agency died as a result of the injuries he sustained from miscreants while on enforcement duty near Mile 12.”
