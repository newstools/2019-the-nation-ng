TENI The Entertainer has released another new song with a pop culture edge today titled “Sugar Mummy”The song talks about about the ‘area mummies’ in different Nigerian locales who control the happenings in their area and who all the men follow. Their underworld leadership is unmatched and they wield respect from all they come across like they have a head filled with snakes. That’s what Teni channeled in this new song with a pop culture edge. A few days ago, the self-acclaimed ‘Sugar Mummy of Lagos’ released the song. The video merges colour with mainstream pop culture and shepeteri aesthetics and directed by Prior Gold Pictures. The video is a collision of pop culture, Nigerian street culture and colours.
