Ramadan is a time when people join forces in pursuit of hope, tolerance and peace, United States President Donald Trump has said. Trump hosted an Iftar for Muslim members from his administration and top diplomats from various countries at the White House on Monday night. Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims all across the world, he said. “Ramadan is a time of charity, of giving, and service to our fellow citizens. Ramadan is a very special time. It’s a time to draw closer as families, neighbours and communities. “And Ramadan is a time when people join forces in pursuit of hope, tolerance and peace. It is in this spirit that we come together tonight for Iftar, the traditional Ramadan meal that breaks the daily fast,” Trump said in his brief address in the State Dining Room of the White House. “This evening, our thoughts are also with the religious believers who have endured many trials and hardships in recent weeks. It’s been a very rough period of time. Our hearts are filled with grief for the Muslims who were killed in their mosques in New Zealand, as well as the Christians, Jews and other children of god who were slain in Sri Lanka, California and Pittsburgh,” he added. “We thank god that America is a place founded on the belief that citizens of all faiths can live together in safety and live together in freedom,” he said.
