A group, Human Rights Liberty Access and Peace Defenders Foundation (HURIJE) has accused politicians in Anambra state of using branded vehicles to peddle hard drugs and other harmful products. The group asked the Police to implement its decision of impounding such unmarked vehicles of political parties in the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Mustapha Dandaura, had earlier this week ordered  the arrest and prosecution of persons using unmarked/tinted and masked vehicles without authorization from June 1. The Board of Trustees’ chairman of HURIJE, Dede Uzor Uzor, in a statement on Friday in Awka, also accused the politicians of using the customised party vehicles to perpetrate heinous crimes. He said, “We commend the State Police Command for this bold move and urge them not to relent in implementing this policy to its logical conclusion. “Some of them use it to carry prohibited and regulated and hard drugs as well as other harmful products that constitute dangers to the society and human families. “They sometimes use the vehicles to constitute traffic nuisance on the roads with their recklessness and other glaring traffic violations. “There should be no sacred cows on the prosecution of offenders. Those arrested should not be spared.” Uzor who also lauded police decision to deal with security men escorting vehicles with covered number plates, said the move would not only reduce crime in the state, but also reduce the security personnel intimidation on members of the public.
