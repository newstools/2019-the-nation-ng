May & Baker has been campaigning to reduce the burden of malaria through the introduction of several life-saving interventions including free test. The latest intervention is Malact, one of Nigeria’s most effective anti-malaria drug. As part of its corporate social responsibility initiatives on World Malaria Day to create awareness on the scourge, the company organised a free Malaria testing and drug distribution outreach for over 250 residents of Moshalashi Alhaja, Agege, a highly populated suburb of Lagos. The initiative also involved staff of May & Baker in partnership with the Lagos State Waste Management Authority carrying out an environmental sanitation exercise in the community to promote awareness on how proper environmental management can help reduce the transmission of malaria in line with the theme of this year’s celebrations. Executive Director, Pharma Sales and Marketing, May & Baker, Chukutem Chukuka, said the medical outreach was designed to sensitise Nigerians about the scourge of malaria and guide them on how best to live a malaria-free life.
