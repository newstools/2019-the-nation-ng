The Nigeria Association of Social Workers (NASoW) has condemned the insecurity occasioned by kidnapping, terrorism, banditry, killings and other antisocial behaviours in the country. National President Mashood Mustapha, at an emergency meeting in Abuja, lamented that the level of insecurity across the country is very worrisome to all Nigerias. Mustapha, in a statement in Ibadan by the spokesman, Musliudeen Adebayo, insisted that “It is high time the government involves Social Workers in finding solutions to social problems militating against the progress of the country. The government should follow the footstep of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.” Mustapha, who lamented that social workers who are trained to tackle social problems are not involved in the management of the Internally Displaced Persons Camps (IDPs), rehabilitation centres, among others, noted that these problems will continue to thrive if professionals are not involved. He said: “Social Workers in Nigeria are not happy with the current security situation in the country, and we want the government to be proactive in tackling the menace, as nobody and nowhere is safe again. The government should provide social, political, economic, and security atmosphere so safe, so sure and so reassuring for the growth and development of the country. This insecurity is denying hope to millions of our citizens; a new security approach is urgently needed to protect lives and property.
