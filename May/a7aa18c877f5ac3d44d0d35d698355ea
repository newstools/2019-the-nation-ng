VETERAN actor Adebayo Salami, known as Oga Bello, who recently launched the series, ‘Alagbara,’ said the purpose is to bring back the cinema culture which began at National Theatre years back. Salami said he submitted the script to StarTimes and noted that they are committed to whoever they are dealing with. “When we started the discussion last year, around February, the way they handled the whole thing I observed their determination in promoting African culture,” he said. “I had my doubt at first, I thought they were going to derail from their promises, but I have come to realise that they are accurate. When I put up my script to them, it was checked properly and then we had our time strip, and they did not miss it for once.” The actor who is set to shoot two other seasons said: “We have done two seasons now, which are 26 episodes which will end this month. We are moving to the third and fourth season soon. It is the plan and they are following it. This award they are putting up now is one of its kinds and I am always happy when I see people that are interested in promoting African culture. “Aside promoting the African culture the movie industry in particular needs it. When we started there was nothing like all we have now. We started with the moving theatre, then to cinemas, TV and others. I remember I shot my first movie in 1985 and it was done in celluloid titled Ogun Ajaye. “When we started showing Omo Orunkan, at the National Theatre, where we were given a film room that accommodated 626 audiences, then to 1800 capacity hall, and later move us to a hall of 3628. That was when cinema culture started. We had a good cinema culture,” he emphasized on the important of cinemas, “It is time to bring that back,” he said. The series created exclusively for StarTimes Nigerian showcases power influence of women in society.
