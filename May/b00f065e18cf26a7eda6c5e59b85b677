Nigerians have called for the release of Leah Sharibu, the only Christian among the 110 female students kidnapped at the Government Girls Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State on February 18, 2018, as she marks her 16th birthday in the custody of her captors. Just like the previous year, Leah marks another birthday surrounded by insurgents in a far away hideout without cakes nor candles, amidst fear and fierce. President Muhammadu Buhari had promised that his government would not abandon her. However, as the waiting continues, Nigerians have taken to Social Media to celebrate Leah on her 16th birthday and also to remind Buhari of his promise. At so young an Age, Leah Sharibu has made us realize what it takes to believe in something and how much courage we should have to defend any faith which we’ve adopted, even in the face of persecution… My thoughts and prayers are with her on this day where ever she may be. . — Tipee (@Tipeedouble) May 14, 2019  Happy birthday Leah Sharibu, but the question is, is she still alive? — Hassan@tee5 (@Hassan01500256) May 14, 2019  Dear President @MBuhari, Leah Sharibu is 16 yrs old today. She’s been in captivity for 449 days because of her faith. As the President & C-in-C, kindly use every power available at your disposal to ensure Leah regains her freedom today as a befitting 16th birthday gift to her. — Olúwabùsáyọ̀ Ilésanmí (@Oluwabusayo) May 14, 2019  Wishing Leah Sharibu a happy birthday.
