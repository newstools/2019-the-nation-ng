An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court has sentenced a self-styled car dealer, Adamson Oladimeji Mustapha, to five years imprisonment for stealing Nl9.8million from a United States-based businessman, Olusegun Adesanya. Chief Magistrate Adetokunbo Omoyele convicted Mustapha on one-count of stealing, contrary to Section 285 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. Mrs. Omoyele discharged Mustapha of four other counts of conspiracy, stealing and bail jumping because they were not proven. The court  gave the convict  N5million fine option. “This judgment takes effect from the date of sentence,” Chief Magistrate Omoyele said. The Police Force Headquarters Annex, Lagos, arraigned Mustapha, 40, of 5, Adebola Ojomu Street, Aguda, Surulere, Lagos, on April 22, 2013, before Mrs. E. N. Johnson on a charge marked L/12/A/2013. The matter started d afresh in 2016 and Mustapha was re-arraigned for the same offence before Chief Magistrate Omoyele. Inspector Cyriacus Osuji told the court that between 2005 and 2011 in Lagos and Ogun states, Mustapha, with intent to commit felony conspired with others at large and obtained several vehicles under false pretence from Adesanya. “He obtained six vehicles valued at N12,693,000 on the pretext that he was a car dealer from the complainant. “On the same date and at the same time, he obtained N3,520,000 on the pretext that he was a dealer and he would use the sum to buy vehicles for the complainant.” The fourth charge, for which Mustapha was convicted, accused him of stealing the N19.8m property of Adesanya, through false pretence. Osuji added: “Within the same period, the defendant, at the Force Intelligence Bureau Force Headquarters Annex, Obalende, Lagos, being a suspect in a case of conspiracy and stealing reported by Justus Olusegun Adesanya, with intent to prevent, pervert and obstruct the course of justice, jumped police administrative bail granted to him.”
