Also, the weather here is not favourable because someone actually gets tired easily. We are going to try our best. That’s certain. We are here to make our sponsors, family and country proud,” Abdulrahman said. Abdulrahman ranked 284 according to PSA, played in the Johannesburg Open but lost in the 2nd round of the tournament to Fabian Verseille of France, while Olatunji could not participate due to Visa issues.

Speaking to Olatunji concerning the loss, she said, “It was not easy at all, it’s a tournament for professionals so I expected a challenge from everyone there.

I tried playing my best but I know God is going to do it again for me.” The tournament which started on the 29th April, will end on the 3rd of May 2019, with $5,000 at stake for the winners of both men and women categories.
