Mrs Yemisi Suswam, wife of former Benue Governor and Senator-elect, Gabriel Suswam, says a simple lifestyle is the best approach to living healthy and fulfilled lives. Yemisi made the observation while addressing newsmen on the occasion of her 52nd birthday celebration. The former governor’s wife said that her youthful look at 52 could only be credited to God and the simple lifestyle she lives. “I will not say my look can be credited to what I do or do not do, my lifestyle is very simple, it’s a lifestyle of good food, not over feeding, eating at the right time and exercising. The Bible says bodily exercise profits a little, that little goes a long way. My lifestyle is very simple but it is straightforward and I don’t do any extraordinary thing,” she said. According to her, “ if I enter the bathroom with my husband, I come out before him so I do not do anything spectacular, I just make sure that I do the right thing at the right time.” She also cautioned against eating meals, particularly heavy meals like pounded yam late at night, saying keeping healthy was a lifestyle that required a lot of discipline. Yemisi, who turned 52 on April 30, said she marked the day with a 24-hour praise session to appreciate God for all He had done for her and her family.
