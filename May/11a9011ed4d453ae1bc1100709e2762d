RAPID Response Squad (RRS) operatives have arrested a man who posed as a soldier for allegedly violating a traffic law. Yusuf Quadri, 22, was nabbed while riding his motorcycle on Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way,  Ikeja, during a stop-and-search by the  RRS. He was said to have told the RRS that he was a military officer, but investigation showed that he was an impostor. The suspect, RRS claimed, admitted that he was a fake soldier, adding that he told detectives that he stole the uniform of a newly promoted military officer and took a photograph with it to produce  an identity card. He was said to have been using the uniform and the identity card to deceive security operatives, government officials and the public. The suspect has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba.
