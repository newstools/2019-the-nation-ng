The Board of Trustees of the National Youth Council of Nigeria has de-recognised all the executive members of the council. It said the decision not to recognise any of the executive members of the youth body was taken during an emergency meeting of the board where it considered various court orders which restrained the council from conducting any elective congress pending the determination of the substantive suits. The BOT of the NYCN stated this in a communiqué made available to reporters on yesterday in Abuja. It was signed by Chairman of the BOT, Dickson Akon and its Secretary, Sola Oladeji. The board said it frowned at the action of a factional president of the council, Bello Shagari, who adopted the presidential candidate of a major opposition political party, noting that the council remained neutral in political matters. It stated that a National Management Committee meeting would be convened by the board soon to “chart the way forward for the youth body.”
