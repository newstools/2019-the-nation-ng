â€¢Two children injured Residents of Ogodo Valley at Mende, Maryland, Lagos, were thrown into panic on Sunday night, as four gunmen suspected to be cultists, killed one man and injured two children. Eyewitnesses told The Nation that the victim, simply identified as Dare Atlanta, who sold Indian hemp, was hanging out with his friends at the valley when he received a call from his killers, who pretended to be his customers, around 9pm. It was learnt that the victim headed for Atiba Osbourne Street, Mende, Maryland, to meet them and he was immediately shot in the head. In a bid to escape, the killers reportedly shot sporadically, injuring a boy and a girl, who were hit by stray bullets. The body was removed by a police patrol team from Anthony Division. An officer, who preferred anonymity, said yesterday that investigation was on to establish the motive behind the killing, adding that efforts were ongoing to arrest the killers. A resident said the killing might have been connected to a recent clash among suspected cultists from Mende and Ojota.
