Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has unveiled the newly-constructed layby at Allen roundabout and Obafemi Awolowo Way, Ikeja. He pledged to explore ways of easing movements on the roads. The governor, represented by the Commissioner for Transportation ‘Ladi Lawanson, said yesterday that the layby and slip road with bus shelter were constructed to decongest traffic occasioned by the loading and offloading of passengers, especially during peak hours. He said: “Its completion will no doubt impact directly on travel time, leading to reduction of traffic congestion by diverting the picking and dropping of passengers away from the main road to the slip road and layby. “This layby project is not the first; the multiple layby at Oworosoki, Ketu inward Ikorodu, the car wash layby, the slip road at Olopomeji Road, the layby located at Alapere bus stop and others in the state are all maximally in use. They are all constructed for the same purpose of decongesting traffic.” Ambode said achieving success in decongesting the road required the people to continue to use the infrastructures responsibly and partner the government to ease traffic. “This requires that we work together as a team to obey traffic rules and regulations, if we must encourage investors from far and near to feel safe at all times.” The governor, who said the projects were made possible by tax payers’ money, urged Lagosians to take over ownership of the projects across the state and protect them. “As you take ownership and prevent them from vandalisation while paying your tax, you will encourage the government to do more,” he said. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Taiwo Olufemi Salaam, said layby was an iconic project that represented the emerging picture of the new Lagos, as witnessed in the general infrastructural development in the state. He urged road transport unions, their members and the public to make good use of the facility.
