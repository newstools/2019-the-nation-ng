Fadeyi said those arrested would be charged to court today (Friday). Giving the breakdown of the arrests, Fadeyi said, “three NURTW miscreants were arrested at our Challenge division on Wednesday and the other three were nabbed on Thursday at Agodi area. “The DPO in Agodi with the assistance from the SARS made the latest arrests possible. They (NURTW) members have been warned from fomenting troubles in the state,” Fadeyi added.
