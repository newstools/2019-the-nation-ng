The Bayelsa State Government has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for shifting the governorship election from November 2 to November 16, 2019. The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson in a statement said the action of the commission was a welcome development. He said the Prof. Mahmmud Yakubu-led INEC had done for the state an unforgettable gesture that would never be taken for granted and assured the commission of the sincere and immeasurable gratitude of the government and people of the state. He said by heeding to the plea of the government and other critical stakeholders to shift the date, INEC demonstrated that it listened to genuine complaints and that its decision on electoral matters were not cast in stone. Iworiso-Markson said with such uprightness, there was a renewed feeling among the people that the commission would conduct a free, fair and credible election on November 16. The Information Commissioner stressed that the PDP led Restoration Government and all Bayelsans were looking forward to the election and believing that their votes would count and the outcome would be a true reflection of their ballot expression. He said with the shift in the date, the state would now have a successful thanksgiving day celebration, to appreciate God as usual for the peace and progress in the state in over seven years of Governor Seriake Dickson’s administration. “Being the last event for Governor Dickson as the state helmsman, this year’s thanksgiving day celebration will be grandiose. We call on Bayelsans to pray fervently and look forward to the day”, he said.
