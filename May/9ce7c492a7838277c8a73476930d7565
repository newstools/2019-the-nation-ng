Nigeria international Odion Ighalo got on the scorer’s sheet for the seventh time this season as Shanghai Shenhua suffered their fifth defeat of the season in the Chinese Super League. Shanghai Shenhua lost 1-2 to Shenzen FC at Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre yesterday. Ighalo equalized for Shanghai Shenhua from the spot before Harold Preciado broke Shanghai’s fans’ hearts by  scoring Shenzen FC’s winning goal in the 89th minute. Li Yuanyi had given Shenzen the lead three minutes after the hour mark. Shanghai Shenhua, who have not won their last 4 league matches, are 11th on the 16-team table with 7 points in 8 matches. Ighalo is expected to lead the Super Eagles attack in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, scheduled for June and July, where they will face Burundi, Guinea and Madagascar.
