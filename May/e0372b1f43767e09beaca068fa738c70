Mokalik’, a new movie from Nollywood filmmaker, Kunle Afolayan is set for release in cinemas on May 31, 2019. The movie follows the career of an 11-year-old boy, Jaiye, from the middle-class suburbs who spends the day as a lowly apprentice at a mechanic workshop in order to view life from the other side of the tracks… When his father arrives to take him home, Jaiye has to make up his mind if he wants to return to school… or take on his apprenticeship full time. “Mokalik’ stars awards-winning singer, Simi, alongside other prominent actors like Femi Adebayo, Charles Okocha, Faithia Williams, Lateef Oladimeji, and comic actors like Wale Akorede (Okunu), Ayo Ogunshina (Papa Lolo) and Dayo Akinpelu (Alabi Yellow). The movie which has the support of Air France and Canon is set to be on Netflix as well. Kunle’s other works such as ‘The Figurine- Araromire’; ‘Irapada’; ‘Phone Swap’; ‘October 1’; ‘The CEO’ and ‘The Bridge’ would also be on Netflix. “We are excited about having our other films, including ‘Mokalik’ on Netflix, as that will assuage our fans who have been sending messages from all over the world, complaining of not having access to our films,” Kunle had said when the deal was brokered with Netflix in Amsterdam in March.
