Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed that Roberto Firmino is unlikely to be fit for the Champions League semi-final, second leg clash at home to Barcelona on Tuesday. Firmino has been struggling with a groin problem and was only able to feature as a substitute as Liverpool were beaten 3-0 in the Nou Camp in the first leg. The Brazil international wasn’t included in Liverpool’s matchday squad for Saturday’s Premier League game away to Newcastle, and Klopp expressed concern regarding the situation. Klopp told Sky Sports: ‘Bobby didn’t start at Barcelona, he had problems, he has still problems, he’s not even in the squad, he’s just not available. That’s just how it is. So we have to accept it, and that’s why It’s easy to leave him out because the medical department said no chance. ‘It doesn’t look really good to be honest. It’s the situation, we all thought it would be quicker, especially he thought it would be quicker, but it doesn’t work out so we have to wait. Midweek is not really likely.’ Firmino has been hugely important for Liverpool this campaign – he has scored 16 goals and provided eight assists across all competitions. Klopp elected to start midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum as a false nine against Barcelona, while Daniel Sturridge started up front against Newcastle.
