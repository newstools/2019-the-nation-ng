The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) said it will begin the enrolment of Nigerians residing in the United States into its national data base today. The programme is currently going on in South Africa, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom (UK). The National Identity Number (NIN) enrolment which will involve the demographic & biometrics data capture, is in collaboration with Thebez Global Resources Ltd, Defcon Systems Limitedand National eAuthentication Limited (NeAL), indigenous firms licensed by the NIMC to serve as its agents, and carry out enrolment services across the globe with a view to ensuring best-in-class services and inclusivity. NIMC Director-General/CEO, Aliyu Aziz said the extension is in line with NIMC’s mandate to ensure that all the citizens of Nigeria, those in the diaspora and legal residents  are enrolled into the National Identity Database (NIDB)and issued the unique NIN to applicants upon successful enrolment. “The programme will make it easier for Nigerians in Diaspora to be identified, as the Federal Government of Nigeria has made the possession of NIN a mandatory requirement for elections, bank account opening, land transactions, access to legal/health services, acquisition/renewal of the International passport, driver’s licence and the ECOWAS travel document, amongst others,” EAziz said. The programme is scheduled to go live from today  in Washington DC  at 11900 Parklawn Drive, Suite 160 Rockville, MD 20852.
