The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has granted the request of Bayelsa State to shift its governorship election from November 2 to 16. INEC announced this yesterday in Abuja. A statement by its National Commissioner in Charge of Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, said: “It will be recalled that on April 9, the INEC released the timetable and schedule of activities for the Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections. The commission fixed November 2 for the elections to hold in both states. “However, the commission has received several appeals from the government, State Assembly, elders, religious leaders, traditional rulers and other critical stakeholders in Bayelsa State that the election date coincides with the state’s annual Thanksgiving Day, which is backed by the Bayelsa State Thanksgiving Day Law 2012. “After a careful consideration of the appeals, the commission, at its regular weekly meeting on May 16, decided to shift the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states to Saturday, November 16. “The timelines for all other activities leading to the elections have also been adjusted to align with the new date. The amended timetable and schedule of activities for the elections are attached to this press release.”
