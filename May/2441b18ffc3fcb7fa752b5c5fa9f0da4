The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has said the proposed national carrier was suspended because members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) were divided on the modalities for its establishment. The Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika had last year September  announced the suspension of the proposed national carrier called ‘Nigeria Air’. Speaking during his valedictory press briefing in Abuja yesterday, Amaechi stated the project has not been abandoned. He said: “On national carrier, (the) cabinet is divided on the issue of modality. There are those who believe that the Federal Government should invest and then we can sell the equity later. “There are also those who believe that no, and from day one they say let us get investors in and give them the franchise of Nigeria Airways or Air Nigeria or whatever it is called. That is where we are and that is what held it down. But as for whether it is still in our plan, it is and has not been abandoned.”
