A 17-year-old girl identified as Rachel was yesterday rescued from suspected ritualists’ den at Ijanikin, Lagos, where she was taken to by three men. The girl, a make-up apprentice, was said to have been hypnotised and abducted on Wednesday morning while on an errand along Ibasa Road, Alasia, Ijanikin, a Lagos suburb. Her abductors were said to have taken her to a secluded place at Dan Ajayi Street, Ijanikin, where they allegedly perfected plans to kill her, but she miraculously regained consciousness and screamed “the blood of Jesus.” Her scream was said to have attracted neighbours, who invaded the house, but before they got there, the suspected ritualists had escaped through the bush. A resident, Chika Ugochukwu, said the suspected ritualists packed to the area last year, adding that people hardly bothered about their activities since their home was isolated from others. Another neighbour, Tochukwu, said the suspects allegedly touched the girl with a charm, which made her to follow them unconsciously. “The suspects were already preparing the girl to be used for rituals when some neighbours heard her scream. The shrine where they took her to is behind an isolated house at Dan Ajayi Street. The suspects fled when they knew that the game was up,” he said.
