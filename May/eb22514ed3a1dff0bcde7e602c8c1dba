Legendary Juju act, Richard Akinwumni Olanrewaju aka Chief Richardson of America has reiterated that the Juju music is very much active in Nigeria and no style of African music can outperform it. “To say Fuji or Afropop is overshadowing Juju music makes no sense,” said Chief Richardson, who has performed both locally and internationally with his band, the Afro Vibration Beats for over 25 years. “Juju music is still active but has been modernized and blended with New Skool sounds. You know, when a particular sound is remix, it sound different in the people’s hear but as for a professional like me, I can easily feel the Juju vibes in many songs. “There is nothing bad for guys singing my songs but the problem we are having in Nigeria is that we don’t have a structure, everybody does whatever they like because nobody controls what anyone does. That is why it is important for old musicians like me to also blend and move with the trend. Chief Richardson has recorded albums which includes ‘My dear I love’, ‘Democracy’, ‘Spread Love’, ‘Not Aids’ (an awareness album), ‘Precious Mother’ and ‘Ajimobi.’ His latest record is titled, ‘Let’s Dance and Rejoice.’ The cultural promoter also has some advice for Nigerians. “Like I sing in my album, titled, ‘Democracy’, what Nigerians deserves is true democracy,” he said. “Unlike other countries, our own democracy is upside down. A lot of people are suffering, people are dying and the economy is bad. What we need is basic things like stable electricity, good roads, well equipped hospital. “We should work together to rebuild the economy, because the way things are going so bad due to the lack of good governance.” Chief Richardson hails from Oyo State and has lived in the US for 39 years.
