Prominent Lagos monarch, Elegushi of Ikate Kingdom, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi has called on Muslims to pray for the country, as the nation tries to surmount the developmental challenges confronting it. In a statement by his Special Assistant, Public Affairs Tope Oyefeso, the monarch noted that as the government of the day is making efforts to make life better for the citizens, Islamic faithful should use the this Fasting period to pray for God’s intervention in the affairs of the nation. ”Ramadan is a pious month and we are all aware of the blessings associated with this period, it is therefore my request that as we observe this critical injunction of Allah, we should remember Nigeria, our country in prayers and commit her affairs and well-being into the hands of the Almighty,” he said. Oba Elegushi enjoined Muslim faithful to improve on their good deeds during the period, as commanded by God and also be their brothers’ keeper by showing kindness to the underprivileged.
