Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) elders’ forum has said the election of Governor Kayode Fayemi as the new chairman of Nigeria’s Governors Forum (NGF) is well-deserved. A congratulatory message by the Chairman of Ekiti Elders’ Forum, Asiwaju George Akosile, said the position would usher positive dividends of democracy to Nigerians. He added that the new position was due to the hard work, honour and integrity displayed by Kayode over a period of time. Akosile noted that it was the first of its kind for any Southwest leader to occupy the office, stressing that the Ekiti State governor has distinguished himself as deserving of the new position. He said: “Your unanimous election to this enviable position is as a result of your ability to strategise, your loyalty, commitment, good rapport and a wonderful sense of humour to others. “The elders view with a very strong opinion that the position would add value to the lives of the people. We also congratulate your Excellency on the confirmation of the electoral mandate freely given to you by the people of Ekiti State in the Supreme Court judgment. “With the removal of all the electoral litigations, the elders strongly believe that you and your team would be in a better position to deliver the four cardinal points embedded in your transformational agenda for Ekiti people.” He said the elders see the two achievements as a call to service, urging the governor not to disappoint Ekiti people and Nigerians in general.
