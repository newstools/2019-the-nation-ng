The crisis rocking Tai Solarin College of Education (TASCE), Omu-Ijebu, Ogun State, took another dimension as protesting workers gathered in front of the school main gate last week to  organise mock burial rites for the Provost of the college, Dr Lukmon Adeola Kiadese. The workers  were angry over unpaid salaries arrears, cooperative deductions and unremitted pension, among others. The workers displayed the portrait of Kiadese and shared akara (bean cake) supposedly to wish him farewell. Addressing a briefing at Omu-Ijebu in Ogun State, Kiadese said he was highly embarrassed to see such anomalies on campus, adding that it was about time COTAS stopped such unwholesome attitude. He described the workers’ action as against the plea bargaining made with the Ogun State governor-elect Prince Dapo Abiodun. Kiadese recalled that Abiodun had earlier waded into the matter and promised to personally visit the institution as soon as he resumed office. He said it is regrettable that COTAS backpedalled on the agreement, burned down his portrait and fried beans cake during their demonstrations. Kiadese said: “All what they are doing is against the rule of law. Nobody should be wishing anybody dead because the truth is, I am not the one owing them, it’s the government. They should go to Oke-Mosan (Governor House) and demonstrate, but not on the campus.” He added that it was now clear that there some external forces who are lobbying to upstage are using COTAS to fuel the crisis. He said despite that part of the workers’ salaries have been paid, the Aborisade-led coalition were really after his life and not their salaries any longer. Kiadese alleged that workers invited herbalists to place some concoctions at certain parts of the university, scaring away students in the process.
