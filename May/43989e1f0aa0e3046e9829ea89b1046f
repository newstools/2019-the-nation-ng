The All Progressives Congress ward leaders in Ifaki Ekiti, Ido/Osi Local government have condemned the suspension of former governor, Segun Oni for alleged anti- party activities. The leaders of the party in the two wards in his hometown described the suspension as outright illegality and shameful, having allegedly violated the procedure of the party. Those who signed the statement from the two wards rejecting the party’s position are: Michael Durodola, Tayo Okanlawon, Ebenezer Ogunlana and Sola Ilori. According to the statement signed by some leaders of the party yesterday, they dissociated themselves from the suspension, saying it was an act of disrespect and contempt of the party’s legal framework. The statement said: “The ward executives’ decision to suspend Segun Oni did not receive the blessing of generality of Ifaki wards’ APC Leaders. “The concocted allegations were unfounded. Names of those  said to have raised allegations of anti party against Oni were not mentioned, neither were they invited. “The faceless committee they said they set up did not properly invite the former governor. The suspension letter written to the former Governor has no signatories and this rendered it useless. “With the above, we the entire elders of the APC in the two wards in Ifaki reject this suspension and we urge the party members and the public to discountenance it”, they said. The party had earlier summoned the former Deputy Chairman (South) to defend himself within seven days, which elapsed on May 1st, against allegation leveled by some party members.
