The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) announced the release of 1,792,719 results of candidates who sat for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) on Saturday. The JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, announcing the release of the results in Abuja on Saturday directed the candidates to send ‘RESULT’ to the short code, 55019, on their mobile phones. He added that the code should be sent using the same phone number that candidates used to register for the examination. Another way to check for your results is: Note that UTME results are released in batches. If the portal returns with ‘You Do Not Have Any Result Yet’, that implies your result is not yet ready. So you have to check back later.
