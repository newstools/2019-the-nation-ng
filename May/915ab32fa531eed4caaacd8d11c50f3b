An elderly Australian woman has been charged with torturing animals after she allegedly abducted a pelican from a river, Police said on Monday. The 73-year-old was seen feeding fish to a pelican in Tuncurry, about 300 kilometres North of Sydney, in April. “The woman then grabbed the pelican and put it in her car boot, with the wing observed to be protruding from the closed boot,’’ police said in a statement. Police stopped her car and made her release the injured bird. Further investigation led officers on Friday to search her home, where they allegedly seized items relating to the cruelty of animals. “Police also located a caged magpie with its beak removed. The bird was taken to a vet where it was euthanised due to the injuries. “Mobile phones seized from the house depicted images and videos of animals, including a dog and rabbit, that had allegedly been mutilated in a public location.’’ The woman will appear in court on May 22, where police will allege she goes to public places and gains the trust of animals by feeding them, before taking them home and torturing them over an extended period of time. Police alleged she then takes them to a veterinarian, claiming they were found injured and require euthanising. NAN
