A group of indigenous Gbagyi people of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Tuesday disrupted traffic flow on the Umaru Musa Yar’dua way in protest. The protesters blocked the highway which leads to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport for about an hour, thereby causing gridlock. Some air travelers, who were rushing to catch their flights at the airport, were caught up in the situation. A protestor, who identified himself as Fred Ekeng, said that the protest was to demand for recognition as indigenous people of the FCT. He said the protest was to tell government that the people should be given their proper place in the territory. According to him, the people are saying no to taking over of their lands without giving them alternative. “We came here to express our displeasure with the way the government and the military are seizing our lands without compensation and treating us like second class citizens in our own land. “We are saying that henceforth, the position of the Minister of FCT should be held by an indigene instead of an outsider. “We also want the government to treat us with respect because they keep taking over our lands and pushing us into the interior without proper infrastructure,“ he said. The operatives of the Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps were seen directing traffic after the protesters left the road. Normal traffic resumed immediately as air passengers and other commuters continued their activities.
