For 17-year-old Damian Leonard Anyogo, from Yache in Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State whose dream is to play for the Super Eagles, the future already seems bright as a result of invitations for football trials in the United Kingdom. At present, the first-year Law student of Afe Babalola University Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) Ekiti State, Anyogo who has the consent of his parents, has gotten invitations for U-18 trials from Essex, Manchester, Sheffield and West London later this month. Cross River State has produced footballers, who have donned the colours of the Nigerian national team, and Anyogo, who plays in the attacking position and already is a member of his university team, says he is determined to pursue a career in football and emerge at the top. According to him, he developed a passion for the game right from when he was a child and has been working hard at it since then; playing for both the elementary and secondary schools he attended. “I have put a lot of hard work and determination. I have been playing since I was a child and my dream is to play for the National Team one day. I dream to take the country to the World Cup and win,” he said.
