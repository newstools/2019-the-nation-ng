 One of the 12 Stadia to be used for the 2022 world cup in Qatar, The Al Wakrah stadium has been unveiled signaling its readiness for action close to five years to the event billed for November 21-December 18. The stadium which controversially has been named “Vagina Stadium” with fans citing its shape for the label is the first to be completed as work continues on the remaining 11 scattered in seven regions of Lusail ,Doha ,Al Khor,Ash-Shamal,Al Wakrah, Umm Salal and Al Rayyan. The Al Wakrah stadium will host matches up to the quarter-finals and contains innovative cooling technology to bring temperatures down for the 40,000 fans. It was designed by the late British-Iraqi architect, Dame Zaha Hadid, who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2016, aged 65. When her plans were first released in 2013 they were said to have been inspired by the flowing shape of a dhow boat, a traditional Arabian pearl diving and fishing vessel. The drawings were topped with a structure resembling the sails of a dhow. But the images went viral with commentators suggesting the stadium looked more like female genitalia. At the time, Dame Zaha hit back saying: ‘It’s really embarrassing they come up with nonsense stuff like this. What are they saying? Everything with a hole in it is a vagina? That’s ridiculous.’ The architect was also behind great buildings such as the Aquatics Centre at the 2012 London Olympics, the MAXXI Museum in Italy and the Guangzhou Opera House in China The 2022 World Cup has already been moved to the winter months to avoid the searing summer temperatures in the Gulf. The stadium is 12 miles south of the capital Doha and has been designed to be able to bring down the heat to around 22C for spectators and players. Cold air will be piped in through vents while the retractable roof will provide shade to the pitch.
