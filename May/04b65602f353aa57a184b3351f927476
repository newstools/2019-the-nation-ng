An elder statesman Chief Gilbert Olokesusi has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to consider setting up an anti-corruption court in his second term. He said the court should be in each state to speed up adjudication of corruption cases. According to him, the existing courts are overstretched. The Octogenarian noted that an anti-corruption court will be able to focus solely on anti-graft cases with strict timelines for deciding them. Olokesusi, a founding member of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) which metamorphosed into the All Progressives Congress (APC), expressed optimism that Buhari would surpass his first term achievements. The self-styled “apostle of Buharism”, in a statement, said the APC has no excuse not to take Nigeria to the next level as promised. “President Buhari’s anti-corruption stand is the last hope of the common man. Yet, the greatest fight put up by corruption is unnoticed. This is how corruption gives anti-corruption a deadly blow. “Anti-corruption courts must be established in every state and all such cases must be time-barred, say not more than three months,” he said. Olokesusi also urged Buhari to evolve laws and mechanisms to deal decisively with kidnapping and terrorism. He said the President should not hesitate to replace any minister or official who fails to perform in his second term. He expressed confidence that Buhari will reduce unemployment. “One of the cardinals of Buharism is that Buhari will bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. “I believe that under Buhari’s watch, by January 2023, all unemployed Nigerians must be on a payroll of not less than the minimum wage,” he said. Olokesusi looks forward to a harmonious relationship between the presidency and the ninth National Assembly. “Everything must be done embryonically now to evolve a sane ninth assembly,” he added
