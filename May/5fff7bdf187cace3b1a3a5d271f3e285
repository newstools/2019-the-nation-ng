The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, has urged Muslims to use the period of Ramadan to pray for the survival of the country. He also called on Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, in over overcoming nation’s socio-political, economic and security challenges. Speaking at the Tafsir he organised at the Palace Square in Iwo, Oba Akanbi said the hallmark of patriotism is when the citizens support the ruling party to achieve its vision that “can transform the economy and lives of individuals resident in the country.” The Oluwo described the “overwhelming support of Nigerians to the Buhari-Osinbajo ticket at the Presidential election as recognition of virile governance and testimony of the trust Nigerians have in present Federal Government.” The Oluwo, who particularly hailed Osinbajo’s performance in office, said he was proud of him as a brilliant Nigerian and decent Yoruba man, who according to him, have exhibited virtuous character associated with the Southwest geo-political zone. The monarch prayed for the vice president for his loyalty to Buhari and his patriotism to Nigeria, saying “Osinbajo deserved to be compensated with our prayers.” He noted Osinbajo’s contribution the victory of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), at the last general elections, admonishing the Yoruba to do more for their leaders in future polls. He described the last general election as the voice of the masses, saying the results of the poll have shown that power had finally shifted to the masses. He praised the Vice President for extending the social intervention programme of the federal government, the Tradermoni, to Iwo, expressing joy that the scheme has transformed many lives positively.
