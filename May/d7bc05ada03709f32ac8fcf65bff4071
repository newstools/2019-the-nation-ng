A teenager has been stabbed to death after being chased by a man in south-east London, police said. Police were called by the London ambulance service on Sunday at about 9.30pm to reports of a stabbing on Tiverton Street in Southwark. Officers and paramedics found an 18-year-old man with stab injuries. He was taken to a south London hospital where he died at 10:51pm. The victim has yet to be identified but his next of kin have been informed, the Metropolitan police said. A postmortem examination will be held in due course. The Met said there have been no arrests and its inquiries continue. Officers were reviewing local CCTV footage, making house-to-house calls and undertaking forensic analysis at the scene. DCI Richard Leonard, from the homicide and major crime command, said: “We need those who have information about the culprit(s) for this murder to get in touch with police immediately. “The victim was seen being chased by another male wearing a grey or blue hoodie from Newington Gardens into Tiverton Street where he was attacked and shortly after found by police and London air ambulance. Last Wednesday, Tashaun Aird, 15, was killed after an altercation with a group of youths in Somerford Grove, Hackney. There have been no arrests and police are appealing for information. The killing was the 44th homicide in the capital this year and the 27th fatal stabbing. theguardian.com
