The Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) has handed over to the police one of its  officials for allegedly assaulting three homeless children in Oshodi. Its Chairman, Israel Ajao, a retired Deputy Inspector-General of suspect, Idowu Adekunle, told The Nation yesterday that the official committed the act in a school where the kids sought refuge after being abandoned by their parents. Adekunle was said to have burnt one of the children on the buttocks  with an iron. The school owner and his wife were said to have attempted  to save Adekunle, who Ajao said was being investigated. Ajao said Adekunle would be prosecuted,  if found culpable. “Adekunle has been arrested and handed over to the police for investigation and possible prosecution. We have no room for abuse of human rights. His fate will be determined by the outcome of police investigation,” Ajao said. Meanwhile, the police have arrested two persons for allegedly conniving with five others to gang-rape a minor in Oshodi. The suspects, who are being detained at the Makinde Police Station, Mafoluku, Oshodi, are assisting the police in their investigation. A source said the suspects’ parents were trying to  induce the victim to drop the case. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said investigations were ongoing.
