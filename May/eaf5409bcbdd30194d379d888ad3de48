A heavyweight unification fight between Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder ‘must happen next’, according to Eddie Hearn. AJ’s promoter was impressed by the American’s first-round knockout of Dominic Breazeale on Saturday.  And provided Joshua overcomes Andy Ruiz on June 1, Hearn says there will be no excuses not to make the fight with Wilder. ‘That was an impressive win for Deontay – he’s exciting to watch,’ he told Sky Sports. ‘He has taken care of business, now AJ needs to do the same against Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden on June 1. The fight with AJ and Wilder is the biggest fight in the sport and all being well in two weeks’ time it must happen next – no excuses, this is the fight that will change the sport globally. ”It’s a legacy fight and AJ wants it so bad. Two big, fast, dangerous and fearless world heavyweight world champions that can turn the lights out with a blink of the eye – it’s a must. First things first, taking care of business on his American debut on June 1 and send a message straight back.” Wilder is also under pressure to give the fans what they want and all roads appear to lead to a massive Anglo-American showdown.
