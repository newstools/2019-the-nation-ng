Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has suspended indefinitely the Coordinator of Anti-Grazing Agency, Mr. Sola Durodola over offensive comment on herdsmen. According to a statement dated May, 13 and signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, Durodola is to hand over all government properties in his custody to the Director of Anti–Grazing. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode said: “the suspension is with immediate effect”. The suspension came barely 42 hrs after Durodola addressed journalists and claimed government was set to commence registration of herdsmen in the state to forestall herdsmen-farmer clashes. The Commissioner for Information, Tourism and Values Orientation, Mr. Muyiwa Olumilua however debunked the claim, describing it as absolute falsehood. Olumilua said the claim does not represent and capture the agenda of the Fayemi-led administration. The Commissioner disclosed that the investment of the Governor in the security of lives and property of people was yielding positive result, stressing such offensive statement could undermine the peace of the State. He added a law regulating activities of herdsmen and farmers was already in place, saying there was need to refute any form of duplicity that capable of causing confusion. He urged public to discountenance the comments and continue their legitimate businesses, without any form of apprehension. The Commissioner stopped all government functionaries serving in MDAs from addressing the media on sensitive issues without clearance from top echelon of government, saying failure to comply will warrant unpleasant sanctions against erring government functionaries.
