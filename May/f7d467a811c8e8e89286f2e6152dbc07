The Conference of Registered Political Parties (CRPP) in Lagos State on Friday reflected on the recent general elections, which produced Babajide Sanwo-Olu as governor-elect. The group said the exercise was free, fair and credible, adding that the umpire, police and other stakeholders deserved commendation. According to CRPP, the call for the cancellation by some unscrupulous elements of the poll lacked justification and worthy of condemnation. CRPP chairman Fatai Taiwo, an engineer, said the call for the cancellation based on the unfounded rumour that the governor-elect is not of sound mind emanated from enemies of progress who do not mean well for the state. He said the group will not accept any form of character assassination targeted at Sanwo-Olu. Taiwo added: “We condemn totally the campaign of calming using the pages of newspapers and sponsored online media as the altar of justice for the just concluded election by a group of people. “The media attack against the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) by some quarters who have not added value to the Lagos polity and would stop at nothing to pull Lagos State down is highly condemned. It is an abortion to democracy they claim to strengthen.” The group congratulates Sanwo-Olu and other newly elected legislators, urging them to render selfless service to the state. CRPP commanded Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for his selfless service and unrelenting determination and commitment to the progress of Lagos State. The group said the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election showed that nobody can query Tinubu’s paranormal intelligence. Urging those who are not pleased with the outcome of the election to sheath their sword, CRPP advised them to wait for their time. Taiwo added: “CRPP, Lagos State will not tolerate any more media attack on Project Lagos, a project of our dream.”
