A unemployed man, Qudus Akinwale, who allegedly stole underwear and other clothing items worth N100,000 belonging to his friend’s neighbours, was on Thursday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Akinwale, 29, of No. 29, Freeman Street, Lagos Island, was arraigned by the police on a one-count charge of stealing before Mrs O. O. Adeshina. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh told the court that Akinwale committed the offence on April 22, at about 11:50am at No. 112, Adeniji Adele Road, Lagos Island. He said the clothes belonged to the complainant, Mrs Rebecca Ajala. Mameh alleged that the defendant gained entry into the premises on the pretext that he wanted to visit a friend who lived downstairs. He went to the back of the building, took some of the clothes hanging on the line before sneaking into an apartment for more clothes. The apartment owner walked in on him as he was trying out her husband’s shirt and raised the alarm. Akinwale allegedly sped out and ran upstairs where he was caught by other occupants of the building. “The complainant, who was sleeping in her apartment, was awakened by the shouts of her neighbours as they pursued the defendant. She came out and found out that the defendant had taken her clothes from the washing line,” Mameh said. The offence, the prosecutor alleged, contravened Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Akinwale pleaded “not guilty”. Magistrate Adeshina granted him N50, 000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on May 15.
