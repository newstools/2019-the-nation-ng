Special Media Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina, has disclosed that the 2017 illness that saw the President spend most parts of the year in London was a debilitating illness. He stated this in an opinion piece titled “PMB’s second term: Ain’t no stopping us now, we’re on the move”. He also alleged that it may be a spiritual attack on the President by those whom he described as adversaries who wanted to get rid of him because of his perceived honesty. Adesina had once denied that the President went to London for medical treatment. The presidency had claimed during the Buhari’s trip that he was in London between January 19 March 10, 2017, to “undergo routine medical check-ups” during a short holiday. But Buhari on his return to the country tacitly admitted that he was very ill, telling his cabinet members that; “I couldn’t recall being so sick since I was a young man, including the military with its ups and downs.” He also disclosed that he had “blood transfusions, going to the laboratories and so on and so forth.” Adesina wrote: “A massive coalition for change was built around him, and good Nigerians stood up for the champion. Did he live happily ever after? Not on your lives! “The adversaries went after him. Ran, pursued, and attempted to overtake. All sorts of things, physical and spiritual, were thrown at him, just to get rid of the man who would not steal, and not allow people to steal.” “A debilitating illness came. And for most of 2017, the President was receiving medical attention, both at home and abroad. Instead of goodwill and prayers, they were rejoicing. We’ve finally stopped him, they gloated. But did they? Could they? Not if God was still alive.” “Ain’t no stopping Buhari, as in August 2017, he got back his groove. His health rebounded, and he resumed work fully.”
