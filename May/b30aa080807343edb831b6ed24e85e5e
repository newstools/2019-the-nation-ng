religious leaders have urged local government workers to be diligent in discharging their duties. The duo of Imam of Al-Hidayah Islamic Foundation, Shaykh Qamardeen Akorede and Mudiru Mahdul Munawwarah, Ustadh AbdulWaheed AbdulAzeez gave the advice during the 12th Ramadan Lecture organised by the Unified Local Government Muslim (Staff) Association in Lagos. The event was in conjunction with the Isolo Local Council Development Area. Shaykh Akorede told the workers to ensure they are not found wanting in line of their duties. “You are employed for a purpose, do it diligently,” he said. He warned them against wasting time on frivolities. Ustadh AbdulAzeez cautioned political leaders against making promises they cannot fulfil. According to him, many politicians are in the habit of deceiving the electorate. He warned them to fear Allah and be ready to account for their actions on the day of judgement. The Amir of the association, Alhaji Yakeen Sofiyullahi Lawal, urged the council workers to always resume to the office and close as at when due. Alhaji Lawal urged them to be conscious of time in whatever they do. Isolo LCDA Chairman Shamsudeen Olaleye told the workers to always be dedicated and loyal to the government paying their salaries. “We expect that they should show more responsiveness and discharge their duties in line with the laid down procedures,” he said. House of Representatives-elect Ganiyu Johnson called for love among the council workers. Johnson said they should avoid bickering on issues they can overlook for themselves.
