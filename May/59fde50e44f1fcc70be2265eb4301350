The Chairman, Coalition of Federated Association and Capital Territory Tricycle and Motorcycle Riders, Dealers and Operators, Comrade Thomas Ali Danjuma  yesterday lamented the influx of substandard tricycles (kown in common parlance as Keke) into the country. He alleged that the first batch of Keke that  was brought into the country   by DAG was good, stressing that the distributor and manufacturer have been pouring substandard Keke into the country. He spoke in Abuja, lamenting that even though the distributor and the manufacturer gave one year warranty, they have not kept to their promise. He said: “DAG in partnership with Indian manufacturing firm manufacture of Keke, they have their agents all over Nigeria; the first batch of Keke was very good and durable but subsequently they started refurbishing and repackaging old keke to Nigeria market.” But DAG chief, Mr. Fildous Ahmad Ahmad, said he is  unaware that the firm is flooding the local market with substandard Keke.  He assured The Nation that he will speak with Comrade Danjuma  and get back.
