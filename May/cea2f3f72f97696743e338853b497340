To commemorate the 2019 Lafarge Global Health and Safety Days and as part of its Sustainability strategy 2030, Lafarge Africa, in partnership with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos State Blood Transfusion Services and Rotary Club of Lagos, has delivered a health and safety sensitization programme for motorists. Lafarge Africa and FRSC urged motorists in Nigeria to ensure that they are aware of health and safety procedures as this would further reduce road accidents, even as the current data from the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) show a marginal decline in the number of road accidents in the country. The Head of Safety, Health and Environment for Lafarge Africa, Mrs. Folake Odegbami alluded to this at the joint health and safety campaign programme held recently for members of the National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW) at Ojota Motor Park in Lagos state. Odegbami stated that Lafarge’s commitment to Health and Safety informed the company’s decision to collaborate with critical organizations focused on improved safety across the country. According to the January 2019 Road Traffic Crash (RTC) Report by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), a total of 540 fatalities occurred, while 3,383 were injured following 950 road traffic incidents across Nigeria in January 2019.
