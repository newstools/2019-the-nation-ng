Let’s face the reality. Pimples can be so annoying and frustrating. They get all up in your face, ruin it and then refuse to leave your face and make your face look absurd. As if that is not enough, they are very hard to get rid of and some recommended products still won’t do anything but cost you a lot of money. Here are some tips that would help you reduce it drastically: Procedures: 1: Boil water (two cups of water to be precise) 2: Steep green tea into the boiling water for 3-4 minutes. If you are faithful with it for two weeks, the pimples on your face would reduce. 2. Use Aloe Vera and toothpaste This is another homemade method to get rid of pimples. You can use Aloe Vera with other treatment not necessarily toothpaste, When you apply Aloe Vera with toothpaste allow it to stay for like 5 minutes then wash off your face this does not need a lot of stress and it works also. Use it three times a week. Generally because of the sweats during the long run of the day some might have used their hands to wipe off the sweats away from their face and who knows that hand they used might have germs. That is why it is very essential to wash your face at nights and apply cleanser 5: Don’t apply every cream you come across on your face. Just because it is working for somebody does not mean it would definitely work for you. We are human beings and we sure have differences in our body system and growth. Be very careful of the cream you apply to your face in order not to add to the ones on your face.
