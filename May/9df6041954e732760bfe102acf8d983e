US-based Afro-pop singer and songwriter, Oluwafemi Benson Giwa, who is simply known as Brite Benson has returned with the official music video of his single, ‘Sokoyokoto’. The video, which was shot in Lagos and the US by Adams Gud, tells a love story of Brite Benson and also had Cameroon singer Adele Clarice featured on it as remix. Recall that the ‘Local Boy’ crooner caught the attention of music lovers when he performed  ‘Sokoyokoto’ as a snippet at the just concluded Access Bank Lagos City Marathon held in Lagos. Benson became prominent in 2017 when he dropped the single titled, ‘Slay Mama.’ Since then he has continued to grow and make several appearances on big stages both locally and internationally. His hit song titled, ‘One way’ featuring indigenous rapper, CDQ is still getting buzz on the radio, TV and streets. Benson is set to kick-off his media tour across the states, next month. According to the Media Director of BBLB Organization, Olatoye Olawale, he is confident that Brite Benson aka Local Boy has the ability to rule the Nigerian music industry. “Local Boy is an all-round entertainer,” said Olawale. “Apart from the music that many people know him for, he’s also an actor and performer.”
