Manchester United’s top-four hopes came to an end in disappointing fashion as they were held to a draw at relegated Huddersfield. The Terriers had managed just four points in their previous 23 games but watched by outgoing chairman Dean Hoyle, earned a share of the spoils as Isaac Mbenza’s first goal for the club levelled Scott McTominay’s first-half effort. In a frantic finish, young United substitute Tahith Chong had a shot saved and Paul Pogba hit the bar before David de Gea denied Karlan Grant a winner at the other end. It means United have now gone five games without a win, their worst sequence since they went eight games without a victory under Louis van Gaal between November and December 2015. The result means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side cannot catch either Chelsea or Tottenham and have only a slim chance of finishing above Arsenal in fifth. Alexis Sanchez is also a major doubt for the final game of the season against Cardiff at Old Trafford, having limped straight down the tunnel after suffering an injury at the start of the second half. Huddersfield are 11 points adrift at the bottom of the table and finish their season at Southampton next Sunday. United remain sixth and entertain Cardiff. (BBCSports)
