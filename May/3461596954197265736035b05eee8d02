An application by Mr. Blessing Agbomhere, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the recount of ballot papers used for the election into Etsako Federal Constituency was rejected by the National and State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal. Agbomhere is challenging the declaration of Hon Johnson Oghuma of the All Progressives Congress as winner of the election. İn the application filed by Counsel of Agbomere, Chika Adindu, the PDP candidate requested for recounting and fingerprint assessment of the ballot papers used for the poll. But Chairman of the tribunal, Justice O. Ogundana, declined the plea petitioners and ruled that there was no provision in the electoral act as amended that provides​ for recount after declaration of result. “At the place of voting, the polling officers can allow the agents to count. “Recounting and fingerprint assessment does not have any correlation with errors or miscalculation, as a result, the application lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. The Tribunal subsequently announced June 11 for the commencement of substantive hearing on the petition.
