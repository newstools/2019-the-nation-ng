Manchester City defeated Leicester City 1-0 on Monday to regain the Premier League leadership from Liverpool and stretch the title race to the final day of the season on Sunday. City scraped the win, thanks to an incredible second-half goal by Vincent Kompany, which broke Leicester City’s resistance at Etihad Stadium, in a match watched by an estimated 54,506 people. After Liverpool bounced to the top of the league table on Saturday after beating a stubborn Newcastle United, City badly needed a win to regain the top of the table. Man City’s first clear opening came on 32 minutes when Sergio Aguero’s header was brilliantly clawed off the line by Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel after it hit the woodwork. Ilkay Gundogan twice went close either side of half-time, before Leroy Sane’s introduction gave fresh impetus to the defending champions. Aguero was denied superbly by Schmeichel again before Kompany hammered a 25-yard shot into the top corner on 70 minutes. Former Man City striker Kelechi Iheanacho spurned a great opportunity to level for Leicester, but Man City held on to go top on 95 points, one point above Liverpool with one match left. Leicester City stay ninth on 51 points. Manchester City would next meet Brighton & Hove Albion at the American Express Community Stadium on Sunday, the final day of the 38-match league, while Liverpool would host Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield.
