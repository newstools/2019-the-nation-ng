Are you planning to move out of Nigeria? Planning a trip abroad can be really stressful. So imagine how it must feel when you’re planning on moving permanently and leaving your home behind. Here are the top 5 things you must do before you pack up and move to another country: When you move to another country, you’d need to have a lot of cash especially because you never know when you’re going to get a job. I would suggest you start saving up months (preferably a year) before you make that big move in order to avoid ending up broke or in debts. Another way to avoid being broke within your first few months in your new place of residence is to get a job. You could do that by looking through options in your field online or getting in touch with firms that have openings you can apply for. And if you do not get a job offer that is remotely similar to your field, worry not. You just need to get enough cash to get on your feet properly. By doing so, you can save yourself the trouble of familiarising yourself with the environment, people, culture and every other important factor that could lead you to change your decision on moving there. This could be a temporary residency, permanent residency, work, business, a tourist visa, or a variety of others. Also, if your passport is about to expire, you need to go ahead and renew it. It would save you time and money to fly back home to do so. Before jet-setting off to your next big destination, take a few extra steps to make sure you can access your funds. This is important because some countries make it difficult to pay for things with foreign cards. There are really easy ways to get an international debit or credit card.
