Robbers operating near Okada junction on the Benin-Lagos highway have killed a lecturer with the Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State, identified as Kelvin Izebeokhai. It was learnt that the robbers abducted other passengers in the bus the deceased was travelling in. The driver was said to have escaped into the bush with four passengers. Spokesman for the university Mr. Jide Ilugbo, who confirmed the killing, described it as barbaric. He said the late Kelvin was a first-class graduate and was employed by the university three years ago. Ilugbo said: “It is now dangerous to travel along the Benin-Lagos highway due to frequent robberies. “It was unfortunate that the deceased ran into the robbers. A trailer parked before Okada junction is a hideout for criminals.” Police Commissioner Mr. Mohammed DanMallam confirmed the abduction and the death of the lecturer. He said Kelvin was killed by the robbers when he attempted to escape when the victims were being taken into the forest. “Unfortunately, one of the passengers, who tried to escape during the abduction, was killed by the gunmen. The police went after the kidnappers in the bush and rescued the victims,” DanMallam said. He said the police were working on a new strategy, which entails taking the war to the kidnappers’ den in the jungle, adding that it is the best way to tackle the incessant robberies.
