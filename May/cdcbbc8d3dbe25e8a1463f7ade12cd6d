The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will on Monday arraign a musician, Azeez Fashola, alias Naira Marley at the Federal High Court in Lagos for alleged online fraud, popularly known as Yahoo Yahoo. The EFCC filed an 11-count charge of alleged credit card fraud against Fashola on the 14th of May in a suit marked FHC/L/178C/19. Some of the credit cards, according to the EFCC, bore the names- Nicole Louise Malyon, and Timea Fedorne Tatar. The agency said the alleged crimes contravened the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act. The charges read in part, “That you, Azeez Adeshina Fashola, aka Naira Marley, and Raze (still at large), on or about the 11th day of December 2018, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, conspired amongst yourselves to use Access card 42658840359191132 issued to persons other than you in a bid to obtain gain and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 27(1)(b) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act 2015 and punishable under Section 33(2) of the Same Act. “That you, Azeez Adeshina Fashola, aka Naira Marley, and Raze (still at large), on or about the 10th day of May 2019, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to defraud possessed, counterfeit card 4921819410257431 issued to Timea Fedorne Tatar and you thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 33(9) of Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act 2015.” The artiste has been under fire recently following his open support for online fraud commonly called ‘Yahoo Yahoo.’ He was arrested last Friday along with four others, including his friend and fellow artiste, Zlatan Ibile.
