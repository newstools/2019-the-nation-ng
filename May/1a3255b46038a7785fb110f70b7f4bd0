The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised motorists plying the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to use alternative routes due to ongoing rehabilitation work. Corps Public Education Officer, Mr Bisi Kazeem, gave the advice in a statement in Abuja on Saturday. ” This is due to the ongoing rehabilitation work on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has necessitated the construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria PLC, to erect barriers around the Magboro area of the corridor, to enable them lay asphalt on that stretch of the road. “This has further narrowed lanes and diversions available to traffic but the action are to allow the freshly laid asphalt dry off, hopefully by Sunday, May 12 when the additional barriers would be removed. “This particular action has been responsible for traffic build up on both sections of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, around Ibafo/Magboro to Long Bridge of the corridor. “To this end, the FRSC wishes to advise the motoring public to exercise patience while using the corridor during this period and avoid driving against traffic,” Kazeem said. He further advised motorists to use alternative routes to avoid unnecessary delay. These routes include Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta, Ajah-Epe-Ijebu-Ode, and Ikorodu-Ijebu-Ode. “The FRSC is warning motorists to refrain from driving against traffic as those apprehended would be booked for dangerous driving which attracts fines of N50,000. “FRSC personnel are complemented by sister traffic and military personnel to manage the traffic situation,” he said.
