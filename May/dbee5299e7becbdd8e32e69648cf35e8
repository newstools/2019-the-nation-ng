PARENTS must show keen interest in the company their children keep, to prevent them from getting involved in drug abuse, Lagos State Youth and Social Development Commissioner Agboola Dabiri said yesterday. Speaking at the ministry’s party to mark Children’s Day at the Agege Stadium, Dabiri said parents must ensure that their children did not use  tobacco, alcohol and drugs. The children had fun as they engaged in face painting, bouncing castle and dancing competition, among other games. They received gifts of lunch boxes, school bags, food and drinks. Dabiri said the event, with the theme: “Drug abuse among children, addressing the challenges”, was a reminder to parents that their children’s safety is their primary responsibility. Drug abuse prevention, he said, started with parents learning how to talk to their children about difficult topics, adding : “Protecting children from drug abuse is a shared responsibility; it cannot be done in isolation by the school, parents or government. We must work together to make sure drug abuse becomes historical references and not present day reality. “This celebration is also to remind us of the need to renew our commitment towards children’s welfare, to understand, appreciate and celebrate the importance of childhood and include children in nation building’’, the commissioner said. The Permanent Secretary, Dr. Bola Balogun, said preventing children from drug and alcohol abuse would improve their quality of life and overall development. She enjoined all to cooperate with the government in its effort to make the environment friendly and drug free.
