Jurgen Klopp says his players are ready to go through the pain for one last time as they aim to end Liverpool’s three-decade wait to become Champions of England. He has had a number of injury worries during the week, with Andrew Robertson and Jordan Henderson coming out of the Barcelona game with some issues, while Mohamed Salah has not yet started training after being left concussed at Newcastle last Saturday. All three men, however, are expected to be in the line-up when Wolves come to Anfield and all Liverpool can do as they seek to dislodge Pep Guardiola’s team is get the three points they need. ”The famous three words of this week in the dressing room is: it’s only pain. Very important for all the young lads to learn. Hendo said “it’s only pain”, Robbo said “it’s only pain” but it was real pain! Wow! Robbo could deal with the pain but he could not activate the muscle. ”They should be fine. Bobby (Firmino)? Not for the weekend. But we have enough time (for the final). Mo looked good around the celebrations, and yesterday and the day before he was running outside. Today (Friday) he will join in training.” Klopp was rather less forthcoming, however, when asked whether this Sunday could be Daniel Sturridge and Alberto Moreno’s final home game for the club. ”I don’t know, we will see. Both are out of contract? It’s possible, but we will see,” Klopp added.
