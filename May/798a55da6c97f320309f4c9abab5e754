Residents of Ogodo Valley in Mende, Maryland area of Lagos State, were thrown into panic on Sunday night as gunmen suspected to be cultists killed one and injured two children on the streets. Eyewitnesses told The Nation that the victim, simply identified as Dare Atlanta, who sells Indian hemp, was hanging out with his friends in the Valley when he received a phone call from his soon-to-be killers posing as customers around 9pm. The victim then climbed up to Atiba Osbourne Street to meet them where he was immediately shot in the head. In a bid to escape, the killers, numbering four, started shooting sporadically, injuring a boy and a girl who were hit by stray bullets. The body of the victim was evacuated by a police patrol team from Anthony Police Division and an officer, pleading anonymity, said investigation was underway to establish the motive behind the killing. He added that efforts were on to apprehend the killers. A resident said that the killing might have be connected to a recent clash between groups from Mende and Ojota.
