Lagos State was created in 1967. Between then and now, it has produced 14 governors. Today, Babajide Sanwo-Olu will be the 15th governor, following his inauguration. Group Political Editor EMMANUEL OLADESU profiles the governors. In 52 years, Lagos State has produced 15 governors; nine military rulers and six civilians. Historically, both during military and civilian regimes, the governors have been role models among their colleagues from other states of the federation.  Brig-Gen.
