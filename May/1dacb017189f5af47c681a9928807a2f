AN Immigration officer, Emeka Francis, 38, was yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly impersonating an Interpol officer and defrauding a traveller of N3.99 million. Prosecuting Sergeant Oluwabunmi Adeitan alleged that the defendant collected the money from Christopher Menkiti on February 19 at 12:35pm at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos. She said a National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) official accosted the complainant and handed him over to a group of men claiming to be Interpol officers, who searched his luggage. Adeitan alleged that the defendant seized the complainant’s travel documents and refused to give him back. The documents were returned after the complaint gave the defendant the N3.99 million. She said the complainant, who was held hostage for four hours, called his mother, who transferred the cash to the defendant’s  two accounts. The prosecution named the accounts as Francis Emeka Eze, Zenith Bank, account no. 2081979756 and Francis Emeka Eze, First Bank, account no.2015859273. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate T.A. Ojo granted him N500, 000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. The sureties, she said,  must be employed and produce evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Ojo said the sureties must be relatives of the defendant and live within the court’s jurisdiction. The case continues on June 18.
