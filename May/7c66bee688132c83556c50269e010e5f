Mr. Seyi Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been sworn in as the 28th Governor of Oyo State. Makinde took his oath of office and oath of allegiance at about 12: 22pm in company of his wife, Omini and three children. Part of the swearing saw balloons decorated in the red, green and white colors of the umbrella party, PDP released into the air, immediately the governor completed taking the oath of office. Technical issues also saw the Governor delayed for about five minutes before taking the oath as he was made to sit down alongside the CJ before the issue was resolved. The oath was administered by the Chief Judge, Munta Abimbola. The deputy governor, Mr. Rauf Olaniyan, took the oath also in the company of immediate family members including wife and children. The ongoing swearing in however saw a mild drama amongst other things as some police officers harassed some journalists who were on hand to do their job. The armed police officers, dressed in camouflage, charged on the journalists standing around a mounted camera stand of the State-owned broadcasting outfit, Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS) to monitor proceedings. They also verbally assaulted the journalists, including The Nationâ€™s Newspapers correspondent, Yinka Adeniran, claiming to be clearing the crowd from the centre of the main bowl of the stadium. The development led to hot exchanges between the journalists and police officers. It took the intervention of unassuming, senior police officers after their inferiors insisted on chasing away everyone by the stand, including journalists who showed their accreditation tags and office identity cards to save the day. The event was marred by poor crowd control mechanism and technical issues, which led to the commuters and road users around the Liberty Road stranded.
