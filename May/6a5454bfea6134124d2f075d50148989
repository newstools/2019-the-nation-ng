Vincent Kompany is to become the player-manager of Anderlecht after confirming his departure from Manchester City. The City captain revealed he was leaving the club after 11 years on Sunday, a day after a 6-0 win over Watford in the FA Cup final saw them become the first English men’s club to secure the domestic treble. Kompany has now unveiled his plans for the future; he has signed a three-year deal with Belgian side Anderlecht, where he came through the ranks before joining Hamburg in 2006. The 33-year-old explained his decision on Facebook, writing: “I have decided to take up the challenge at RSC Anderlecht. Player-Manager. “I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations. With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium. “This may come as a surprise to you. It’s the most passionate yet rational decision I’ve ever made. “As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club. A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none.”  SkySports
