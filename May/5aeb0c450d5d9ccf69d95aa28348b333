EKITI State Governor Kayode Fayemi has felicitated with President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on their inauguration for a second term today. He said he was convinced that Nigerians would witness a higher level of growth in the next four years. Fayemi also congratulated his colleague-governors, returning and newly elected, who were inaugurated in 29 states. The governor, in a congratulatory message, described yesterday’s inauguration of the President and the governors as a positive development and a demonstration of the collective wishes of the Nigerian people for the entrenchment of democracy. Fayemi, who last week assumed office as chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), also congratulated Nigerians on 20 years of unbroken democratic governance, saying that the milestone was achieved by sheer determination of the Nigerian people to make democracy work, in spite of inherent challenges. “Today is significant in so many ways. The President and the Vice President are taking oath of office for a second term in office, just as returning and newly elected governors are being inaugurated in 29 states. This has been the tradition since 1999. “As a people, we have every reason to be happy today as we witness 20 years of unbroken democratic governance in our country. We owe this to the commitment and determination of the Nigerian people, who have come to see democracy as the most viable option,” he said.”
