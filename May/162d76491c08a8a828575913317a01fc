The sit-at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was a complete failure in Enugu. Business and other social activities were going on as usual in every part of the state. All the markets, offices and banks were fully in operation without any molestations. All the schools, with the exception of the Catholic schools which are observing the Ascension Day, were all in session. Security operatives were seen parading major roads and mounting surveillance in strategic places, in the event of any outbreak of crisis. The only security threat noticed was the one posed by JSS 1 pupils of secondary schools who were celebrating the conclusion of their final examination on Thursday. The pupils were using teargas and other dangerous weapons against each other while the police chased and arrested some of them.
