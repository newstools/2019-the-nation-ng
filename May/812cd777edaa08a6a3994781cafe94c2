In its quest to prepare the D’Tigers for the 2019 FIBA Men’s World Cup, the Nigeria Basketball Federation has lined up grade-A friendlies against the Dominican Republic and Canada ahead of the World Cup. D’Tigers’ two-legged encounter against the Dominican Republic will take place in Santo Domingo between July 19th and 25th before playing Canada in Quebec and Ontario between August 5th and 11th 2019. According to arrangements put in place for the team, D’Tigers will open camp in the United States of America before moving to Canada. Lagos, Nigeria will be the venue of the final phase of preparation with NBBF already in advanced talks with a yet to be named World Cup-bound team for a 2-legged friendly. NBBF President, Engr. Musa Kida disclosed that the Federation is determined to give the team the best preparation that it can afford to ensure that the team does the nation proud in China when the World cup starts on the 31st of August. “We have locked down 2 grade A games with the Dominican Republic and Canada who will both be at the World Cup. These games alongside those we are still planning to organize when the team comes to Lagos, we believe, will provide quality tests for the team.” Kida revealed that though the choices of camp sites in the USA and Canada have not been made due to factors such as quality of facilities, playing personnel and most importantly funds, agreements have been concluded with the Canadian and Dominican Republic Basketball Federations for the games. Meanwhile, the team is also billed to participate in a friendly tournament featuring some teams that will take part in the mundial in China between 21st and 26th of August.
