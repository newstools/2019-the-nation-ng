IDOL Records new signee, Ebenezer Adeboye, who prefers to be called Lese, is upbeat about his new single which he believes would hit the industry when he drops it. Keen on collaborations, Lese was recently in the studio with songtress Teni Entertainer and he described their collaboration as spiritual. He also hinted that there could be more than one collaborations even before the end of the second quarter. “The vision is to keep working hard and looking at how to explore new opportunities that may arise,” said Lese who describes his music as Afro-infusion “From my end, I strongly feel I am ready for the challenge and I have got what it takes but if my management could still set new collaborations, I will be willing to jump on it. Since Idol Records came on board, the story has changed for good. I am not relaxing because Idol got my back, I like to keep pushing myself and play my part of the deal well. Hopefully, we will all be happy.”
