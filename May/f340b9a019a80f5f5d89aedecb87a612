The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has said the planned week-long retreat for governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, is contemptuous of Nigerians. The group accused the governors and their retinue of personal aides of diverting hundreds of millions of naira in hard currency to massage their ego at the expense of those who voted them into office. It said the electorate expects the governors-elect to provide potable water, smooth roads and pay pension arrears to senior citizens. But BMO noted that the governors-elect are also to use their states’ resources to provide basic amenities, especially schools that are conducive for teaching and learning. A statement by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsuji and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, said the retreat that will hold at one of the costliest hotels in Dubai is wasteful and shows that the PDP governors and governors-elect have no confidence in Nigeria’s hospitality industry, which employs millions of people. The statement said: “This is a further exhibition of PDP’s profligacy and wastefulness. Are there no worthy places for meeting in Nigeria? We, therefore, call on the PDP to look inward at all times and for once be patriotic. “Information indicates that the PDP crowd, prodded by their unsuccessful presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, has taken up a large chunk of the 599 luxurious ocean view rooms and suites and an additional 19 beachside villas in the complex.” The BMO regretted that even outgoing PDP governors, some of whom have cases at election petitions tribunals, planned to travel to Dubai for the retreat, instead of staying at home to take stock of their activities and prepare handing over notes for in-coming governors.
