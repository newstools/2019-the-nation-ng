The Federal Government has completed the construction of box culverts, but retained the Sarius Palmetum Botanical Garden wall  in Maitama, Abuja, to check flooding and erosion within the garden and its environs. The project, which was carried out through the Ecological Fund Office (EFO), included stone pitching and de-silting of drain. Speaking at the inuaguration and handing over of the projects to the management of the garden, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello said the project was expected to check flooding and erosion, as well as further degradation of the environment. He said the age-long problem of gully erosion and flooding in the country could not be over emphasised. “I have no doubt that this Federal Government’s intervention will bring a huge relief to the large patrons of the garden,” he said. Having successfully completed the project, he said, there was no doubt that the economic benefits of the botanical garden and its environs would be greatly boosted. “This will at the same time reduce danger to lives and property associated with erosion and persistent flooding that are in and around the garden,” he said.
