Anchor University, Lagos (AUL), has praised one of her illustrious faculty members, Dr Olawale Awe of the Department of Mathematical Sciences, for his appointment as a “LISA 2020 Engagement Ambassador” in recognition of his contributions to LISA 2020 programme. The Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA) is driven by the vision to, by the year 2020, build adequate statistical analysis and data science capacity in developing countries. The vision is being driven through the creation of statistics and data science collaboration laboratories at universities and institutions, training of statisticians and data scientists, provide support for research and innovation to improve statistical skills and data literacy. By his appointment, the statistician and data scientist, who was also the first LISA Fellow in 2013, has now been charged with the task of driving the vision of LISA 2020 across Africa. In the coming weeks, Awe will be visiting various institutions across the continent to train researchers and statisticians in a drive to fulfil the LISA 2020 vision. Awe is confident about what his new role entails. He said: “Having been a part of the programme for the last few years, I understand the mandate and the challenges that come with this appointment. And, as usual, I am looking forward to using the opportunity to engage researchers, train statisticians and promote data and statistical engagement and practices across Africa.” Before joining Anchor University, where he was instrumental to the establishment of the Anchor University Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Science and Data Analysis (AULISSDA), Awe was the coordinator and founder of Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis and Collaboration (LISAC) at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife where he was a lecturer.
