Men of the Nigeria Navy Ship (NNS) Victory in Calabar, Cross River State, have arrested five Nigerians and three Cameroonians for allegedly attempting to smuggle out 105 drums of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS), popularly called petrol, to Cameroon. Commander NNS Victory, Commodore Vincent Okeke, who addressed reporters at their jetty in Calabar, said the product, worth about N6 million, was gotten from Oron in Akwa Ibom State. He said the matter was still under investigation. Okeke, who also handed over 357 bags of contraband rice worth N7 million and six suspects to the Nigeria Customs Service, said they would not relent in ensuring that smugglers were driven out of business. “We are handing over the rice to the Customs today. The PMS and suspects are undergoing investigation. We will hand over when we finish the investigation. We will not give up. We will make sure we run them out of business. The negative effects of their activities are many. “The rice they are importing is killing agriculture in this country. The Federal Government’s efforts to diversify the economy are being sabotaged. On the issue of the PMS, the government brings in PMS at a subsidised rate for the public, meanwhile some people are still taking out this PMS to neigbouring countries. You can now understand why nobody can comprehend the daily consumption rate being put out. It is obvious that this product is being smuggled out of the country. So it my duty to make sure this is curtailed forthwith. They must desist. They have to look for legitimate businesses to do. This is the message to them,” he said.
