The BÃ©nin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) has dismissed allegation that it bribed lawmakers in the Edo State House of Assembly with N50m for the bill criminalizing electricity theft to be passed. It said the Edo State House of Assembly only followed what Ekiti State did in domesticating and existing federal law which prescribed 21 years for anyone caught stealing electricity. The bill waiting for the assent of Governor Godwin Obaseki stipulated three years jail term for anybody that engaged in electricity theft. It also prescribed a special court for electricity consumers in the who bypass and engage in illegal connection. Managing Director of BEDC, Mrs. Funky Osibodu, who spoke at a media parley said the bill was in line with anti-corruption war. Speaker of the Edo Assembly, Hon Kabiru Adjoto, who also denied the allegation, said he would institute legal action against some members of the Edo Stats Civil Society group.
