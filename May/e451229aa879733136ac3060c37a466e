The Chairman of the Badagry local government, Hon Olusegun Onilude, has reiterated his commitment to bring back the lost glory of the local government area in the socio-economic and political development. He gave this assurance during the foundation-laying ceremony of the new Badagry multipurpose and customary court halls which took place at the old Badagry customary court site. Onilude said:” Our administration has remained resolute in bringing back the glorious days of our dear local government area. This is a promise we made to the people of this local government area and to which we are committed. For the first time since democracy returned to our country, a local government administration has decided to site a major project in Badagry town. We are proud this is a positive history that will be described as one of the legacies of this administration.” He noted that that the local government was making history towards making a giant stride in the aesthetic development of Badagry with the laying of the foundation for the proposed storey building that will house a multi -purpose hall, a customary court hall, 12 offices, 10 toilets and a mini hall for meetings and conferences that will be completed within one year for commissioning. The council boss said barely two years of his administration in office, his team had been able to make a positive impact on the lives of the people of the area in social, economic and infrastructural development such as the construction of Ajido Town Hall, Ajido Youth Centre, construction of Agankameh Road, rehabilitation of palace and Hospital Roads, patching of Agric and Joseph Dosu roads, reconstruction of Badagry Local Government Skills Acquisition Centre, construction of open stalls at Ikoga Market, construction of a block of classrooms at L. A. Primary School, Keta-West Gberefu, and execution of empowerment programmes to enhance the economic potential of the people of the local government area towards self-sufficiency.
