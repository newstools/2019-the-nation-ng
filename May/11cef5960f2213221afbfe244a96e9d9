Suspected armed bandits were on Thursday arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command. It was learnt that they were fond of robbing bank customers especially in Akure, the state capital. Sources said one of the suspects was arrested on Tuesday after stealing a sum of N500, 000 from a building contractor’s car at Ayedun quarters, Akure, shortly after he had collected the money from the bank. The hoodlums were said to have accosted the contractor from the bank to the area where he parked his car. It was learnt that after breaking into the car, they took the money and in an attempt to flee, they hit a commercial motorcyclist who forced them to stop. Policemen from the state Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) were said to have been invited to the scene and arrested one of the suspected robbers. Sources said the arrest of the suspect had led to the arrest of other two suspects who were allegedly members of the same robbery gang. The suspects had confessed to be involving in the robbery of bank customers. One of them was said to have affirmed that he robbed and killed the bursar of the Anglican Church (Mr. Gabriel Abiodun) in one of their operations few months ago. The Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Mr. Femi Joseph confirmed the development and said the command was on the trail of other fleeing suspects. According to him, four of them had been arrested and would be paraded next week, stressing that efforts were on to arrest the remaining gangsters.
