Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has appointed a former commissioner, Ahmad Bashir, as the Secretary to the State Government (SSG). He has also appointed a broadcaster, Solomon Kumangar, as the Director of Press; as well as another broadcaster, George Kushir, as the Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Sett Crowther. The appointments, the first to be made by the governor after his inauguration on Wednesday, take immediate effect. Bashir was the Commissioner for Works and Housing during the three months that Fintiri acted as governor in 2014. Kumangar, is a broadcaster with the Adamawa Television (ATV), where he rose to become the Director of News. Kushir is a Yola-based reporter with the AIT. Swearing in the SSG yesterday, Fintiri told him that his choice as the SSG was informed by his record of integrity and urged him to continue in that light. The new SSG said fixing Adamawa would require tough decisions that might be unpopular with some people, but that he was not afraid in hurting some people for the overall good of the state.
