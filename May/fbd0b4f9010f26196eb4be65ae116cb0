ALMOST  two months after she was kidnapped at the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) regional headquarters in Agege, a  two-year-old girl was yesterday rescued in Igando by the police. Igando Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Taiwo Kasunmu, a Chief Superintendent (CSP),  led the operation to rescue Baby Esther Ojo from the kidnappers’ den. The duo of Nwaigbo Magnus and Sixtus Osunwoke Egwim, who were waiting to collect ransom from the baby’s parents at a fixed location, were arrested during the operation. It was gathered that the police had been on the kidnappers’ trail since they established contact with Mr. and Mrs. Oladipo Ojo. The Nation learnt that the suspects gave them six locations to take the ransom to before settling for the place they were arrested. They were said to have changed the locations many times to avoid falling into police. But they were outsmarted by the police, which  nabbed them around 12:30pm yesterday. It was gathered that they led the police to their den where the baby was rescued and handed over to her parents. The baby’s father, who could not hold back tears, said her rescue had restored his faith  in the police. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), said the operation lasted over four hours. He said: “The Commissioner of Police has hailed the DPO of Igando and his team for busting the gang. This operation to arrest the suspects today lasted over four hours. “The police acted on credible intelligence and led plain-clothes surveillance men on the trail of the suspected kidnappers. “They had already demanded ransom of undisclosed amount from the parents of the baby and the church. They continued to change the venue for the collection of ransom within Igando axis for over four hours until they were rounded up by the police. “This is in furtherance of the commitment of the Lagos State Police Command to ensure a crime-free Lagos that will be safe for all,” he said.
