Chairman, FBNQuest Merchant Bank, Bello Maccido,  has hinted on the company’s strategic direction for the 2019 fiscal year. He spoke during the fourth Annual General Meeting of the company held in Lagos. Its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Kayode Akinkugbe, during the event, also highlighted the challenges and gains in the 2018 financial year. Akinkugbe revealed that in 2018 FBNQuest Merchant Bank faced strong headwinds, characterised by contracting interest spreads, a sluggish investment banking market with fewer financing and advisory transactions, and increased competition. “Despite the challenging business environment we achieved a respectable financial performance in 2018, and remain committed to adding value to our stakeholders by delivering a superior customer experience and strong returns”. The FBNQuest business group maintained profitability and recorded steady growth in some of its business lines. Total revenue increased by 8.6 per cent year-on-year to N40.96 billion from N37.72 billion in Dec 2017, while profit before tax grew by 56.2 per cent year-on-year to N16.4 billion from N10.5 billion in Dec 2017. The main contributors were the Asset Management, Corporate Banking, Trustees and Fixed Income, Currencies and Trading (FICT) businesses. This again demonstrates the resilient and diversified nature of the business portfolio. Assets under management (AuM) across the group (FBNQuest Asset Management and FBNQuest Trustees) increased by five per cent to close at N261 billion (Dec 2017: N248.5 billion).
