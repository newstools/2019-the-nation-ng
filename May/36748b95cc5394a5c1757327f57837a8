Dupuis told local media: “With Ajorque the situation is very simple. When I contacted him he was very clear that this is his first season in Ligue 1 with Strasbourg, so he basically wanted to focus on his club. “I perfectly understand this and I have no intention to disrupt that by making another approach. “He is an intelligent boy, who has not closed the door on Madagascar for the future. He knows what he is doing and I really wish him the very best.” Debutantes Madagascar will face Nigeria, Burundi and Guinea in Group B and tournament will take place from June 21 to July 19.
