Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday chaired the valedictory session for the National Economic Council (NEC). Many of the State governors were attending the meeting for the last time as their tenures expire on the 29th of May, 2019. The meeting, which started around 11.05am, went into closed doors immediately after opening prayer by the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong and rendition of the National anthem. Journalists will be invited in for the valedictory proper.
