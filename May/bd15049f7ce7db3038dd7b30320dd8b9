Spokesman for the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Southwest Erondu Uche has warned against unnecessary debate on tribal superiority. In a statement yesterday, Uche said: “It is important to note that Igbo know their origin, likewise the Yoruba and other tribes and ethnic groups in Africa. It is wrong for any tribe to claim superiority of knowledge of origin of another tribe more than the tribe in question. “In the school of knowledge, no man is an island. What your father told you about my father would definitely differ from my father’s story about himself and his story is the truth. “Many scholars have written about the origin of the Igbo race. Some agree with each other while some disagree, but to an extent, one can see a great similarity in all. Each scholar or researcher writes based on data accessed. Most of the published materials on Igbo origin lack truth. The resultant effect is that those who read these fake materials are mislead. “Another problem is the incomplete stories told by some old men, most of whom were and are traditional rulers. Old age or title cannot be a determinant for truth, an old man or title holder who posses incomplete story would mislead his audience. Almost all reactions, comments and publications made on this subject within the last few weeks are based on these fallible sources. “I, therefore, advice all Igbo to stop all form of publications regarding this subject matter. Igbo know their origin. To politicians who have hijacked this debate to further deprive Igbo their due leadership positions at the national level, I urge you to desist from rewriting Igbo history to avoid the wrath of the gods. “No doubt, Igbo and Yoruba are closely related, and the two tribes know their root. No tribe in the world can tell the origin of another tribe more than the tribe in focus.”
