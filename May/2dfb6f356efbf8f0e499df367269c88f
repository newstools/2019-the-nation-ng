PenCom has constituted a new four-man interim management committee with Mr. Ivor Takor as the Chairman. The report read: “During the period under review, Unico CPFA Limited relinquished its operational licence and exited the pension business. This was due to the decision of the sponsor, UACN PLC, to discontinue the scheme. Consequently, the CPFA has wound-up its pension plans and transferred the funds into the RSAs of all its members with PFAs of their choice. “The Commission continued its regulatory intervention on First Guarantee Pension Limited. However, a new four-man interim Management Committee was constituted by the Commission with Mr. Ivor M. Takor as the Chairman. “The PFA continued to provide services to its clients with a satisfactory solvency and going concern status. The Commission continued its efforts to ensure expeditious resolution of the shareholders’ dispute in the PFA with a view to ending the regulatory intervention.’’ The report added that First City Monument Bank (FCMB), a shareholder of Legacy Pension Managers Limited, has acquired majority shares in the PFA.
