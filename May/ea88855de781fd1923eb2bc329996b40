OGUN State Governor-elect Prince Dapo Abiodun yesterday pledged to “submit himself to the will of the people and agenda of the state” when sworn-in on May 29 next week as next executive governor. Abiodun also assured that he would be “humble” in governance, saying since “humility” has taken him far in life, there would be no reason to change when he is in power. The successful entrepreneur and oil magnate gave the assurance in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, in an apparent response to the remarks by Nigerian businessman and politician, Afolabi Adeola, during Abiodun’s pre-inauguration lecture. Adeola, who was the chairman of the occasion, had lamented that politicians while seeking the  people’s votes, always wear the garb of humility and which tends to make the citizens have feeling of a new dawn. But, he said once such politicians were elected and sworn-in, the whole thing turned to an illusion. The co-founders of Guaranty Trust Bank(GTB) said Abiodun ran a difficult race and emerged victorious, advising him not to toe the path of others, who would set up committee after committee only to treat the recommendations of such committees with disdain. He also advised the governor-elect to “submit himself” and his “cronies” to the agenda of the state and interest of the people. However, Abiodun said that his administration would be different.
