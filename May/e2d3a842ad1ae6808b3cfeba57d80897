THE Students’Union of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University (IBBUL), Lapai, Niger State has suspended its Financial Secretary indefinitely. Comrade Yahaya Umar Faruk (Aluta mayo) was suspended for alleged misappropriation of funds and misconduct. The Students’ Representative Assembly (SRA) Speaker, Abdurahman Sadiq, made this known through the Clerk, Usman Isah Ndanusa. The allegations against the financial secretary were  presentation of incomplete receipts, contrary to what was approved by the legislative house, missing of seven booklets of receipts, and unconstitutional behaviours during the proceedings. SU President Comrade Ayuba Muye confirmed Faruk’s suspension, and directed CAMPUSLIFE to Sadiq for further information. A member of the SU, who pleaded anonymity, said the cat was let out of the bag when four of the five members who comprised SRA’s financial and budget committee discovered the ‘fraud’. The committee, thereafter, announced the suspension, the source added. In his defence however, Faruk described his suspension as ‘unconstitutional’, adding that few members of the union executed the sanction without going through due process. “I am not guilty unless there is factual and concrete evidence against me,” Faruk said. Another source, also a member of the union who is close to both parties bud did not want his name in print, claimed the Faruk was axed owing to personal interest from some members of the union.
