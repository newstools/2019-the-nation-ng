Michael, 43, who lives in Gbagada, Lagos, is facing a one-count charge of deprivation of liberty. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye alleged that the defendant committed the offence on May 16, at 10, Akinola Adeniyi Street, Gbagada. She said the  IE officials, Mrs. Uloma Anudu and Mr. Thompson Joseph, went to the defendant’s house for a random meter inspection. According to her, they found that the defendant had allegedly bypassed his meter to avoid payment. She said when the officials wanted to leave, the engineer asked his guard to lock the gate. He was said to have detained them to avoid being served a notice to appear at IE office. “My lord, the defendant locked the officials inside his compound for over four hours. “He refused to let them go until some other IE officials came to the house with operatives from Ifako Police Station.” Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendant N200, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned till August 7.
