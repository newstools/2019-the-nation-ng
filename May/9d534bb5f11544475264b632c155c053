It was fanfare of some sort yesterday in Kosofe Local Government Area of Lagos, as Hon. Moyosore Ogunlewe aka Moyo, formally of the PDP defected to the APC. The official declaration, which took place at Ogudu Junior Grammar School, Ogudu GRA, Lagos, had thousands of APC party faithful and supporters of Ogunlewe within and outside the Kosofe environs in attendance. Ogunlewe was the PDP Candidate in the Kosofe Constituency 1 in the last House of Assembly elections, which his fiercest rival of the APC, Hon Ganiyu Babatunde Okanlawon, aka Okla, won. He also gave a fierce battle in 2015 elections. Arriving the venue with his horde of supporters, Ogunlewe, sporting a colourful APC Next Level shirt, said he was happy to be joining the winning party. The youthful Moyo thanked the leaders of the party for receiving him with open heart, and asked that they forgive him for whatever he might have done wrong in the past. “The PDP was an opportunity for me to contest, but I’m home now,” he said. “I am defecting today officially with majority of my PDP EXCOs because majority of them were there because of their love for me. The grassroots are with me and that tells you that I’ll be adding value to the fold. A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Kosofe Constituency II, Hon. Tunde Braimoh, said it is a good thing that the party is expanding. “In APC, there is no founder, there is no joiner; it’s a party of mass revolution; a party that is taking Nigeria to the next level. It is a great opportunity to have you join the APC fold,” Braimoh said. Chairman, APC Kosofe, Alhaji Kehinde Bello, said the Kosofe APC family is happy to have Moyo in the party of the progressives. Hon. Moyosore Ogunlewe is a lawyer and son of former PDP chieftain and Minister of Works.
