Pep Guardiola claimed he is disinterested in following Liverpool’s match during what could be a dramatic Premier League finale. Manchester City will retain the title if they beat Brighton but anything less could allow Liverpool lift their first for 29 years. Guardiola, who appeared calm before the team travels to the south coast today, suggested there is no point keeping tabs on the game at Anfield. ”It’s better to focus on what we have to do,’ the City manager said. ‘If we win then you don’t need anything else. It’d be nice to score a quick goal but it’s not going to happen, because we analysed how Brighton defend this week. I knew from the FA Cup and when they were here that it’s difficult. ”We just need to focus on the game we have to play. If they (Liverpool) win we have to win, we don’t have to be distracted. ”We saw that in the Champions League if you go out everybody destroys the managers and the clubs. I know we’ll be judged – you have to win.’ Guardiola revealed Kevin De Bruyne could return from a hamstring injury after taking part in two sessions, although Fernandinho is definitely out again. The Catalan believes Bernardo Silva has been the club’s standout performer this season – and should have won the player of the year gongs. ”He was the best and not just in our team – but I don’t vote. He can play incredibly well everywhere, give me a team and he can play well there. He does everything good. Any team in the world he could play – by far,” Guardiola added.
