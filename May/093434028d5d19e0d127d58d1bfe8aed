A teenager, Tunde Olaiya, who allegedly broke into a woman’s apartment through the ceiling and stole phones and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards, on Friday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The police arraigned Olaiya, 19, along with Waheed Aderayo, 20, on charges of conspiracy, burglary and stealing. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendants burgled the residence of one Mrs Olayinka Adetope and stole her phones and ATM cards on April 24 at Ikosi in Ketu area of Lagos. “They stole her Infinix phone valued at N50, 000, a Tecno phone worth N30, 000 and an internet modem worth N30, 000. “They also stole two ATM cards of GTBank and Standard Chartered Bank,” he submitted. Ihiehie said the defendants were caught by Adetope’s  neighbours. “The stolen items were recovered and handed over to the police,” he said. The alleged offences contravene Sections 287, 307 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 307 prescribes seven years’ jail term for burglary. The Magistrate, Mrs Bukola Mogaji, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N70, 000 each with two sureties in like sum. Mogaji ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until May 13 for mention. NAN
