Sunday Olapade beat other top contenders to be crowned the champion of the 62nd Asantehene Golf Championship in Kumasi, Ghana yesterday. The tournament, which was concluded at the Royal Golf Club in Kumasi, saw Olapade hold onto his lead from the first day to the final day to emerge champion. The competition served as a good warm-up for this week’s African Tour tagged Port Harcourt Classics. Being his first title in 2019, an elated Olapade told NationSport  that he would be inspired to do well in Port Harcourt after the title. “This is a good motivation for me going to Port Harcourt this week. I played against some of the best players in Ghana and I am sure that I am now in the right frame of mind going into any tournament, now having started the year with a drought. And I am so elated winning my first title in 2019 and I look forward to more successes this year, particularly on the African Tour,” Olapade said. The MicCom Golf Club professional star fended off competition from host players including Vince Togar and Amos Koblar. Hundreds of players within and outside Ghana competed in the competition with Olapade carting home the $3,500 prize. The tournament was staged as part of the 20th-anniversary celebration of the coronation of Asantehene, who is the royal father of Asante. It is the 63nd edition of the tournament. Olapade is the first foreigner to win the competition
