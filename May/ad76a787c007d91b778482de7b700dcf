Victor Moses was delighted to help Turkish Super Ligue side Fenerbahce end the season with a 3-1 victory over Antalyaspor on Sunday. Goals from Moses, Miha Zajc and Eljif Elmas rendered Mevlut Erdinc’s effort a mere consolation as the Yellow Canaries ended the season on a high. The victory saw Ersun Yanal’s men finish in the sixth place on the table with 46 points from 34 games, having been in the relegation zone at the start of the season. Following the impressive performances, the on-loan Chelsea winger has taken to the social media to bear his thought. “Fantastic way to end the season yesterday with a win, it was nice to get on the scoresheet again too. Also want to say a massive thank you to all of our fans for the amazing support you’ve shown us this season,” Moses posted on Instagram. Moses scored four goals in 15 appearances across all competitions since joining the Turkish side from Chelsea in January.
