Comedian Akpororo has hit back on OAP personality Daddy freeze for taunting him over the low turnout of people at his Comedy show titled `Akpororo Live on Stage.’ Akpororo held a comedy gig at his neighbourhood in Okokomaiko on May 4, Lagos. A video however surfaced online showing organisers slashing ticket price and at some point making the show ‘free’ due to ‘low turn-out’. Daddy Freeze, who once had a fall-out with Akpororo over paying of ‘tithes’ reacted to the video. “Wasn’t this the same comedian that insulted me and called me a wall gecko at the House of the Rock experience last December? Has his tithe stopped working for him or did he miss paying his tithe for a month?’’, Daddy freeze said. Akpororo, in his response posted a video on Instagram with the caption. #roronation I dey my house jeje ooo now Wall gecko walker enter Abeg wetting una want make I do am
“I still pay my tithe and it is still working for me man! Ehnnn Daddy Freeze look the picture na better show I get yesterday and people full am. Ewo ewooo you be elderly person na, you be elderly person na. Guy get sense, get sense” Akpororo blatantly said in his video. NAN
