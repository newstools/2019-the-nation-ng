Nigerian equities reopened yesterday on a tit-for-tat trading as bargain hunters and profit-takers held the equities market to almost a balance. With an advancer for every decliner, the inclusion of the two leading banks-Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTB) and Zenith Bank International Plc among the decliners tilted the market to a marginal net capital depreciation of N6 billion. The All Share Index (ASI)- the main index that tracks share prices, dropped by 0.05 per cent to close at 29,196.87 points as against its opening index of 29,212.00 points. Aggregate market capitalisation of quoted equities dropped by N6 billion to close at N10.973 trillion as against its opening value of N10.979 trillion. Average year-to-date return inched up to -7.11 per cent. With 14 gainers and losers each, sectoral indices showed mixed performance with selloffs in banking sector counterbalanced by gains in the insurance sector. The NSE Banking Index dropped by 0.68 per cent. The NSE Industrial Goods Index dipped by 0.51 per cent while the NSE Oil & Gas Index declined by 0.15 per cent. On the positive side, the NSE Insurance Index appreciated by 2.35 per cent while the NSE Consumer Goods Index rose by 0.10 per cent.

Total volume traded went down by 23.93 per cent to 271.08 million shares valued at N1.49 billion in 3,814 deals. Japaul Oil & Maritimes Services was the most active stock with 58.61 million shares valued at N23.4 million.  United Bank for Africa (UBA) followed with 36.997 million shares worth N244.78 million while Courteville traded 30.68 million shares valued at N7.36 million. “In our view, the sustained sell-offs in the Nigerian equities market is overdone compared to peer markets. This provides a basis for the ASI to recover in the absence of further downside risks. Beyond the obvious, we believe that the blend of positive macroeconomic fundamentals and compelling valuations supports our view of a near term recovery,” Cordros Capital stated.
