Katsari Local Government Area, one of the eight frontline Local Government Areas of Katsina State, yesterday declared that it no longer has faith in the ability of the police and other security agencies to contain the onslaught by bandits. It has, therefore, announced plans to mobilise its people and other self-help efforts towards ensuring security in the area. The council borders Zamfara State, which is being troubled by kidnapping and banditry, Alhaji Mannir Muazu Rumah, the Council Transition Committee Chairman, who identified the peaceful protest by his people as demonstration of lack of confidence in the police, spoke to reporters while reacting to the worsening security situation in the area He noted that the security situation was beyond the capability of the security agencies, including the police. Rumah  added that the council is planning to mobilise the people to join hands with it to ensure that everyone in the area sleeps with his or her two eyes closed. He said: “The security structures mounted by the various agencies and the police in the area are not working, as attacks have persisted unabated. “You can imagine that the IGP’s Operation Puff Arder is strategically located at this local government headquarters, and yet it does nothing to reduce the crime. The men are neither flexible nor mobile, and hardly arrive promptly to the scene of crime or attend to distress calls. He expressed fear of a looming food scarcity in the state if the situation is left unchecked as farmers refused not cultivate their farmlands over growing insecurity The council boss also called on the people of the area to intensify prayers for God to intervene in addressing the menace.
