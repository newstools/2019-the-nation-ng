A Magistrate Court in Mpape, Abuja will in in few minutes decide whether or not the police should allow Senator Ademola Adeleke travel abroad on medical grounds. Magistrate Muhammed Shehu announced after taking arguments from lawyers to the police and Adeleke, that he will  give ruling in the next 30 minutes. Adeleke,dressed in blue native attire, was brought before the court by the police, in a white bus,around 9.30am. When the case was called, Simon Lough (prosecution) applied that the charge filed against Adeleke be read, a request Adetosoye Adebiyi (for Adeleke) objected to on the grounds that there were two pending High Court’s orders, allowing the Senator to travel for medical attention and restraining the police from detaining the defendant for any reasons. Everyone is waiting for the court to resume and deliver its ruling.
