The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. William Alo, has called on the newly recruited labour officers to be good ambassadors where ever they are called to represent the ministry. The Permanent Secretary made this call yesterday in Abuja, as he flagged off a two-day induction programme for the newly recruited labour officers in the ministry. Represented by the Director Human Resources Management, Alhaji Ibrahim Ajibola, Alo said the essence of the workshop is to educate the officers in the discharge of their duties and equip them to be at their best in the pursuit of their chosen career in the federal civil service. He urged them to be knowledge driven, dedicated, diligent, honest in the discharge of their duties and aspire to promote the image of the ministry.
