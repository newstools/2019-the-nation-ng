The situation according to the eyewitness caused serious tension throughout Tuesday night to Wednesday morning and all efforts by the traditional ruler, the Odion Nyankpa, Dr Joel Aninge, to douse the tension proved abortive, as angry youths of both the locals and Hausa community exchanged fierce battle that took the lives of three persons.

The situation is under control” Akala said. The commissioner of police in Nasarawa State, CP Bola Longe, also confirmed the crisis to our correspondent in a telephone interview.
