According to local reports, current and former players, as well as club officials, from Spain’s top two divisions have been detained. Press Association Sport understands the match in question was a La Liga 2 game. A La Liga spokesman said in a statement: “Today’s police action follows a complaint filed by La Liga with the Spanish authorities about possible match-fixing in a May 2018 match. “We want to thank the national police for the extraordinary work done to dismantle what appears to be an organised criminal group dedicated to obtaining economic benefits through the predetermination of football matches.” La Liga said it had tipped off the police after its “integrity protection systems”, which involve detailed analysis of betting patterns, detected possible match-fixing. The league said that during the most recent season it had filed eight complaints with the general commissioner of the judicial police “for alleged acts related to match-fixing” below La Liga 2 and in international friendlies played in Spain. It had also flagged up 18 suspicious matches with the General Directorate of Gaming for the possible identification and sanction of players.
