I don’t think that glory should be shared with him by my presence,” Ambode said. Ambode said he has had a quality private moment with him ( Sanwo-Olu) and he is confident that with the prayers, cooperation and collective support of all Lagosians, the new government will succeed in the excellent tradition of progressive governance which Lagos State is known for.
