Imo Government has announced a postponement of the planned working visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to the state. The postponement was contained in a statement issued in Owerri on Tuesday by Mr Sam Onwuemeodo, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Rochas Okorocha. Onwuemeodo said that the visit earlier slated for Tuesday was postponed because of the president’s holy pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the president was scheduled to visit Imo to commission some key projects executed by Okorocha’s administration. Onwuemeodo, who pleaded for people’s understanding over the postponement, said, “we regret the inconvenience that this development might have caused.” He said that a new date would be announced upon the president’s return to Nigeria.
