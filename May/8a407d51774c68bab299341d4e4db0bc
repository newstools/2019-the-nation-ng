A student, Muhammad Lawal, on Tuesday prayed a  Sharia Court I, Magajin Gari, Kaduna to order his estranged wife, to look for a”good woman” for him to marry, if she wants him to divorce her. Maryam Muhammad of Kabba road, Kaduna, had dragged Lawal, seeking divorce because she was no longer interested in the marriage. Lawal told the court that he was still in love with his wife. “Since she left my house, I have made efforts to see that she comes back to my house so that we  can live together peacefully. “I love my wife. Marriage is very difficult now. I can’t afford to marry another woman now. ”If she can’t stay with me any longer,  she should search for another good wife for me’, Lawal said. Earlier,  Muhammad told the court that she no longer wants to live with her husband because of some unsettled differences. “He paid N30,000 as my bride price. I am ready to return the money. ”I want to court to note that my father gave him N17,000 so that he can meet the N30,000, bride price”Muhammad stressed. After listening to both parties, the Judge, Dahiru Lawal, ordered them to go back and explore all avenues for a eaceful resolution and report back to court on May 28.
