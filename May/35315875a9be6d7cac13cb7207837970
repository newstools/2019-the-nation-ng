HarvestPlus Country Manager, Dr Paul Ilona said the organisation  will  partner  with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural  Development to  release  the new  variety to farmers  which  internationally have yielded averagely  5 .7 tons per hectare. With proper care, experts say the yield can go up to 7.5 tons. It is a farmer-friendly variety and  takes only 125 days to harvest.
