The sit -at -home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (Thursday) in the Southeast worked perfectly in Nnewi, Onitsha and Ekwulobia cities in Anambra State, except in the capital city of Awka. All the markets in the commercial cities, banks and schools were closed as directed by the proscribed Biafran group. But the joint security operatives including the police, Army, Navy and other para Military outfits were all out in their patrols, making sure there was no breach of the law. The outlawed Igbo group mobilised people in the zone to sit- at- home in honour of those who died during the war and others killed across the nation recently. Its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, called the order evangelism as against protest as described by some. Before the 30th May date, the group and security agencies engaged in war of words, which heightened tension in all the states in the Southeast especially, Anambra and Abia the two strongholds of IPOB. However, skeletal services were going on in the state capital of Awka as people were equally going on with their activities without any problems including the markets. But the banks did not open for businesses although their staff were inside chatting and celebrating a form of work- free day for them. Private and public schools in Nnewi, Ekwulobia, Ihiala, Onitsha and their environs were all closed for fear of any possible attack from IPOB members.
