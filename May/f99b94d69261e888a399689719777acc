The Kuwait Embassy in Nigeria has distributed foodstuff to orphans and widows in Dutse, the Jigawa state capital. The items were distributed under Project of Ramadan Iftar (breaking of fast) by Kuwait Awqaf Public Foundation and Kuwait Embassy in Nigeria. The assistance was channelled through the state chapter of the Union of African Muslim Scholars, Jigawa state chapter. Among the food items donated were rice, semovita, macaroni, sugar, vegetable oil and seasoning cubes. The Secretary of the Union, Malam Salisu Gumel, said the gesture was to assist the widows, orphans and the less privilege to alleviate their hardship during Ramadan period. According to him, the embassy had been assisting the needy and vulnerable not only during Ramadan, but in the areas of education and health. The District Head of Dutse, Alhaji Jamilu Basiru, warned the beneficiaries against selling the items. “I urged you to take these items to your respective house in order to share with your family members.  If you are a male beneficiary, ensure you take the items to your wife to cook for all the family members to eat.  Also, if you are female beneficiary make sure you assist your husband by cooking the items for all to eat,” Alhaji Basiru said. The traditional ruler, who commended the embassy and the Union for the gesture, urged other wealthy individuals in the area to emulate.
