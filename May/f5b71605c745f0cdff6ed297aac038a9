One year after Nollywood actress Aishat Abimbola died from breast cancer, her colleagues in the industry have taken to social media to remember her. Actress Wunmi Toriola wrote: “Aunty Aishat, I join the world to celebrate you. Yes, celebration of life because your legacy lives on, may your soul rest in peace…and your children are doing fine, you have a sister in Lola Alao.” Actor Kunle Afod posted a picture of the late Aishat who was also known as a Omoge campus as a sign of remembrance on Instagram. “365 days gone,” he wrote. “We miss you so much… Amb Aishat Abimbola…Rest on”. Another actress, Funke Etti, also took to Instagram and wrote: ‘Just like yesterday, rest in peace sis Aisha Abimbola, God loves you most” while Bisola Badmus simply wrote, “rest on.” Aishat died of breast cancer last year in Canada at the age of 46 and she was survived with two children
