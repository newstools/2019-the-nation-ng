The company changed its name from Equity Assurance Plc to SUNU Assurances Nigeria Plc with due approval from the shareholders and its regulator, NAICOM.  The approval was dated  March 29, 2018 and a new licence as issued by NAICOM. “The name change was necessitated as a result of SUNU Group’s recent acquisition of majority stake in Equity Assurance Plc. With operations in 14 African countries and 23 office locations spanning West and Central Africa, SUNU Assurances Nigeria Plc. is positioned to leverage SUNU Group’s vast network of knowledge capital, financial strength and technical resources in our quest to differentiate our offerings and service standards in the Nigerian marketplace. ‘’In addition to strengthening the company’s balance sheet, this strategic investment and name change also provides SUNU Assurances Nigeria Plc. with critical organisational capabilities & competencies which will be harnessed to create and deliver value to our esteemed brokers and clients.
