The right age for children to have their cell phones is up to their parents. No parent has an answer to this question but some parents would like their child to have one only when they are of the appropriate age. However, it is important to understand that times have changed, and the world is not as safe for children as it used to be. Most parents feel that a child should get a phone between the age 10-12. Kids’ access to phones allows them to have total control over this powerful communication tool, which helps them in sending messages, images and videos to their friends as well as accessing websites on the internet. Recently, children in primary schools were seen using phones but research from 2016 shows that the average age for a child to have their first phone is 10, although many parents wait for their children to start school at the age of 11 or 12 or rather as a gift. If a parent is going to allow smartphones at this age, there should be cautions against letting young kids watch harmless videos on YouTube without monitoring them because children can end up being redirected to inappropriate content without parents’ knowledge. There are some things to put in mind before handing a phone to your child. A parent should consider safety reasons, the purpose of the child using the phone, responsibility and internet safety.
