A businessman, Jide Filani, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly slapping a man. He pleaded not guilty to the one-count charge of assault. Prosecuting Sergeant Ishola Samuel alleged that Filani committed the offence last December 10 at his home. “Filani assaulted the complainant, Mr. Damilare Lawal, by slapping him in public several times. He pushed him till he fell down and injured his head and hand during a disagreement,” Samuel told the court.
