Yobe State Deputy Gov. Hon. Idi Barde Gubana on Thursday marked his first official day in office as the new deputy governor of Yobe State. On the other hand, his boss, Gov. Mai Mala Buni did not come to the office but instead has jetted out to Abuja to continue to lobby for Sen. Ahmed Lawan to become the next Senate president of the 9th Assembly which will be constituted next month. Gov. Buni’s visit to Abuja today was earlier announced on Wednesday by his spokesman Abdullahi Bego at the swearing-in ceremony. According to Bego, the Governor was billed to travelling to Abuja on Thursday to continue with the consultation for the actualization of Sen. Ahmed Lawan’s presidency of the 9th Senate. Our correspondent who visited the government House Damaturu this morning saw the Deputy Governor on seat in his office receiving felicitations and prayers from people in his office. In a brief exclusive chat with our correspondent, Hon. Idi Barde Gubana while expressing gratitude to the Almighty God for seeing the day, thanked Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam for nurturing and passing on a great Yobe to them (him and his boss) to continue with. He also thanked Hon. Mai Mala for finding him as a worthy ally to move Yobe to the next level. Hon. Gubana also promised to give his boss “all the necessary support to make sure that he succeeds as our mentor, Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam did”.
