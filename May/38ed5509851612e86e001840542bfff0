Super Eagles’ new sensation, Samuel Chukwueze has vowed to continue to work hard on his game despite being named the Most Valuable African Player U-20, AOIFootball.com reports. The 19-old, who was named the 12th Most Valuable Teenager, is valued at €35 million, told AOIFootball.com that he remains humble with the latest achievement. “It’s always a pleasure for me to see my name being mentioned among the best at what I do. For me, it’s a privilege and I want to continue doing my best to ensure I even keep getting better. “It’s been a good first season for me as a professional and I want to ensure I keep giving my best on the pitch to ensure I finish the season on a good note,” Chukwueze said. The Villarreal star remains a target of top European clubs this summer with the Yellow Submarines, stating that only a club record transfer fee will tempt them into parting ways with the young Nigerian.
