Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, has emerged the chairman of PDP Governors Forum. 

His emergence was announced Wednesday night by Governor Ibrahim Dankwambo of Gombe State who relinquished the position yesterday. The announcement was made shortly after a meeting of the governors in Abuja. Speaking with journalists after the meeting, Dankwabo said the governors expressed concerns over the state of insecurity in the country and how it affects food security. The governors lamented a situation where farmers in many parts of the country can no longer go to farms for fear of being killed or kidnapped by armed bandits.  They urged President Buhari to declare a state of emergency on security in the country.
