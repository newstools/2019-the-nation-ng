Unified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua says he will only feel he has “made it” in boxing if he captures Deontay Wilder’s World Boxing Council (WBC) title. Joshua, the World Boxing Association (WBA), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organisation (WBC) champion, faces Andy Ruiz Jr on Saturday at Madison Square Garden. Joshua said: “Yeah, it looks like I have made it but it’s only when I put my hand on the last title – and win on Saturday – then I can say I have made it. “It’s been down to calculated steps. It’s been a good journey, a tough journey. On the sides of the journey there are billboards, then with time, two billboards but it’s all about winning in this sport. “I haven’t put a foot wrong yet and I am not looking to put a foot wrong on Saturday either.” Saturday’s fight at Madison Square Garden will see AJ end nine months of inactivity, during which talks with Deontay Wilder have yielded nothing in the shape of a historic contest where one man could win all four heavyweight world titles for the first time.
