An unidentified man was on Thursday morning killed in an accident involving a trailer carrying a container. The accident occurred on Ilasamaja Road, Ilasamaja, Lagos. The deceased, The Nation learnt, was one of the ‘motor boys’ attached to the trailer’s driver. The driver was reportedly injured. An eyewitness said the trailer, which carried a 20-feet container laden with plywood, entered a pothole and the container fell and crushed the ‘motor boy’. It was gathered that the driver and one other person in the vehicle narrowly escaped death, but they were injured. Our reporter, who visited the accident scene, saw officials of the Response Unit of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) and the Police State Traffic “B” OPS Department, Ikeja. The body, which was put in a bag, was on the floor. The rescue team removed the container. A rescue official, who preferred anonymity, said the container fell as a result of a pothole on the road, which was covered by water due to the rain that fell earlier. He said: “This road is bad. The driver entered the pothole unknowingly. The ‘motor boy’ died instantly while trying to run for his life.” An ambulance of the Ministry of Health, Directorate of Environmental Health Services (DEHSU), arrived the scene at about 12:30 pm to carry the body to the mortuary.
