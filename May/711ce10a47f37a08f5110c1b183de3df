The  Rivers Police Command yesterday  killed six alleged kidnap suspects in shootouts with the police. Police Commissioner Usman Belele told reporters in Port Harcourt that  his men had stormed the suspects’  hideout at Eneka in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers. On sighting the police,  the suspects allegedly opened fire ,wounding  two police officers. Belel said when his officers returned fire, five gang members were “fatally wounded.” They were taken to University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UTPH) but were confirmed dead by a medical doctor. The CP also said  that one Ntuariuwa a.k.a “change the world”, described as a notorious kidnapper on police wanted list, was also “fatally” wounded and killed in a separate shootout with the police, bringing the number of killed alleged kidnappers to six. In another development, the command also arrested 20 suspected criminals in connection with various offences. According the commissioner, 12 of the suspects were arrested in connection with alleged cult activities, four for alleged kidnapping and another four for alleged robbery. He said the command foiled two robbery attempts, recovered three AK47 assault rifles and five locally made pistols. Others included three pump action guns, eight machetes, five magazines, 60 ammunition and 40 cartridges.
