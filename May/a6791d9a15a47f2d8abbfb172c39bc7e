Gov. Emeka Ihedioha of Imo has directed all financial institutions having relationship with the state government not to honour any withdrawal instruction by cheques, transfers or in any other form. The directive was announced in a statement by the governorâ€™s Special Adviser on Media Affairs, Mr Steve Osuji in Owerri on Thursday. According to him, no financial mandates or any form of financial instruction should be treated and all outstanding financial instructions already with banks and financial institutions should be put on hold. Ihedioha directed that the directive, which would take immediate effect, would cover, all the accounts of Ministries, Departments, Parastatals, Local Government Councils, Quasi-government Agencies, and all revenue generating organs of government. He directed banks and other financial institutions to ensure compliance, as the state government would not be responsible for any disbursement, effected contrary to the directive, adding that the directive would remain in force until otherwise communicated. The Imo helmsman cautioned that Heads of government departments, parastatal agencies, permanent secretaries and relevant officers would be held responsible for any breach. (NAN)
