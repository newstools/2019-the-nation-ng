A security guard, Godwin Edika, was yesterday at an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court sentenced to 22 months imprisonment for stealing goods worth N15 million. Magistrate K. S. Abdulsalam convicted Edika, 27, after he changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. Edika got one year  on count one (conspiracy) and 22 months on count two (stealing). “Both sentences will run concurrently. They will take effect from the date of the defendant’s arraignment, October 10, 2018,” the magistrate added. The case was adjourned till May 16, for continuation of trial of Edika’s co-defendant, Clement Lawson. Reviewing the facts of the case before the sentence, prosecuting Inspector Philips Osijale said Edika and his co-guard, Lawson, 28, were arraigned last October 10, on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Edika stole a generator worth N250,000, four inverter batteries with a charger worth N3.5 million, four Panasonic split unit air-conditioners worth N800, 000; four HP laptops worth N1 million and 20, 000 US dollars. Other stolen items included a 42-inch Panasonic television worth N200, 000, Panasonic camera worth N250,000, two Apple IPads worth N400, 000 and four imported towels worth N20, 000. Osijale gave the  value of all the items, which belonged to Builders Home Stores Ltd, as N15 million. He said instead of doing their job as gurads, they stole their employers’ goods, which were in their care. “Some of the items were recovered from the defendant,” Osijale said.
