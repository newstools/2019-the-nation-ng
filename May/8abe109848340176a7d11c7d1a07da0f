Borno State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum is angry over lateness of workers in the state. He discovered this during an unscheduled visit to the state secretariat on Friday. The Governor, who was at the Musa Usman state Secretariat, Maiduguri as early as 8:30 am expressed disappointment with the number of civil servants that came to work as at 9.30am. After spending an hour at the secretariat, Zulum counted only 135 out of about 12,000 workers at the secretariat. “We are not going to tolerate late coming and absenteeism though it is a Ramadan, we at least expect them to be at the place of work at least by 9:00am more especially the Christian ones. “Government will live up to its expectations but the workers too must do their own part,” the governor cautioned. in a dramatic twist of luck, Gov. Zulum has directed the State Head of Service to immediately pay the leave grants and other bonuses to the 135 workers he met on their duties during his visit. He warned his administration will not tolerate indiscipline and absenteeism, adding that hardworking and dedicated workers will be rewarded just as unserious one will be punished. The governor ordered the payment of all outstanding salaries, pensions and granites in the state amounting to over N20 billion. Workers in Borno state have been subjected to untold hardship due to a biometric exercise embarked upon by immediate past Governor Kasim Shettima for more than three years
