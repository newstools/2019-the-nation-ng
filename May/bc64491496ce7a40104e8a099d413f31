The Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria has called on the Federal Government to stop the planned increment in the price of flour. A statement by its National Secretary, Jude Okafor, noted that the price of a 50kg bag of flour should not cost more than N8,500 as against the current price of N10,500. The statement reads: “As partners in business, 90 per cent of our members are heavily indebted and produce at a loss because they are not allowed to cut standards to break through.” The association noted that the latest increase will lead to closure of many bakeries which will lead to unemployment. It, therefore, called on the Federal Government to address the 10 per cent increase and stop the deduction of 15 per cent wheat duty originally established to fund the cassava bread development fund. The stoppage, the association said, will reduce the price by N1,000.
