Supporting small farmers  will boost the nation’s exports, the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI) Executive Director, Dr Olufemi Oladunni, has said. Speaking at the Agri-Produce Exportation Summit organised by ARMTI in Abuja, Oladunni said there was the need to empower farmers to increase their harvests and provide support for them in drawing up contracts with the various actors along the value chain, adding that this would boost their earnings and create more job opportunities. Oladunni declared that small holder farmers form the bulk of agro producers and having them operate below optimum capacity, would limit their potential. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Permanent Secretary, Dr Mohammed Umar, commended ARMTI for being a key player in the sector. He challenged the participants to  collaborate in tackling the challenges facing the sector so that Nigeria could take its rightful place in the global scheme of things and farmers can begin to take advantage of the international market for their produce and for wealth creation. Umar pledged that the ministry would implement the communique that would be issued at the end of the event.
