The Onwueweko of Okpekpe, His Royal Highness, Apa, Peter Abalumhe Osigbemeh, yesterday called on the Edo State Government and organisers of the 7th Okpekpe International 10 Kilometer Road Race, to put in place permanent features of the tournament that tourists would see even after the end of every edition. According to him, tourists and holiday seekers who visit the kingdom with the high hope of eye-catching features of the road race, are always surprised that there is no relic of the event after it has been held for several times. Speaking with The Nation during the tournament in Okpekpe, Etsako East Local Government Area, Edo State, the monarch said: “We expect that there should be featured at any given time to show that this is the venue, where this event is always taking place. What I am saying is that not everything should be removed from the venue. This is because people have been coming they want to know where this event is taking place but there is nothing to show them in the arena.” He recalled that he has been calling for the building of a mini-sport facility in the venue, stressing that building a permanent structure would be of great benefit to the tournament. On her part, the Ogieavhianwu, HRH, Etokhana Jackson, commended the organisers of the race, whom he said have always improved on their yearly outing. The former Vice Chairman, Etsako East Local Government Area, Hon. Edward Imhanobe, noted that besides the popularity that the community has garnered from the road race, it does not bring any direct benefit to the people. He urged indigenes of Okpekpe and investors from other places to take advantage of the road race to build hotel accommodation in the community. He also called on the state government to site campus of one of their universities in Okpekpe in order to optimize the benefits from the road race.
