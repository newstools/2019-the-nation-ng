The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims, to use the Ramadan period to pray for peace and love to continue to reign in Nigeria. “The Ramadan period calls for sober reflection for all of us. It is a period that calls for us to move closer to God and we should not relent in our prayers for peace and love to reign in Nigeria,” the Lagos Assembly Speaker, who is also Chairman of Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, said. Obasa said: “It is a period for us to be tolerant of each other. Ramadan goes beyond abstinence from food, drinks and sexual intercourse alone.  It is also the period for us to be reinvigorated and reinvest ourselves spiritually. We should continue to pray continued peace and love in the country.” Obasa urged Nigerians to remain security conscious by being vigilant at all time. “We have to assist security agencies in combating crimes by being vigilant at all time. We should refrain from utterances and actions that can cause breach of peace in the society. We should also endeavour to be watchful of our environment by promptly any suspicious action, person or group of people,” he said.
