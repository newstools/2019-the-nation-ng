A group, G20 Club Abuja, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more troops to Taraba and Benue borders. The group said the call followed the outcry by the two state governors over their inability to contain the wanton killings and destructions of lives and properties their borders. The group, in a statement signed by its interim spokesman, Mr. Osborne Adi Jnr, said: “President Muhammadu Buhari has been enjoined to deploy more troops to Taraba and Benue states border to stop the carnage that has claimed more than 100 lives in the area in recent weeks. “The call is coming on the heels of outcry by the two states’ chief executives – Darius Ishaku and Samuel Ortom – over their inability to contain the wanton killings and destructions of lives and properties currently ongoing in their states. “Ishaku had last week lamented that there was nothing his government could do about the crises since the security architecture was outside his control and has, therefore, resorted to only prayers. “Ortom on the other hand, had a forth night ago, told President Buhari at the State House Villa, Abuja that three local governments of Katisna-Ala, Logo and Ukum – all in his state – were now under the control of the most wanted gangster Terwase Akwazah, alias Gana.” The G-20 Club said the immediate intervention of the President has become imperative, in view of the failure of the two states to curb the carnage that has also resulted in thousands of internally displaced persons, besides loss of lives. Adi Jnr said the crises continued unabated because there were no enough troops on ground to match the number of youths engaging in the unwarranted criminal activities through kidnappings and attack on important and unsuspected villagers.
