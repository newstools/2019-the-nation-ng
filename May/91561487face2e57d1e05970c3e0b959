About 12 persons have been killed in parts of Benin City, the Edo State capital, in a renewed cult war. Some were killed at the Agbor park axis, while others were murdered around Murtala Muhammed Way and Third Junction area. Three persons were hacked to death at Isibor junction, adjacent to St Saviour Road. On Monday and Sunday night, traders around the Third junction hurriedly closed shops, following sporadic shootings between rival cultists and policemen. It was learnt that the renewed killings started on Sunday night when a victim was killed at Iyobosa Street, opposite Edo College, at a place popularly called Aso Rock. Another victim was killed by 2nd East Circular, near Ekiosa, by Lucky junction. A 22-year-old boy identified as Ogbe was shot dead on Monday night. The Legend Foundation has, however, urged the government and security agencies to step up their fight against crimes, especially cultism. The Director-General of the group, Kadiri Christopher, said parents should guide their children against cultism and others. Police Commissioner Danmallam Abubakar said one person was injured during the Monday incident, but was in a stable condition. He said the police repelled the cultists, adding that nobody was killed. “There was shooting. The cultists came out and we repelled them. We need the cooperation of the people to curb the activities of cultists. We made some arrests at Ekpoma and two in Benin. “Nobody has been killed to my knowledge, but somebody was wounded. He is in a stable condition.”
