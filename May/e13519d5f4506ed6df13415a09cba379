The newly sworn in governor of Bauchi state, Bala Mohammed has declared all last minute appointments carried out by his predecessor, Mohammed Abubakar null and void. Bala Mohammed who was sworn in on Wednesday by the acting Chief Judge of the state, Hajiya Rabi Umar, gave the directive while delivering his inaugural speech. The governor, while citing reasons for the reverse, said due processes were not followed in the appointments Bala Mohammed had earlier before his inauguration vowed to sue his predecessor for last minute recruitment of civil servants, reinstatement of district heads and awards of contracts. The governor said: “It is said that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Nothing defines this as the various actions of policy somersault, reversals and impulse capitalisation of government. “Some of the issues are too sordid to enumerate. I want to state categorically that all appointments, promotions, transfers and secondments, including those that are meant to create friction and division along traditional institutions, from the day I was declared by INEC as the winner of the gubernatorial elections to my swearing- in today, are hereby declared null and void” Bala also directed all allegedly dubious approvals given on land allocations, sale of government vehicles and houses as well as alleged spurious contracts awarded in the dying minutes of the last administration to be cancelled. “In cases where the instrumentality of Kangaroo legislation was used as a mask , we shall use the instrumentality of credible legislations to consign the absurdity to the scrap heaps of history,” he stressed. In compliance with his directive, he ordered most senior officials of departments and agencies (MDA) to ensure strict compliance. He also said his  administration will establish a high powered  committee  to recover all assets and properties of government that were illegally disposed by the past administration.
