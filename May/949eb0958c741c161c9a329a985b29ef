Four aviation unions- National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) and the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE)- have begun a nationwide indefinite strike today. This action is over failure of Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to resolve concerns raised over the faulty organogram in the authority. The unions said they had to embark on the industrial action following collapsed efforts by the Ministry of Transport, Aviation Unit, to handle their complaints about organogram in NCAA and sundry issues. The nationwide action begins by 5am. The circular directing NCAA workers to proceed on the industrial action was  signed by Comrades Ocheme Aba, Frances Akinjole, Abdul Rasaq Saidu and Umoh Ofonime,  for NUATE, ATSSSAN, ANAP and NAAPE, respectively. According to the unions, at the expiration of the ultimatum on Monday, the ministry and the management of NCAA had failed to address any of the demands raised, threatening that the agency would remain grounded until the issues were addressed.
