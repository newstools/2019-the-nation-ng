THE Oluwo of Iwoland, Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, Telu I, has advised foremost royal fathers in Yorubaland to initiate action that will save the sanctity of the traditional institutions. Oluwo’s admonition is coming as the Yoruba traditional institution is enmeshed in controversies over the crowning of some monarchs in diaspora by the Olugbo of Ugboland, Oba Obateru Akinruntan, Oba Akanbi particularly called on paramount rulers in Yoruba land, including the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, the Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Oyedotun, the Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran, the Alake of Egba, Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, among others to ensure the traditional institution is not dragged in the mud. He also urged the Yoruba Obas Central Committee to halt the regular washing of  traditional linens in public, advising that a template for conflict resolutions among the people of the Yoruba race must be established. In a statement by his media aide, Ibrahim Alli, the Oluwo cautioned that disagreement among the traditional rulers should be managed in-house, especially those related to core tradition, culture and value system. Oba Akanbi described as uncultured some statements credited to many people debating the issue, saying some paramount traditional rulers in Yoruba land have done what the Olugbo did in the past.
