Paris Saint-Germain’s Dani Alves has urged teammate Neymar to display more self-control after his altercation with a fan following last weekend’s Coupe de France final penalty loss to Rennes. Alves and Neymar featured as PSG lost again on Tuesday, this time 3-2 away to Montpellier in Ligue 1 with the former admitted that he was unable to defend Neymar’s recent behaviour. “It was a delicate moment,” he said. “We had just lost a title and he was hot-headed. “It was a reaction and one that I think was not right in that moment. You cannot get involved in this sort of thing. You have to show more control. “I believe that you have to make mistakes to improve. Not necessarily like this, but this mistake will cause him to reflect a bit. Neymar is an exceptional guy, but he can be a bit rash at times. “This sort of reaction, no matter how friendly we are, I cannot be in favour of it. I believe that he has learned, and I hope that it will not happen again.” PSG led twice in Montpellier but were pegged back and ultimately lost to a late Souleymane Camara goal. Neymar played the full 90 minutes but was unable to prevent his team from going down to their third Ligue 1 defeat in their last four matches. Marquinhos, who captained the side in Thiago Silva’s absence, believes that Neymar knows he made a mistake at Stade de France last Saturday. “I think that Neymar knows that he made a mistake,” he said. “When you attack somebody, it is a mistake. He is not a boy anymore — he knows when he is in the wrong. “It will serve as a lesson for him. We already know that things with Neymar are amplified — he is used to that. Mistakes happen and are there to be learned from.” PSG have four Ligue 1 matches left before the end of what will be their least successful season since the 2011-12 campaign — the maiden term under Qatari ownership.
