Sen. Walid Jibrin, the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed regrets over the heinous activities of herdsmen in the country. Jibrin expressed his displeasure over the development on Thursday, when he led members of the board on a courtesy visit to Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia at Government House, Umuahia. He said that every Nigerian had a role to play in promoting and supporting national peace, unity and any cause that would encourage peaceful coexistence in the country. He said: “We are working together to contribute to efforts targeted at addressing herdsmen activities. We are coming to bring an end to it. “We are making arrangements for Fulani leaders to come together to address the issue so that the nation’s unity will be preserved. “It is very sad to see people in this kind of activities. It is not in the nature of many of us and we are not in support of it.” Responding, Ikpeazu thanked the board for its support to his administration. He also hailed the board for its resolve and resilience in handling the affairs of the party to enable it to wax stronger. He promised to promote causes that would bring respect to PDP, adding that he would not disappoint the party or people of Abia in his second tenure. (NAN)
