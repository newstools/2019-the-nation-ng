It’s the beginning of the weekend and you are wondering how to unwind. Your boss has probably been mean to you or your employees have been unproductive. The traffic jam could have left you wishing you could just abandon your car to fly away or the bus conductor sped away with your change. Whatever the case maybe, do not let it get at you. They are just experiences that might make you laugh a year from now. Get into the #FeelGoodFriday mood and let it all off your chest with these tips. Karaoke: The beautiful thing about karaoke is that you do not have to have a beautiful voice. In fact, the more horrible your voice, the more fun and laughter there is. If you can’t make it to a karaoke bar, gather a few friends and do the karaoke in the living room. Download song tunes and lyrics and get singing! Talk to your crush: You may not even share your feelings with your crush. However, having a lovely conversation with your crush can lighten up your weekend. Apologise: Guilt and a heavy conscience are negative feelings that will only weigh you down. If you have wronged somebody, apologise and free yourself of every burden  Dance:  If you think dancing in a party is the only way to have fun, you just might be wrong. Ever tried dancing in front of the mirror? Well go ahead and try it. Let’s see if you wouldn’t laugh at yourself. Read a new book: Read books to that will lift up your spirit. They will help divert your attention from negative feelings. Surprise someone: Do something fun and unexpected for someone. Bringing smiles to that person’s face will lift up your spirits. Spoil yourself: No matter how little it is, do something nice for yourself. Go to the restaurant, get a massage, have a new hair cut or hair-do etc. Whatever it is, make sure you spoil yourself. You deserve it. You deserve to feel good on #feelgoodfriday
