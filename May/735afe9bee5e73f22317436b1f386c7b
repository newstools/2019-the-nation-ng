Mrs Bisi Badmus was disappointed when she went to the market to buy some food stuff in preparation for her daughter’s traditional marriage last Saturday. She budgeted less than the amount she actually needed for her shopping, as prices of items in the market suddenly went up because of the Ramadan. Though last week Thursday, she had gone to the market to inquire the cost of some food items, she would need for the ceremony.  That enabled her to make necessary estimations for the items she would need. But on getting to Daleko Rice Market in Lagos,  she was shocked that a bag of Mama Gold brand, which was originally sold for between N13,200 and N14,000 cost N15,500. Her frustration was heightened when she was asked to pay N16, 000 for a basket of tomato,  which, two weeks ago, sold for N4, 000 at  Mile 12 Market. The plight of Mrs Badmus was not different from other shoppers who were faced with the hike in prices of some food items a week to the Ramadan. It has been sour experiences for them in view of the current cash crunch in the country. For instance, Tope Akinlade who runs a canteen, said the increase has affected her profit margin. “My daily budget for tomatoes, pepper and tatashe is N2, 000, but now I buy close to N4, 000. Prices of virtually all the food items in the market have increased and this has reduced my profit” she lamented. At Daleko Rice Market, rice increased from N14, 500 to N15, 000- 15,700. However,  10kg of Semovita (both Mama Gold and Golden Penny) and five-litre of Kings Oil maintained their initial prices at N3,000. A basket of tomatoes at Mile 12   Market ranges from N8, 000 to N14, 000, depending on the freshness. This was against the N4, 000 it sold a month ago. “The price is even fair since this week.  Last week, it (tomato) was sold for about N20, 000,” a tomatoes seller at the market said. Likewise, a bag of pepper ranges from N10,000 to N16, 000, depending on the freshness, while half bag of tartashe is sold for N10, 000; full bag. N20, 000. A sizable yam is sold for N700 and a bag of yams now sells for N62, 000 as against N60, 000. The increase also affected fruits, which the Muslim faithful use to break their fast. For instance, at Ketu fruit market, a dozen of watermelon is sold for between N7, 000 and N8, 000, depending on the size, as against the initial N4,500 price tag. Lamenting the price increase, a fruit and vegetables seller in Agboju Market in Amuwo Odofin area of Lagos, Alhaji sanni, said though the Ramadan season contributed to the hike in price, most fruits are seasonal crops and are gradually going out of season. Another fruit seller at Balogun market, Mohammed, said he makes a meagre profit of N1, 500 after sales of a cartoon of apple. He, however, said with the increase in the price of apple, which is now N13, 000 (Red apple), N11,000 for the small size of the green apple, he was forced to sell at the rate of  N70 and N150, for an apple. For Mrs Balikis Bakare, who stocked her home in preparation for Ramadan, she was left with no alternative than to give in to sellers’ arbitrary prices. The rush for staple food items for the Ramadan season was an opportunity for sellers to cash-in on shoppers.  At various retail markets, shop owners told The Nation that they recorded huge sales; that they also hope to make much sales all through the Ramadan period. While shoppers’ hinged  the hike in price to the Ramadan season, Mile 12 market spokesman, Mr Femi Odunsanya, explained that the increase was as a result of poor harvest. He said the rainy season, which is fast approaching, was unfavorable to some food crops. He noted that government can assist farmers to mitigate poor harvest by providing a preservation plant will preserve much of the harvested crops got from bountiful harvest seasons for about 60 days.  This, he said, would also help to prevent post harvest wastages. “Last month, the price of tomatoes was N4, 000, now it is sold for between N13, 000 and N14, 000. How can you rationalise between N4,000 and N14,000 within a space of one month? The government can really help out here.  During those periods that there is more than enough, the government is supposed to buy back from the farmers and preserve them and make them available in the market when harvest is declining. “ If Lagos state could invest in preservation plant that can preserve perishable items like tomatoes for 60 days, it will help savage post harvest loses, make it readily available and affordable by all” he noted.
