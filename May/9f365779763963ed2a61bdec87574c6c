A son of a popular Ede-based Islamic cleric, Ibraheem Olaiya, has been killed by hoodlums for allegedly stealing iron rods belonging to the Redeemer’s University, Ede. Ibraheem, a welder and son of the Amir of Zumuratu Mumini in Ede, was said to have been lynched by men suspected to be members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), after he was accused of stealing the rods and his accomplice, an unidentified driver of a commercial bus, who conveyed him to cart away the products, severely beaten. Ibraheem, who reportedly had been put under surveillance, was allegedly caught in the act on Sunday morning. He was said to have been rushed to Oke-Iresi Police Division before the policemen asked that he be taken to hospital. But before Ibraheem could get to the State Hospital in Ede, he had allegedly given up the ghost. The Head, Directorate of Public Affairs, Redeemer’s University, Ede, Mr. Adetunji Adeleye, has denied any link of the OPC members with the institution.  He confirmed the death of Ibraheem, but said he did not die on the university premises. Adeleye, who addressed reporters in his office, said the report he received was that Ibraheem was killed by unknown people. He insisted that the institution had no link with the death of Ibraheem, adding that Redeemer’s University operated a non- violence policy.
