A medical practitioner, Dr Hajarat Davies has emphasised the need for Muslims to create more time for sound sleep during Ramadan. Speaking on Al-Mu’minaat Ramadan lecture aired on Television Continental (TVC), Davies of the Solace Vet Clinic,  said more rest and sound sleep were essential to the overall health of those fasting particularly those engaging in strenuous work. “We need to take time to rest especially during the day. For those engaging in works that are strenuous, there is bound to be a lot of stress. It’s only better for such people to dedicate some time to sleep. “Stress can be controlled. It’s one of the risks we can undergo during fasting. There could also be headache and heartburn. All these conditions can be controlled by maintaining a balance in our rest,” she said. Noting that fasting comes with numerous health benefits, she said the body is naturally resistant to stress while fasting. She identified long life  and improved health as some of the benefits of fasting. She, however, urged the  Muslims to maximise the opportunities of the month. Dr Davies also enjoined   them to go for regular checks and report any strange health condition to the hospital for prompt intervention.
