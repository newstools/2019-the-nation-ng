Unity Bank has faulted the allegation against it by Special Presidential Investigation Panel for Recovery of Public Property (SPIPRPP) that it is keeping funds belonging to Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government. In a statement, the lender said it has conducted itself professionally  by providing all evidence of customers instructions requested by the panel as it relates to all the MDAs. The bank said it  had transferred all the MDAs balances to their respective Treasury Single Accounts in Central Bank of Nigeria as far back in 2016. “Upon approaching the bank in 2018 to conduct investigations on the subject MDAs, Unity Bank, as a responsible corporate citizen, cooperated with the panel accordingly. But out of its own volition, the panel refused to admit further documentary evidence from the Bank when it was obvious that the Bank has no balances kept in its books for the MDAs.”
