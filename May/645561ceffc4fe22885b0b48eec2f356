Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operator of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation joint venture (NNPC/CNL JV), yesterday said the April 18 oil well explosion at the NNPC/CNL JV’s Ojumole Well 1 happened in Ondo State and not Delta State, as reported in the media. A statement by the General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs (G.M, PGPA), Esimaje Brikinn, said Chevron does not have any well called Ikpalakpala-bou among its assets in the Niger Delta. According to him, the oil well name has remained the same over the years. According to Brikinn, a joint investigation visit to the site on April 20, by a team of regulatory agencies, community stakeholders (including representatives of Tsekelewu community) and CNL, determined that the fire was caused by unidentified third-parties who interfered with the facility. The statement reads: “We have been in engagement with all relevant stakeholders, including communities, government of Ondo State and regulatory agencies on the fire. We are currently working with contractors to safely put out the fire as quickly as possible.” Brikinn stressed that CNL prioritises the health and safety of its workforce, the community around its operations and protection of its assets and the environment. He added that there were independent, accredited environmental consultants monitoring the environment, and Chevron’s post incident activities will be consistent with relevant environmental laws, regulations and guidelines. “We continue to conduct our operations safely, reliably and efficiently, with utmost consideration for protection of the people and the environment. CNL takes any threat to its operations seriously, and will inform the relevant law enforcement agencies of such threats. “We encourage stakeholders to embrace dialogue and respect for the rule of law, in resolving any perceived grievances,” Brikinn added.
