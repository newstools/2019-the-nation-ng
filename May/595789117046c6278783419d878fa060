An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court Thursday sentenced a 35-year-old fashion designer, Saka Alao to two years imprisonment for stealing and attempting to kill one Mr Aminu Abubakar. Chief Magistrate, Mr A.A. Fashola convicted Alao after he pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him by the Police. Chief Magistrate, Fashola said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to others who might want to engage in similar acts. Alao, resident at 15, Amuje, Abeokuta Expressway, Lagos was arraigned before the court on a four-count-charge of conspiracy, stealing, assault and attempted murder. Prosecuting Sergeant (Sgt.)

He said a struggle ensued between them, in the process of which he said the defendant pushed is victim into an on-going vehicle on the highway.
