The swearing in of the Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party suffers an initial delay as the convoy of the governor was locked down in traffic along the Liberty Road due to heavy movement of vehicles and persons to the venue. The event slated for 10am started at about 11:20 ten minutes after the arrival of the governor to the venue. The 40,000 capacity Liberty Stadium, Ibadan is presently filled to capacity with thousands of others stranded on the pitch. Owing to the heavy vehicular movement into the venue led to heavy traffic congestion as many people have been stranded on different parts of the routes leading to the stadium. Many people dressed in uniformed outfits of various colours, styles and designs who arrived the venue hours before the commencement of the event got spaces on the viewers stand on the field. Tens of canopies erected outside the stadium also failed to accommodate the large turnout of people who throng the venue to witness the swearing-in ceremony. Dignitaries from different parts of the states and even the Southwest states are also in attendance. The roll call includes the Chief Judge of OyoFayose, Munta Abimbola, the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Former governors, Adebayo Alao-Akala and Dr Omololu Olunloyo, Chief Bode George, Former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose, Chief Olu False and his wife.
