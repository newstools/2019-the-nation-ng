Traders yesterday shut the Computer Village in Ikeja, Lagos,  to protest the planned installation of their ‘Iyaoloja’ and ‘Babaloja’. They told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the Computer Village was an international market that did not need such leaders. An Information Communication Technology (ICT) engineer, Wasiu Agbaje, said the hub was not like regular markets with such leaders. He said installing those would undermine the hub because there was no relationship between technology and ‘Iyaoloja’. “What does the ‘Iyaoloja’ and ‘Babaloja’ have to offer, what value are they going to add to the hub? And what technological innovations are they bringing? ‘“The computer village is not like any other street market where pepper and other things are sold. “It is an international technological hub and it should be treated as such,” Agbaje said. A businessman, who preferred anonymity, said Computer Village was an international market and should be treated as such. He said it would undermine the position of Computer Village internationally as the biggest technological hub in West Africa. He said installing the ‘Iyaoloja’ and ‘Babaloja’ would contradict what the hub was known for  because it is not a regular market. A software developer,  Joseph Efosa, said the Computer Village was not a regular market, adding that such leadership was not needed.
