A RIGHTS group,  Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), has petitioned the police over the death of a ticketer, Mr. Andrew Oboh. He was allegedly killed by the police on February 7. In a petition to the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) and Lagos State Police Commissioner, the group  alleged that Oboh was kicked by  policemen attached to 2 Ijora-Badia Division. The petition signed by CDHR Lagos Chairman Comrade Michael Olokungboye said the investigation of the case would unravel those behind the act. The deceased’s elder sister, Jane Aroghan, alleged that Oboh was killed by the police in February. She alleged that he was shot in the leg, arrested and taken to Ijora Police Station, where he sustained further injuries arising from torture. Aroghan added : ‘’My brother died hours later and his body was dumped in a morgue without the knowledge of his family. “The most painful thing is that my brother was beaten, tortured, killed and his body was dumped in a morgue at Yaba, without the knowledge of his family. The family visited many hospitals on Lagos Mainland and the vicinity before they found his body in a morgue at Yaba.” But former Divisional Police Officer for Ijora-Badia Police Station Rotimi Odutona, a Chief Superintendent, said Oboh died during a shootout with the police in Lagos. He alleged that Oboh was an armed robber. “I can confidently tell you that Andrew Oboh was an armed robber; a notorious one for that matter, who terrorised Ijora and its environs. The area is peaceful now. The police have nothing to hide in this matter,” Odutona added.
