Lekki communities have declared a war on land grabbers, who, according to them, have made life miserable for them. Residents of Ileko Alasia communities in Lekki Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos yesterday urged the government to institutionalize a policy framework that would make the state uncomfortable for land grabbers. They spoke while protesting at Idotun, Lekki, the activities of land grabbers. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, a youth leader, Alhaji Akeem Baduru, said land grabbers had made life uncomfortable for the residents, adding that farmland and others they used for economic activities had been under threat because of the activities of land grabbers. He said during the ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo administration, 60 per cent of the land in the communities was taken over by the government, while the remaining 40 per cent was under threat by land grabbers. Baduru urged the government to come up with a policy framework that would make land grabbersâ€™ activities criminal, to prevent communal violence and enhance peace. The communities that participated in the protest included Idotun, Ileko, Avada, Okun Raye, Itokin villages among others. They appealed to the government to rescue them from the destructive activities of the land grabbers.
