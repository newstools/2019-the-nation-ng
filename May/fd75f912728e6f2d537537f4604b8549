Nigeria began their quest for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup title with a resounding 4-0 victory over Qatar at the Mjieski Stadium, Tychy yesterday. Paul Aigbogun sent out presumably his strongest line-up for the tricky clash, with Muhammad Tijani and Henry Offia leading the lines though Bournemouth’s starlet, Nnamdi Oforboh was only good for a bench role. Maxwell Effiom, one of the most influential players during the team’s last tournament in Niger gave his side the lead twelve minutes in when he tapped home after Qatari goalkeeper, Shehab Mamdouh could only parry skipper Ikouwem Utin’s delivery into his path. The Flying Eagles remained on the ascendancy and double their tally before the half hour, Utin the provider yet again after he held off his marker to play in Henry Offia who finished with aplomb. Manchester City starlet, Tom Dele-Bashiru added a third after the break, slotting home a brilliant effort to cap off a scintillating showing in the middle of the park for his side. And defender Aliyu Salawudeen rounded off the scoring in the 74th minute when he stabbed in the fourth from substitute Akor’s header to compound the woes of their opponent.
