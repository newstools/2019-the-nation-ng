Residents of Fadeyi in Somolu Local Government Area of Lagos State have petitioned Police Commissioner Mu’azu Zubairu over the arrest of four suspected cultists at Fadeyi. Yusuf Waziri, Mufutau Abogunde, Tega Michael and Alabi Sulaimon were arrested by policemen attached to Isheri Olofin Division, during a patrol last Wednesday. According to the police, two AK47 rifles, two Beretta pistols and other arms were recovered from them. The suspects, alleged to be Eiye cultists, were said to be part of a gang known as ‘Ereko boys’, which has been on police watch list. In a May 16 petition through their lawyer Greg I. Aghedo, the residents urged the police to be professional. They alleged that the suspects had been arrested several times and freed by the police. Aghedo said the letter was written on behalf of Ayodele Street and adjoining areas at Fadeyi, and two persons; Mrs. Suliyat Asekun and Kola Olusanya. “Our clients are complainants against the above mentioned persons, who were arrested by men of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) and are in your custody,” the letter read. He said the community had been terrorised “for so long” by “a gang of murderous cultists” and had suffered unsolved crimes, including “the murder of the husband of Mrs. Suliyat Asekun. The case is before the Anti-Homicide Section of the State Criminal Intelligence Investigation Department (SCIID), Yaba.” Fadeyi residents, the letter added, were “willing to assist the police in unravelling a lot of information…and most importantly, we seek justice.” The petition enjoined the police to conduct investigation into the case to determine the suspects’ involvement in the crimes.
