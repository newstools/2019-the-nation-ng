The family of a 14-year-old girl in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, who was allegedly gang-raped by three men will not push the case, an NGO has said. The girl, a resident of a community in Yola called Sangere, had reportedly visited another part of the city called Rumde where she complained to a man that she needed money and the man promised “to do something about it.” An activist, Hauwa Garba, who narrated the story to The Nation, said the man later returned with two other men and they took the girl to a house where they all slept with her all night. Hauwa, who took the matter up under the auspices of a Non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Equal Access Nigeria, said some youths informed her about the incident. “I went out to identify the girl and rescue her,” she said, adding that although a medical test conducted on her showed no infection, she was experiencing pains as a result of the gang-raping and she had to be given drugs. Hauwa said her NGO found it difficult to take up the matter because the girl’s family objected to police investigation and the girl was averse to anything that would prolong the matter. “After investigation by my NGO, I realised that she was not raped in the strict sense of it. I discovered that she is into juvenile prostitution. She agreed to sleep with those men for the N2,000 she needed. She has been avoiding me. She is afraid that I want to stop her from prostitution,” Hauwa said. An Adamawa State senior counsel, who is also a member of the Federation of Women Lawyers, Mrs Lubman Muhammad, quoting  Section 260, Subsection 1(e) of the reversed Penal Code Law of Adamawa State 2018, said the girl was a minor and the men were wrong to have slept with her, whether she consented or not.
