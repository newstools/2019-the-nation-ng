Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has vowed that kidnappers and cultists will face the full weight of the law. According to Wike, his administration has taken steps to plug all loopholes which negate the prosecution of suspected cultists and kidnappers. The governor spoke at the Government House in Port Harcourt yesterday when the Akuku-Toru Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs visited him. He said: “We should do well by ensuring that our children turn a new leaf. Once any cultist or kidnapper is caught, the law will be applied. We will apply the big stick. If any person is caught, the person should forget it. The period they go to the Ministry of Justice to stop them being charged to court is over.” Governor Wike said his administration will support different communities to scale up peace efforts to discourage cultism and kidnapping. He appealed to parents to advise their children against cultism and kidnapping for the stability and development of the state. Wike praised the Akuku-Toru Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs for working to enthrone peace in the area. He also approved the setting up of a peace and security committee for the council. The Amayanabo of Abonnema, Disrael Bob-Manuel, congratulated Wike for his re-election. He praised the governor for standing with the people of Akuku-Toru during their time of despair after the military invasion during the presidential election. King Bob-Manuel said the people have sworn that the kind of bloodletting experienced during the last elections will not re-occur. He appealed to Wike to approve a peace and security committee for the area, and added that the people are also working to improve employment through a relationship with a private investor.
