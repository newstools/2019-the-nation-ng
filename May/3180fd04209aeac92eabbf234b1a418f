Former Ghanaian midfielder, Stephen Appiah, has advised participating teams and players to prepare well for the African Cup of Nations holding in Egypt. He said only good teams would do well in the apex football competition in the continent. Appiah, who was part of the Black Stars team to the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, said in an interview over the weekend at the Agege Stadium, Lagos that he wishes all the teams  operate at their best because it is not going to be easy to win. “The Africa Cup of Nations has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams. We just have to accept it. Players have to be ready for the Nations Cup this time around. It is not like going straight to the quarter-finals, there is the Round of 16 to cross, so it will be difficult. “But I wish all the participating countries the best of luck in the tournament,” he stated. Appiah, when asked who will win the 2019 AFCON, said : “Ghana will definitely win the Nations Cup”.
