Bayelsa State government and the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) are quarrelling over the removal and disposal of wrecks on waterways. The government directed shipping operators in the state to take instructions from the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) on scrapping and removal of ship wreck, but NIWA is contending that it is the sole authority on the matter. According to NIWA, while NIMASA covers the coastal waters, its jurisdiction covers the inland waterways, including rivers, creeks and lakes, thus giving it the sole responsibility to surveying, removing  and disposing of wrecks within the Inland waterways in the country. In a statement by NIWA management, the Authority described comments and announcement by the state government on the electronic media as misleading. The statement read: “The attention of National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has been drawn to a recent announcement on radio and television credited to the Attorney-General of Bayelsa State, Mr. Arthur Andrew Seweni-owor, claiming that the Bayelsa State Ministry of Transport has the authorisation of NIMASA to function as receiver of wrecks within the Inland Waterways of Bayelsa State. “We hereby refute as follows: The act establishing NIWA, CAP 47 LFN 2004, particularly part II Section 9 (d), part iv Section 28 (2) empowers NIWA as the sole agency for survey, removal and disposal of wrecks within the Inland waterways in Nigeria. “That NIMASA’s jurisdiction does not conflict with that of NIWA. While NIMASA covers the coastal waters, NIWA’s jurisdiction covers the inland waterways, including rivers, creeks and lakes. “Consequently, any person or organisation involved in salvaging, cutting, scrapping or disposing of wrecks within the Inland waterways of Bayelsa State, and indeed Nigeria, is advised to obtain the necessary clearance from NIWA. Failure to do so may lead to severe sanctions.”
