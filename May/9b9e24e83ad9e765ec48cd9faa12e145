THE Ogun State governor-elect, Dapo Abiodun, will have a mountain to climb to succeed as governor after his inauguration on May 29. This is on account of the booby trap his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun is believed to be setting for him as he prepares to hand over the baton of governance. Like a bolt from the blue, the outgoing governor has suddenly become the friend of the state’s civil servants who for years had fought in vain for their promotion, pension and other basic entitlements under his administration. The recruitments and promotion he had bluntly refused to do for years are now being done with such haste and excitement that the people of the state are left to wonder the alchemy by which the state’s workers suddenly became the apple of Amosun’s eyes. One explanation is that the outgoing governor wants to balloon the wage bill of the state so that the incoming governor would have a heavy wage bill to contend with when he gets into office. Nobody knows what Dapo intends to do about the booby trap, as he has not complained, at least publicly, like other governors-elect.
