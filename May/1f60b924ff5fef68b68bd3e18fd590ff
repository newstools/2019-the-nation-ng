Nigeria’s Taiwo Awoniyi, who plays at Royal Excel Mouscron, has hinted that he would love to get the chance to prove himself under parent club, Liverpool, AOIFootball.com reports Awoniyi has arguably been one of the best loan players this term for the Kops and will be willing to create an encouraging display when he returns at the end of the season to Liverpool. Speaking in an exclusive with AOIFootball.com, the 21- year-old said he would fancy his chances for the new season. “The goal for me has always been to be better than who I was before. I believe since joining the club I’ve not been the same player I was, and that is the most important thing; doing your best and praying God crowns your efforts. “If eventually I’m granted the work permit, then I believe I would prove myself. Even when I impress without the work permit it will be difficult to be in the coach’s plan but the goal has always been to work hard and hope for the best. “If it happens one day, glory to God, if not, it’s not the end of the world. The future is long and bright that I believe,” Awoniyi said. Awoniyi joined the Belgian side in the January transfer window and was on the scoresheet in their recent 3-0 victory against Sv Zulte Waregem in the first division playoffs. He has been clinical in front of goal this term, raking in a total of 8 goals in 13 matches, having started on 11 occasions.
