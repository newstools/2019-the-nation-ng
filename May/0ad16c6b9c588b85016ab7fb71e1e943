President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the Super Falcons for putting up a superlative performance that saw them emerging as 2019 WAFU Women’s Cup Champions, with an unbeaten record throughout the tournament. President Buhari in a congratulatory message in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Sunday, lauded the Falcons for their fighting spirit and resplendent skills evidenced in team work, discipline and focus, which enabled them to defeat the Ivorian Dame Elephantes at the finals of the championship. The President extolled all officials and management of the team, led by Thomas Dennerby, for their sacrifice, commitment and diligence in winning the championship. Buhari urged the officials and players to stay focused and unleash the same zeal that won the WAFU Women’s Cup Champions as they prepared for the forthcoming FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, the eighth edition, holds from June 7 to July 7 in France.
