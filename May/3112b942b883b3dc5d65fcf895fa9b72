Talking about periods shouldn’t be one big talk at a particular age. Instead, start the conversation early and slowly build on your child’s understanding. Girls and boys need reliable information about periods. So make sure you talk to your sons too! 1 Talk about menstruation with your daughter as early as possible. Most girls get their first period when they’re between 10 and 15 years old so you should be ready to deliver the talk as soon as she asks about anything. 2 When her first period starts, this is the time to have a more in-depth discussion. 3 Don’t just let your daughter watch a video or give her a book to read. This doesn’t really allow her to remember or ask questions. 4 Have your daughter write down any of her questions. This is the perfect place for her to write down answers as well. 5 Always ask “What have you heard?” Since girls talk quite a bit, it is a good idea to find what your daughter thinks she knows. This is a great time to dispel any myths or correct anything that is false. 6 Help her pick out just the right products. 7 Discuss hygiene and how to take care of yourself. 8 Share ways to feel better and deal with things like cramps, etc. 9 Share your own experience with your daughter.
