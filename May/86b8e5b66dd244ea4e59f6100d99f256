Bishop of Owo Diocese, Methodist Church Nigeria, Revd Solomon Adegbite has urged church members and other well-meaning Nigerians to support the faith-based Wesley University, Ondo to meet its mission in academic lifeline. The cleric pleaded with all stakeholders to do everything possible to rescue the university’s licence from being revoked by relevant agencies. Revd Adegbite spoke at the 31st annual Diocesan Synod held at the Methodist Church, Ehin-Ogbe, Owo, in Ondo state last weekend. He noted that church ministers have always paid substantially to jerk up what was being remitted on behalf of the Diocese. “Some of us were trained in Methodist Primary, Secondary and even Colleges.  Some people contributed to build those schools. What are we contributing as a people and generation to bequeath to the next generation that will add value to them? This University is one of such. “Let us do our best to make Wesley University a place to be proud of,” he said. Adegbite reiterated the agreement reached at Aba conference that whatever was paid either by the church or individuals would be turned to shares which to attract dividend in the future. The cleric thanked all Methodist Church members, especially in Owo Diocese, for their support and cooperation in the past seven years he has been in their midst. He said though they had not reached their destination by his own vision and projection, but actually started the upward movement to the area.
