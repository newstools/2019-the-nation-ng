The Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Oilserv Group, Emeka Okwuosa, has said that  the company will complete its part of the Obiafu-Obrikom -Oben (OB3) gas pipeline by September this. In an interview with reporters at the just-concluded Offshore Technokogy Conference, in Houston, Texas, Okwuosa said the project is on course and will be completed in September. He said the project is quite challenging, adding that  the company has always shown commitment in the process of executing the project from the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) stages. He stressed that the  Gas Treatment Plant (GTP) is the largest in Nigeria and by extension Africa, with a capacity of two billion standard cubic feet of gas per day (2bscf/d). On project delay, he said few changes in the entire design concept alongside some shortcomings led to some setbacks in the initial delivery date. Oilserv, a leading Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Installation and Commissioning Company in Nigeria has been a major player in the industry since inception in 1992 and has contributed immensely to the development of pipelines systems infrastructure in Nigeria having executed various large and medium scale projects. “No pipeline of this size and capacity has been built in Nigeria. You will recall that in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, we have the likes of Wilbros and others that were not Nigerians firms, handling the pipeline construction. Even at that, if you look at all pipeline infrastructure today, you cannot equate it with the pipelines built by Oilserv. “Let us also put it in perceptive that it is not about the pipeline. We have the GTP at Oben, which is the heart of our scope. The GTP will handle two billion standard cubic feet of gas per day. This has never existed anywhere in Africa. “You have to be there and see the massive nature of the pipeline. When you talk about building OB3, is not just building a pipeline,” he said.
