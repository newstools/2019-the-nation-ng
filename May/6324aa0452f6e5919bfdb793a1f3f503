 Super Eagles group opponents at the 2019 Nations cup in Egypt, Swallows of Burundi are to get regular supply of milk while the championship lasts. The Swallows are making their debut at the Nations cup and the Football Federation of Burundi (FFB) is calling for all hands to be on deck in support of the team as they confront, three time Nations cup winners Nigeria, Guinea and fellow debutants Madagascar. President of the federation Révérien Ndikuriyo was quoted by local media as reminding Burundians that The Swallows known locally as Intamba mu Rugamba are not only going to represent the country but indeed every Burundian who is obliged to offer maximum support in any way possible. The clarion call appears to be yielding result as a Dairy company in the country has announced its readiness to supply the boys with continuous fresh milk to ensure they don’t lack strength. Director General of Modern Dairy Burundi (MDB) Juma Mohamed did not only donate $10,000 (About N3.6million) in support of the team but also declared that the company will supply the boys with milk while in Egypt. “We will install tanks from which players will fetch milk during their training. They will also have enough milk during their stay in Egypt,” he assured in a chat with local media Iwacu. Burundi shocked hot favorites Gabon during the last lap of the qualifiers holding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang led squad to a 1-1 in match some analysts had predicted the Panthers will win. Burundi will open their campaign at the Nations cup on the 22nd of June against Super Eagles.  They will then tackle fellow debutants Madagascar on June 27 before rounding off their group matches with a clash with Syli Nationale of Guinea on June 30th. Although some have described the Eagles versus Swallows match as a walk in the park many however say it would be a mistake to underrate a debutant team that has nothing to lose but determined to put everything to make a mark.
