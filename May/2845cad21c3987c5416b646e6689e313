Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Special Offences Court yesterday sentenced two men, Suleiman Sanni and Taiwo Ibrahim, to three years imprisonment for unlawful association and stealing. But the court freed Kola Ibrahim for want of evidence. The convicts were found guilty of armed robbery, unlawful possession of fire arms and stealing. Five witnesses, including the police investigator and the complainants, testified in the case. Justice Taiwo held that there was no evidence linking Kola Ibrahim to the crime. The judge admonished him to desist from unlawful association and maintain peace and order in Ijeshatedo, Lagos. She held that the prosecution  proved the case of membership of unlawful society and stealing against the convicts. But she noted that it did not prove the case of armed robbery against them. Justice Taiwo said : “I hereby find the first and third defendants guilty and convict them for being members of unlawful society. “The third defendant is also convicted of stealing N38, 000,” she said. The defendants’ counsel, Mrs. A.O. Adeyemi, in her mitigation plea, urged the court to temper justice with mercy. “My lord, the defendants have been of good behaviour since they were granted bail and they have been attending court regularly. They are first time offenders. We urge the court to give them lesser punishment,” she pleaded. In her judgment, Justice Taiwo sentenced the convicts to one year imprisonment for being members of unlawful society and for breach of the peace. She  sentenced Taiwo Ibrahim to two years imprisonment for stealing.
