After experiencing drought this year in the last three tournaments, Sunday Olapade will be taking his title chase to the 62nd Asantehene Golf Championship in Kumasi, Ghana. Already aiming to defend his title at next week’s Port Harcourt Classics, Olapade who is one of the Nigerians invited for the tournament this week, believes he can regain his form with the Ghana tournament. The five-day tournament tees off today at the Royal Golf Club in Kumasi and Olapade will be up against homeboys – Vincent Togar and Amos Koblar as well as other top African stars heading to Kumasi for the championship. With winner carting home $3500, the tournament is staged annually as part of the 20th anniversary celebration of the coronation of Asantehene, who is the royal father of Asante. A confident Olapade said: “I’m very excited to be playing in this year’s   Asantehene Golf Championship in Kumasi, because because Ghana is one of my favourite country. The likes of Vincent Togar, Amos Koblar and other strong players that will be participating in the event are my main focus. Also the professional players over there are all good but I think the tables will turn this year as I am hoping for a win at the event.” He added: “I really want to win this event and I want to break the course record of 6 under there and set a new one.” Olapade who finished 6th in his last campaign at the event with a six over par over 72 Hole is hoping to end the event on a high note by securing a win. He is also hoping to use the tournament to shape up for his title defense on the African Tours’ 4th Port Harcourt Classics next week at the Port Harcourt Golf Club in Rivers State. Jos-based Izang Ayuba will be joining Olapade in the tournament in Ghana.
