A Lagos High Court in Igbosere on Wednesday heard that a former Super Eagles’ captain, Augustine Jay-Jay Okocha, is yet to liquidate his alleged tax debt owed the Lagos State Government. The government’s lawyer, Mrs Y. A. Pitan, told Justice Adedayo Akintoye that Okocha had visited the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) office, but failed to settle the 2017 income tax evasion charge out of court. The judge, like she did last April 15, renewed a warrant for Okocha’s arrest. The warrant was originally made last January 29. Like in previous proceedings, Okocha was neither in court nor represented by a lawyer when the case was called. Pitan informed the court of steps the prosecution had taken to effect the arrest warrant. “The LIRS informed us that the defendant (Okocha) visited their office. He went there to reconcile accounts. He hasn’t settled yet,” she said. “So, what do you want the court to do,” the judge asked. Pitan prayed for more time following which Justice Akintoye adjourned till October 10, 2019. According to the government, the ex-Bolton Wanderers of England captain has failed to appear in court since October 5, 2017, when the case first came up. The government filed a three-count charge against Okocha on June 6, 2017, accusing him of: “Failure to furnish return of income for tax purposes with the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service contrary to Section 94 (1) of the Personal Income Tax Act Cap P8 Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 2004 (As Amended). “Failure to pay income tax contrary to Section 56(a) and (b) of the Lagos State Revenue Administration Law No. 8 of 2006. “Failure to furnish return of Income for tax purposes with the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service contrary to Section 94(1)of the Personal Income Tax Act Cap P8 Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 2004 (As Amended).”
