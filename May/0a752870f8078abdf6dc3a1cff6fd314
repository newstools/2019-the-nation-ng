Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has congratulated the President of the Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE), Mrs. Funke Egbemode, on her re-election at the guild’s 13th annual conference in Lagos. In a statement by his Media and Publicity Coordinator, Mr. Jide Orintunsin, the governor noted that Mrs Egbemode’s re-election was a testimony and acceptability of the leadership virtues of the Nigerian woman. The governor said her re-election as NGE President in a male-dominated profession, further showed the Nigerian woman as capable and competent for any leadership position. He recalled that during Egbemode’s first term, she successfully built on the solid foundation laid by the founding fathers of the guild by repositioning it for the challenges of a 21st century journalism profession. “I congratulate Mrs. Funke Egbemode on her re-election as the President of the NGE. Your re-election speaks volumes of the leadership virtues and capabilities of Nigerian women. I am convinced that your return was an endorsement of the leadership you gave to the guild in the last two years. “I also rejoice with other members of the newly elected Executive Council of the guild. Your election is coming at a crucial time in the history of our nation; at a time fake and hate speeches dominate social media platforms. As gatekeepers of the fourth estate of the realm, I challenge you to judiciously use your tenure to checkmate this ugly trend and salvage journalism profession.”
