Ogun State Police Command yesterday paraded four herdsmen, who allegedly terrorised four communities in Imeko/Afon Local Government. The suspects: Abubakar Umar, Momo Mohammed, Lawal Aliyu and Abubakar Muhammed, were arrested in the on-going Operation “Puff Adder” launched by the Acting Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. The quartet were believed to be among the over 200 armed herdsmen who invaded Iwoye border town and its three adjourning communities of Oke-Agbede, Moriwi and Wasinmi-Okuta last week with their cattle, which led to the death of two villagers, 28-year-old Kabiru Ogunrinde and Segun Fakorede, 30. Two other hunters from the neighbouring Republic of Benin were also killed during the attack, while some operatives attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) were wounded in a gun duel that later ensued. Two swords, a Dane gun, knives, cutlasses and charms were recovered from the herdsmen when the operatives stormed Imeko/Afon Local Government in search of them. The police Divisional Crime Officer (DCO) was shot during a gun duel between the police and the herdsmen. Police Commissioner Baahir Manama, who paraded the suspects at the command’s headquarters at Eleweran, said the arrest was in furtherance of Operation “Puff Adder.”
