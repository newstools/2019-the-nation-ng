A veteran journalist, Alhaji Kola Animashaun is dead. He died yesterday in Lagos. He was 80. His remains were interred at a cemetery in Agege according to Islamic rites. The national leadership and the Lagos State chapter of the Muslim Media Practitioners of Nigeria (MMPN) yesterday commiserated with the Animashauns. A joint statement by MMPN’s National President Alhaji Abdurrahman Balogun and Lagos State Chairman Alhaji Kabir Alabi Garba, described the deceased as an “iconic journalist.” The duo said: “Alhaji Animashaun bestrode firmament of Nigerian media landscape as a colossus and inspired in us the virtues of dedication, excellence and forthrightness in journalism. An icon of our age, he played a frontline role in the formation and sustainability of our association.  He was a warm and welcoming person who had a lasting impression at first encounter with anybody. “His skill as a journalist and public opinion moulder shone brightly in his weekly column, Voice of Reason in the Vanguard, as his style as simple as it is, is very compelling, making journalism attractive for us as an influential calling. “Alhaji Animashaun will be remembered for many giants in journalism that he mentored to prominence.” Balogun said the nation has lost a true voice of reason, “who intervenes with his lucid and informed commentaries at critical times in the life of the nation. It is not too much if we celebrate his life and times as a nationalist or nation builder. “We are comforted that our doyen in journalism departed on a beautiful note, in the glorious month of Ramadan and during the last ten days when Muslims globally become more dedicated in ibaadaat in the search for the night of majesty – Lailatulqadr. In this, we say alhamdulillah for a gracious transition.” Garba prayed to Allah to give the late Animashaun’s family the fortitude to bear “his passage.”
