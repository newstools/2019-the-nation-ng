The Port Harcourt Area One Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) collected N17,826,222,668.31 for the first quarter of 2019, its Area Controller, Mohammed Bande Boyi, has said. In a statement, the Area One Public Relations Officer (PRO), Oscar Ivara, said the figure is N4,436,822,181 above what was collected in the same period last year. Boyi attributed the feat to higher volume of vessels at the port, more commitment by the command’s officers and regular interaction with stakeholders to achieve compliance. He applauded freight forwarders, licensed customs agents, shipping lines and other operators at the port for their cooperation. The Controller expressed optimism that the command would surmount its 2019 target with support from other sister government agencies and various customs  units, such as the Strike Force.
