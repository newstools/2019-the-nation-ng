It was a mixed feelings on Tuesday at the Imo State Government House as the outgoing governor,  Rochas Okorocha formally vacated the governor’s lodge in a colourful ceremony. Political appointees and aides caved into emotion and wept openly as they witnessed the dramatic pulling out of the governor and the lowering of the flag of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Security agents had a hectic time trying to control the crowd of supporters who thronged the Government House to catch the last glimpse of the governor before he finally bows out. After the formalities, the governor was escorted in a long motorcade to his private residence in Spibat, a sprawling area of Owerri,  the state capital. The governor said that in his eight years of administration, he never broke the law as speculated. According to him: “I have not broken the law, I only bend to achieve results. I do things the other way and I get results. I remember in 2011 when darkness ravaged and people cannot go out for fear of being kidnapped but today Imo is a secured state. “So I can say that I came, I saw and I conquered.  I am not here to make speeches on my achievements but I want to tell you about the Imo state that I want to handover. I encourage you to support the new government in power”. He added: “The office of the governor is a seal covering people, it is like a mask covering me and if you remove that mask you will see the real Rochas that is bigger than the governor.  Let those that are fighting stop as i leave the Government House today”.
