Former Super Eagles striker, Jonathan Akpoborie has stressed the need to demand more from Super Eagles’ handler, Gernot Rohr. In a chat with Sports247, Akpoborie said that although Rohr has been able to qualify the Super Eagles for the Nations Cup, the nation deserves more in terms of the pattern of play of the team. “He’s not really a bad coach and at the same time he’s not really the best, but we must give it to him because he was the one that took the Eagles from the level they were before to where they are right now. But as a nation, we shouldn’t be satisfied because we are ambitious and we want everything. “If any Nigerian tells me that Rohr is the best or he’s still going to take us forward, I will not believe that because I have studied how they play football in Europe and I have seen where youths develop into full professionals”, he stated. Akpoborie went further in highlighting the importance of a very good technical director in the country stating that this would build the foundation for a solid football philosophy for the country. Rohr would lead the Super Eagles to his second major tournament in Egypt having guided the side to the Russia 2018 World Cup.
