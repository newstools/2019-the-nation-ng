The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has remitted N5 billion to the Federation Account in 2019. This is against the N8 billion it returned to the government purse last year. JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, confirmed this in an interview yesterday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Benjamin said the government directed the agency to take N2 billion from the N5 billion to enhance its operations. He said: “For 2019, we have returned N5 billion to the Federal Treasury. However, government has directed that we take N2 billion to enhance our operations. “This is below (the N8 billion) returned last year because government had reduced the price of the forms. “By the time you calculate the N1,500 that has been cut from the price, we would have realised much more than that.”
