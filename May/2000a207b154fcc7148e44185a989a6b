Hearing in the trial of Offa robbery suspects could not continue yesterday due to the absence of a leading prosecution witness. The five accused persons in the incident, Ayoade Akinnibosun, Ibikunle Ogunleye, Adeola Abraham, Salahudeen Azeez and Niyi Ogundiran, are standing trial on charges of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide and armed robbery. At the resumed hearing of the case yesterday before Justice Haleema Salman of the Kwara State High Court, the leading prosecution counsel, Prof Wahab Egbewole (SAN), told the court that the security crisis in Zamfara State prevented the prosecution witness from being in Ilorin for the case. He prayed the court to adjourn the case. Defence counsel Mathias Emeribe did not object to the request. Justice Salman had on April 8 adjourned ruling on the admissibility of the five accused’s confessional statements to a later date. The prosecution and defence counsel had argued on admissibility of the accused’s confessional statements, as the defence counsel maintained that the statements were obtained under duress and should not be admitted in evidence. Already, the court had admitted in evidence the medical examination report on the wounds allegedly inflicted on the suspects during their interrogation by the police. Justice Salman adjourned the case till June 6 and 7 for continuation of hearing.
