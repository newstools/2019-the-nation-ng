Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede, has advised new students of the university to make efforts to succeed. Ogunbodede spoke at the university’s matriculation held at the Amphitheatre in Oduduwa Hall. He congratulated the fresh students, saying that of the 37, 059 students who applied for admission, only 6,650 were lucky. Ogunbodede said the institution has been able to produce manpower as well as experts that meet the needs of both the nation and the international community across all fields. He appealed to the new students to maintain the standard of knowledge and intellectual excellence the school had been known for globally. He also admonished them to face their studies squarely by combining academic excellence with culture in a challenging, competitive and diverse environment. Ogunbodede advised them to have role models especially among the lecturers, and seek counsel from the right channels, especially from the Students Affairs unit, as well as the institution’s Health Centre. The VC advised them to keep away from bad company who might want to lure them into social vices. “The university seriously frowns on all forms of anti-social behaviours that are capable of disrupting the smooth running of its academic calendar. Therefore, we implore you to desist from anti-social displays,” Ogunbodede warned. Two of the new students Ayodeji Aduloju, and Ayandokun Tolulope of the departments of Political Science and English respectively, thanked the school authority for making their dream a reality. “OAU has been my dream school from the onset. I love OAU and I’ll make sure I make my parents proud and one day make OAU proud too,”  Aduloju said.
