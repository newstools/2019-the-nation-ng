Samuel Chukwueze has decided to obey the wishes of his La Liga club Villarreal by shunning the chance to represent Nigeria at the U20 World Youth World Cup and he will now focus on playing for Nigeria at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Chukwueze was initially open to the idea of representing Nigeria at both tournaments but Villarreal were opposed to the idea, insisting he could only play in one of the two tournaments. Coach of the Super Eagles of Nigeria Gernot Rohr also confirmed the directives from Villarreal and Chukwueze has now opted out of the Nigeria U20 team in preference for the senior national team. Villarreal’s instruction is based on the fact that he risks a burn-out if he plays in both tournaments and furthermore he is expected to also play for Nigeria U23s in their qualifiers in June. “Chukwueze has decided to play for Nigeria at the AFCON and not the U20 World Youth Championship. His decision has been communicated to the coaches of the U20s and Rohr as well. It’s a professional decision for the good of his career “, a member of his management team exclusively told Owngoalnigeria.com.
