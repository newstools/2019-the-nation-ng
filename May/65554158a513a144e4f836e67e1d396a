He said: “We, governors, have one unwritten policy: we don’t openly interfere with the issues of one another. We only play background roles to lobby and appeal. “I cannot dictate to Ganduje how he should run Kano, but we can work un derground as bridge builders. God willing, the Governor and the Emir will come back together as one.” He said that he is particularly close to both Ganduje and Sanusi. His words: “Governor Ganduje and his highness, the Emir of Kano have done some things that eternally dear to the people of Borno, to me in particular. “Governor Ganduje has adopted and granted lifetime scholarship from primary to University levels to 200 orphans from Borno State whose parents were killed by Boko Haram. “These children are provided with accommodation, feeding and being given very good �education in Kano State under a special welfare programme that the Governor approved. “On the other hand, the Emir of Kano was our main link to Alhaji Aliko Dangote. In 2016, the Emir was in Borno and on seeing the humanitarian situation, he spoke to Alhaji Aliko Dangote and Dangote has been to Borno State more than 3 times. “He has given the highest individual and private sector support to our humanitarian course and I will never forget that the Emir of Kano was the link. As CBN Governor, the Emir brought the CBN entrepreneurship development center to Borno State back in 2013 or so. “He helped in raising global local and global awareness to our situation in Borno. I will never forget the empathy shown to us by the Emir of Kano as well as Governor Ganduje and this is why I play the role of a bridge builder.” My stewardship, by Shettima Shettima believes that the forum under his leadership in the past four years has made modest achievements despite security challenges. He said: “Within this period, we have been able to collectively make some modest achievements in various sectors, which are deliberately initiated and im THE plemented for the overall growth and development of the Northern region and, to some extent, Nigeria as a whole. “In the face of the increasing security challenges, especially emergent criminal activities such as kidnapping, cattle rustling, incessant communal clashes, inciting religious preachings and suicide bombings among others, most of which were not properly codified in the criminal justice system of Northern Nigeria, we found it judicially imperative to incorporate such criminal offences into the penal code. “The Forum, therefore established a committee of Attorneys-General of the 19 Northern States to critically examine the provisions of the criminal justice system vis-à-vis, the emergent criminal activities, with a view to ensuring that perpetrators of such criminal offences are brought to justice. “Accordingly, the forum advised all State Houses of Assembly in the 19 Northern States to make amendments and modifications to the existing criminal justice system. “Sequel to persistent reports of drug abuse, especially among the youths and women in the Northern States, the Forum initiated the move to fight the menace in a holistic and all-encompassing manner by setting up committees of relevant stakeholders in each State of the region towards ensuring eliminating the scourge of drug abuse. “At the National level, the Forum made a passionate appeal to the Federal Government to frontally deal with the issue of drug abuse and possibly declare a state of emergency in the fight against the scourge. It is gratifying to note that the Federal Government has heeded our call, which culminated in the setting up of the Marwa Committee against drug abuse.” The governor also disclosed that the Forum, in a bid to attain some degree of financial independence, resolved to create a joint financial institution which could serve as a vehicle for the region’s economic recovery and overall sectoral development. “In pursuance of this objective, each state is to contribute N50 million monthly, for a period of six months. So far, we have N650 million out of the expected N5.7 billion,” he said. He called on states that were yet to fulfil their pledge to do so in order to enable the forum embark on the implementation of the various programmes and projects articulated under the scheme. Some of the projects, he said, include the establish ment of a renewable energy plant, capable of generating 3000 – 4000MW of electricity. “The Forum has also been able to make pragmatic initiatives towards the resuscitation of the New Nigeria Development Company in ortder to restore its position as the business and economic live-wire of the region. “To this end, about six billion naira was approved by the Forum for the implementation of a five-year strategic development plan, which if properly executed would undoubtedly propel the region into economic prosperity. “In addition, a new commodity marketing company was established as a subsidiary of the NNDC, to develop and promote agricultural activities in the region. “In order to further consolidate the economic base of the region, the NNDC had signed a memoran dum of understanding with Savanna Petroleum Limited for the development of four oil blocks. “Additionally, the NNDC has commenced negotiations with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to venture into oil and gas exploration in the Northern region.” He further disclosed that plans are underway to resuscitate the Kaduna Textiles Company into full production of textile materials, which hopefully would, among other things, “meet the uniform needs of our Armed Forces and other para-military agencies. “I appeal to Your Excellencies to extend similar support and cooperation to my successor. I also appeal to Your Excellencies for your forgiveness if during my tenure as Chairman of the Forum, I had offended you in one way or another.”
