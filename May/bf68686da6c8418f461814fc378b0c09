the contingent of Lagos State for lesser hajj (Umrah) will leave Nigeria for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia today. Secretary of the state Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board (LSMPWB), Mr Ishola Rahman said the pilgrims are to be conveyed by two air carriers – Etihad and Emirate. “Those going with Etihad are expected to arrive at the airport by 6am and to leave by 9am while those travelling on Emirate are expected at the airport by 9am to leave by 12 noon. We hope to arrive the Kingdom on Thursday,” he said. According to him, pilgrims should observe the time rules in order to make the checking-in easier and smooth. “We have taken time out to organise a seminar for the pilgrims where they were enlightened on the dos and don’ts of Umrah and to ensure that no one fall victim of the laws of the Holy Land,” he said. The Chairman of the Board, Dr. Tajudeen Yusuf, warned pilgrims against all banned and contraband items. He cautioned them against carrying overload, pointing out that pilgrims are only entitled to two 23 kg bags with 10kg hand bag. He urged them to be good ambassadors of Nigeria and Lagos in particular in the kingdom. Dr. Yusuf enjoined the pilgrims to keep their properties safe, particularly their international passports and the visa printout as misplacing it could jeopardise their journey to the holy land. The board Chairman appealed to the pilgrims to pray for Lagos State Government. The pilgrims, The Nation learnt, are to spend 10 days in the Kingdom before returning back to the country on June 7.
