The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has flayed recent comment by former President Olusegun Obasanjo on fulanisation and islamisation of the country. The pro-Biafran group described the comment as belated. Obasanjo was reported to have bemoaned the high level of insecurity in the country, regretting that the acts of violence being perpetrated by Boko Haram and herdsmen were being treated with kids gloves. But IPOB in a statement on Sunday by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, accused Obasanjo and other Nigerian leaders of conspiracy of silence in the trouble with Nigeria. It argued that the number of casualties would have been minimal if the former president had spoken out earlier against the so-called fulanisation and islamisation of the country. The group regretted that while its leader, Nnamdi Kanu was kicking against the misrule in the country, leaders like Obasanjo assumed an indifferent disposition. The statement read in part, “We say good morning to the former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is only now merely echoing what our leader, Nnamdi Kanu has been saying repeatedly for years. “The same way the high and mighty in Nigeria has now conceded to the inevitability of the destructive Fulanisation agenda championed by APC, one day they will swallow their pride and also concede that Nnamdi Kanu was also right about Jubril Al-Sudani all along. “Had the likes of Obasanjo spoken out earlier when our leader repeatedly warned of what was happening, many innocent victims of Fulani herdsmen would still be alive today, many ethnically cleansed communities in the Middle Belt would have been sparred also.”
