Just as the definition of insurance which screams uncertainty, residents in Lagos and Ogun State last week woke up to an unexpected downpour, leading to damage of vehicles by fallen trees. Houses, telecommunications infrastructure and other properties were also destroyed by the wind and flood that came with it. The rain which came in torrents, with rising floods and wind blowing, lasted about two hours. It particularly uprooted a tree that fell on a jeep and car at Alfred Rewane, Ikoyi, Lagos, damaging the vehicle. Experts said for the unexpected that befell the owners of the two vehicles, is the reason vehicle owners should have a Comprehensive Motor Insurance. The Nation also learnt that the government, it was said, can also pay compensation in this instance, as it planted the trees that fell on vehicles. The Director-General, Nigeria Insurers Association (NIA), Mrs Yetunde Ilori, called on Nigerians to insure their lives and properties against the unexpected. She said owners of the two vehicles can make insurance claims if they have Comprehensive Insurance and not Third Party Insurance. She also said that the Federal Government also ought to have Liability Insurance Cover for trees that they plant of roads. This, according to her, will cover loss that may occur to citizens using the roads. She said: “A vehicle with Comprehensive Cover will be compensated but not the one with Third Party. Ordinarily, it is a public liability for which government should be responsible. But I doubt if the government has such cover. There might also be a law somewhere by which government relieves itself of such obligation. Someone can test the law by suing the government and this is why they should endeavour to have liability cover.” She advised Nigerians on the need to build a solid financial footing after working so hard. She said accidents and disasters can and do happen, and if you aren’t adequately insured, it could leave you in financial ruin.
