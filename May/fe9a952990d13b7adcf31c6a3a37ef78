To some people, you need a huge budget to travel or explore your favorite destinations. This is not necessarily the case as you can still travel without emptying your account or incurring debt. These suggestions as shared by Jumia, Nigeria’s leading online travel agency will help you travel the world without breaking the bank. Book your flight months ahead This is one of the most important tips that you should follow. The earlier you book your flight with Jumia’s hotel and flight marketplace, the cheaper the flight will be. While it might seem like a lot of commitment to book this far ahead, the benefits it will serve in the long run will be immense. Go for package deals Package deals can be a great way to save money on a trip. Again, Jumia’s hotel and flight marketplace have quite affordable packages to some of your favourite destinations like Dubai, South Africa, London, Cape Town, Accra and France among others. Regardless, it is important to do an extensive amount of homework before committing. But the value of finding a good one could be tremendous. Travel in a group An excellent way to save money is by having other people come along for the ride. While this largely depends on who you feel comfortable travelling with (as well as for how long), consider bringing a group together to cut costs down. Barter with other travellers Trading with other travellers can be a great way to save money. You never know who might be willing to host you in exchange for you doing the same. Additionally, certain things could go far on the road, so don’t discount what you and others might find valuable. Focus on what’s free The world is filled with things you can do that are 100 percent free. If you work from there and establish your upfront costs as to what you find valuable, you can not only travel for a long time but see some of the most incredible sights you’d ever imagine.
