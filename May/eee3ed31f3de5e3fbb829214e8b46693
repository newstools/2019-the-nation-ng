THE Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) has thrown its weight  behind the law making building collapse an offence, its National President Charles Alabo, has said. Alabo spoke at the institute’s investiture in Owerri, the Imo State capital. He said this would ensure the right materials and expertise were used. He said henceforth, the institute would monitor building construction. Such checks, he said, would help to curb the menace of frequent building collapse. “When a building collapses, they would include surveyors; we can only test the loamy soil. We are not the geo-technical engineers, it does not concerns us. Where I think we should come in is the monitoring aspect of it. We are going to urge the National Assembly to pass the law  on building monitoring,” he said. Alabo exonerated surveyors from the incidents because they were not responsible for materials used in construction. However, he pointed out that if the monitoring bill is passed, it will become the responsibility of the surveyors to monitor the construction of building from its sand texture level to its completion. The new fellows are Gertrude Njar, Dupe Olayinka, Solomon Olukotun, Babatunde Oluwasunkanmi and O. B. Ogunlami.
