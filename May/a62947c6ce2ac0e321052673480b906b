There was pandemonium in the popular Kawo area of Kaduna metropolis, as stray bullet from men of the Nigeria Police killed an innocent resident. Residents of the area however took to the Kaduna-Zaria and Kaduna-Lagos highways, blocking roads and burning tyres in protest to the killing. The Nation gathered that, trouble started when residents of Kawo area in the early hours of Monday received information that, there are some kidnappers numbering about three, attempting to abduct some members of the community. The residents according to an eye witness immediately blocked roads leading in and out of the community and chased down the kidnappers and along the line, one of the kidnappers was caught and burnt instantly.

An eyewitness, Sadi Dauda said “I sighted large crowd from afar and immediately rushed down. Kawo community people received information that some kidnappers numbering about three were operating in Sabon Kawo and immediately blocked the roads. “They chased down the kidnappers and killed one of them. Immediately police got to the scene, they started shooting sporadically to scare away people and they shot an innocent person dead. They shot 4 people in the process one is dead and the remaining three are in Kawo General Hospital. “Now the residents are protesting that the kidnapper in the police custody be released so that they can do instant justice. They said they won’t leave unless he is released.” Dauda narrated.
