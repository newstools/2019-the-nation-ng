The Managing Director, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Mr. Ernest Mupwaya, at the weekend said that the company is set to rollout 900,000 under the Meter Asset Provider (MAP). This is just as the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) pointed out that MAP regulation has stopped the electricity Distribution Companies from collecting energy and service charges after two weeks of power outage. Its chairman, Prof. James Momoh, broke the news at the AEDC launch of the MAP in Abuja. The MAP regulation, according to the General Manager, Finance and Management Services, Mr. Abudukadir Shetima, who represented him, has insisted that the meters must be installed not later than 10 days after payment. He added that should the DisCo refuse to replace a malfunctioning meter after two days, the customer is not expected to make any payment. He noted that the commission, the distribution companies, and the customers have their deadline in order to provide the meters to the customers at the required time. Speaking, the AEDC Managing Director, Engr. Ernest Mupwaya, revealed that altogether the company has planned to meter the customers in its franchise areas with 900,000 meters. He said that bearing in mind that the customers would increase, the meter vendors would also cater for their metering. He said that “In all, 900,000 customs have been scheduled for metering in AEDC franchise area in the first instance. Being a moving target, we are aware that the number may increase and as it does, the vendors will take them along.” The representative of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council, Omajo Nwachukwu, warned the parties not to compromise the process in the implementation of the regulation. She insisted that customers that are not comfortable with buying their meters with loans from the commercial banks should be allowed to purchase them directly from the Meter Assets Providers.
