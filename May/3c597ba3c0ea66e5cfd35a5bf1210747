Singer Runtown is set to release a new EP, titled ‘Tradition’. The singer who made this known on his website said the EP will be released in Friday, May 31, 2019.  This is coming four years after his debut album, ‘Ghetto University’ was released to wide acclaim. On why he is dropping an EP instead of an album, Runtown said he didn’t see any difeerence between the two. “For me there’s really no difference between an EP and an album,” he said. “Example, last year, Kanye West, Pusha T and Nas put out albums that had just seven songs. “TRADITION has six songs and it is what I truly feel like putting out at the moment. When it’s time for an album everyone will know.” ‘Tradition’ has five new songs and one released single, ‘Unleash’, which features South-East London artiste, Fekky. Runtown also revealed that a week before the project drops, he will be putting out a new single, Emotions, which is the second track on the EP.
