A 49-year-old hotel supervisor, Dotun Akingbade, on Monday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for alleged theft of N154,000 belonging to his employer. The defendant, who resides at No. 5, Olugbenga Street, Agbado-Ijaiye,Lagos, is facing a two-count-charge of stealing and breach of peace before Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.A. Adetunji. Prosecuting  Inspector (Insp.)  Matthew Akhaloude, told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in February 2018, between 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m. at Dansoky Hotel, located at No. 3, Prince Ademola Adunola Street, Ijaiye, Ojokoro, Lagos. Insp. Akhaloude said the defendant allegedly stole the sum of N154, 000 from the complainant, Prince Ademola Adunola. He said the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by selling the wines of the hotel and diverting the money into his pocket. According to him, the defendant, who had barely spent six months in the  employ of the complainant, also sold some of the hotel’s property, without the knowledge and consent of the owner. He said all attempts to recover the money from the defendant failed. Akingbade however pleaded not guilty to the two count charge preferred against him by the Police. Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Adetunji, granted him bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed , provide  evidence of two years tax payments to the Lagos State Government and should also have their addresses verified. She added that the sureties must be blood relations of the defendant. She adjourned the case until May 31.
