CITING safety, the Lagos State Ministry of Education has shut an unregistered private school in Orile-Agege, which is under high tension wire. In a statement yesterday, Office of Educational Quality Assurance (OEQA)  Director-General  Mrs. Ronke Soyombo, said  Multi-Vision School flouted safety standards and repeated warnings to relocate before its premises was sealed off. It said the enforcement was to ensure strict compliance with the guidelines for operating a school in a safe environment. “The school was shut down because of safety reason. What Lagos State is not ready to condone is for our children to be in a dangerous environment. We have gone to the school since January; we gave them warning letters to move because that was a school under high tension wire. Children cannot be left under high tension wire. We gave them enough notice, but they did not adhere to it. We told them to relocate. When we tell you to relocate, we give you time; but if you fail to do it on the expected date, we will not have any option but to come with our task force to close the school; and that is what we have done,” Soyombo said. She advised school owners who had been served closure and relocation notices to desist from removing them so as to avoid the wrath of the law.
