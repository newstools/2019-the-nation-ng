Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Mr Yinka Sanni said the slowdown in economic activities as well as socio-political environment impacted the first quarter results. According to him, the operating environment in the first quarter of the year was challenging, evidenced by the slowdown in economic activities that were impacted by the socio-political environment leading to muted client activity. These factors affected the growth pace of the overall business volumes and earnings. He noted that the group achieved a resilient performance, despite the challenging environment, expressing optimism that the group is well positioned to take advantage of economic activities as the macroeconomic position improves. “We will continue to leverage our universal financial services capability to ensure delivery on our guidance for 2019,” Sanni said.
