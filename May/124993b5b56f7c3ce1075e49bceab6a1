The Nigeria Industrial Social Trust Fund (NSITF) said 87,179 employers have been registered under the Employees’ Compensation Scheme (ECS) to affirm compliance with the ECA 2010. This is to respond to the move by the House of Representatives to enforce ECS compliance. NSITF Managing Director, Adebayo Somefun, who spoke with The Nation,  said it covers more than 6.7 million employees. He said the increase in registration has accounted for a 35 per cent increase in contribution collection. He said: “In order to boost statutory compliance by employers of labour and to shore up contributions so that a meaningful Employees’ Compensation Scheme can be provided to Nigerian workers, the present management sought the assistance of the House of Representatives. “Consequently, the House moved a motion to enforce compliance to the ECS and two public hearings have been held on the motion. As part of the response to this, a total number of 87,179 employers have been registered under the ECS to affirm their compliance with the ECA 2010. “This number covers more than 6.7 million employees. The increase in registration has thus far, accounted for a 35 per cent increase contribution collection.” He said more than 24,880 claims and compensation have been paid to beneficiaries under various contingencies in the last two years. “Employees’ compensation is our primary function and we have not failed in this regard. In the last two years since this management team took over. Twenty-four thousand, eight hundred and eighty (24,880) claims and compensation have been paid to beneficiaries under different contingencies. This is a record in the history of the Fund.
