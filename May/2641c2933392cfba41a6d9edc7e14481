Ammasco  Oil Company Plc has  signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Nigeria Automobile Technicians Association (NATA), aimed at  improving service delivery. Speaking  shortly after signing the MoU in Kano, its Executive Chairman, Alhaji Mustapha Mohammed Ado, said the firm has gained  recognition globally, with its products, which can favourably compete with others from Russia, Europe and Japan. According to him, the company has consistently been coming  up with innovative products, by launching seven new  improved products into the market. Already, the quality of the products has been recognised by the American Petroleum Institute (API), which had certified AMMASCO products. He said the priority of the company is to come up with new innovations, geared towards contributing  its quota to the economic development of the country. According to him, without the commitment and determination of notable industrialists in the country, the aim of growing the lubricant industry would be totally defeated.
