Super Eagles’ defender Kenneth Omeruo has put aside transfer speculations regarding his permanent switch to Leganes, revealing that only Chelsea can decide if he stays or not, AOIFootball.com reports. The 25-year-old player has been an integral part of the Leganes team this season but with his loan spell set to expire next month, the defender now hopes for a quick resolution ahead of the summer transfer window. “My stay back at Leganes will be determined after the season. I can’t really say much about the transfer, rather I am just concentrating on helping my team finish in the top 10 at the end of the season. My parent club Chelsea has the right to discuss my transfer with any other club, but for now, I am with Leganes and I am just focused on ending the season on a high with the team,” Omeruo said. Having started in 24 of the 25 league games he has featured this season, the vastly travelled defender said it has been an impressive debut season for him in Spain and hopes to do more for the fans who have shown him love since his arrival last summer. Omeruo was the star player for Leganes in their matchday 33 clash against Celta Vigo, which earned him a place in the Team of the Week and will hope to replicate the same feat when his side travels to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan to take on Sevilla later on Friday night.
