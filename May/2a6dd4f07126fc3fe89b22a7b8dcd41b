The police in Rivers State said yesterday that they have killed a notorious criminal, ThankGod Nwandiko (aka Commander Buky). Commissioner Musa Belel disclosed this in Port Harcourt while parading suspected criminals recently arrested in the state. He said the victim, who was arrested in his Omarelu community of Ikwerre Local Government, following a tip-off, was, however, killed when he attempted to escape while taking the police to arrest his gang members at Isiokpo community, also in the same local government. The police boss described Nwandiko as a notorious kidnapper, armed robber, murderer and a cultist, who was responsible for the killings and beheading of members of rival cults, as well as attacks on motorists on the Omerelu/Owerri road axis. The police paraded a bank driver, Chris Kani, who allegedly supplied information to armed robbers and kidnappers about customers and key bank officials for ransom and handsome rewards. He confessed that he had planned to kidnap his manager and head of marketing of his bank, but changed his mind by lying to his accomplices that the manager had travelled overseas. Addressing reporters, the CP said: “Operatives of the Eagle Crack Squad, acting on credible information, smashed a gang of arms dealer and arrested Israel Amadi, 41, and Michael Okunna, 35. “They were arrested on May 16 on Elele Alimini Barrack road in Emohua Local Government. Eight hundred and eighty-nine live cartridges concealed in a big sack bag, driven in a tricycle, were recovered. “Also the crack team of the police command, led by Jovinus Iwu, a Superintendent of Police (SP), paraded a gang of suspected kidnappers/armed robbers aged between 19 and 31. They were arrested in different parts of the state. The weapons recovered from them include three AK-47 rifles, 29 rounds of ammunition, six magazines, assault rifle, locally made guns, four cars, military shoes and uniforms, among others.
