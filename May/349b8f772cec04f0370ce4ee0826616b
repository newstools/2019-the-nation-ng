As the 8th Assembly rounds up, over 20 casual staff engaged by the Niger state House of Assembly in the last four years have been sent packing. The Speaker of the House of Assembly, Honorable Ahmed Marafa who disclosed this to The Nation said that he has directed that all casual staff should be laid off. He said that when the 9th Assembly comes on board, they will decide who to accept as casual staff. “I have directed that all casual staff should be laid off. As far as the leadership of the 8th Assembly is going, their tenure stands closed. “I have said that every casual staff should be given a letter appreciating them for their service in the last four years and wish them a better opportunity elsewhere.” The Speaker then lamented that the Assembly in the past three months has been given 70 per cent overhead which had made the running of the Assembly difficult as most of the departments now run on 70 per cent budget as opposed to full operation. “The overhead of the Assembly has been cut to 70 per cent in the past three months. All departments are now being given 70 per cent to run their affairs.”
