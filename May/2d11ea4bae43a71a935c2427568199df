JOEL: I am a former employee of a Federal Government agency. I want to know if it is possible to change my PFA. I have been out of employment since 2013. I have over N2million as my contributory pension. I want to change my PFA because I am not satisfied with my PFA. Is it possible for me to change my PFA? Thanks. PENCOM: Section 13 of the PRA 2014 allows an RSA holder to change his/her PFA not more than once in a year without giving any reason. The commission is about opening a transfer window to enable contributors’ move from one PFA to another. ONYAKA: Does First Pension Limited still exist as Pension Fund Manager? PENCOM: Yes. They are known as First Guarantee Pension Limited.  Their contact details are as follows: Irorun Plaza, No. 65, Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos, http://www.firstguaranteepension.com TAYO: What are the modalities for payment to those who joined the civil service in 2003 going by the Pension Act? PENCOM: Any employee who is entitled to retirement benefits under any pension scheme before June 25, 2004, being the commencement of the Pension Reform Act, 2004 falls under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). You may liaise with your PFA who would advise you on the modes of payment when you retire. DSP IZUAGIE: My name is DSP Izuagie. I retired after 35 years from the Nigeria Police. The gratuity was paid on November 30, 2017, but it was less than N1.5milion.  I was told that my contribution was not made available to PenCom for trading. Please help me. PENCOM: The relevant Department would require the PIN of the complainant in order to assist him. ASP. SAMUEL: I have written to the director of NPF Pension. They paid me N4,706, 067: 69, out of which I am paid 25 per cent of N1, 176,516:92. plus my one year arrear of N366, 701: 18. If one-year arrear can give me that, multiply it by four years and it will be N1.466, 804: 72, which is more than the N1, 176, 516: 92 that I was paid for serving for 35 years. My personal savings is more than N1.5 million. What has the government given me? My counterparts are paid than me. I am so disturbed. My other colleagues who experience the same fainted on the spot. Even a court clerk and messengers at state level can’t go home with N1 million? One of my course mates who is a traffic warden, ASP Monday has N7 million and he was paid over N3 million. PENCOM: The relevant department would require the PIN of the complainant in order to assist him. LICY: My name is Abdullahi Mohammed and my PFA is Trustfund Pension. I retired since 2014.

I am seriously in need of money to pay my children school fees. Please I need your help. Thanks. PENCOM: Please supply the PIN of the complainant to enable us assist him.
