The Police in Ogun State have arrested for suspected cultists for alleged murder of a 26-year-old man identified as Saibu Azeez on Friday. The suspects, Opeyemi Olalekan, Azeez Ologundudu, Emanuel Omoboriowo and Anigilaje Babatunde were said to have stormed a birthday party at 34, Oyedele Close, Abule Lemode, Ijoko around 2am, where they stabbed the deceased on his stomach and also stabbed another man on the head. It was gathered that the party was organised by Oluwatoye Ogun at his father’s house and the suspects in a bid to get Azeez, stabbed Ogun’s father on the head. With broken bottles, the cultists were said to have unleashed terror on other attendees at the party just to get Azeez, suspected to be a rival cult member. Those who sustained injuries were said to have been rushed to the hospital for treatment but Azeez died in the process. Confirming the incident, spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) said policemen from Agbado led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Aloko Amodu responded to a distress call from the party venue. He said preliminary investigation revealed Azeez was a suspected member of a rival cult and those who attacked him were on a likely reprisal mission. “The arrested suspects have all confessed to be members of a rival cult group. The corpse of the deceased has been deposited in the morgue for autopsy. “The Commissioner of Police Bashir Makama has ordered the transfer of the suspects to homicide section for discreet investigation. He reiterates his earlier stance against cultism in the state and vowed not to rest until the vice is completely stamped out,” said Oyeyemi.
