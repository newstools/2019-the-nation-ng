The Lagos State Government on Thursday denounced purported claims by some highly placed politicians, owners and drivers of articulated vehicles that the State has permitted them to park under the Marine Bridge, Ijora and other adjoining areas in Apapa. In a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Mr Tunji Bello, the State said it has not created any temporary park under the Marine Bridge, anywhere in Apapa and Ijora to accomodate articulated trucks, saying any truck found in the prohibited areas forthwith should be towed away. He stated that the State is fully in support of the directives of Mr President to clear all the trucks illegally parked in Apapa and will do everything possible to ensure its effectiveness. “The State Government has not given any approval or permit to any politician, individuals, owners, no matter how highly placed or corporate bodies to park articulated vehicles under the Marine Bridge, Ijora, other bridges or the major roads and setbacks in Apapa”, he maintained. He added that the State Government has given the go-ahead to all security agencies to be deployed for the clearing exercise not to spare any illegally parked trucks in Apapa or its environs immediately the exercise commences. Bello reiterated the commitment of the State Government to ensure the re-beautification and landscaping of all the setbacks and parks presently illegally occupied by the trucks. He recalled that six years ago, the setbacks under the Marine Bridge were beautified by the State Government but were degraded by the activities of truck drivers and owners who have defied all appeals. He assured residents of the State and Apapa in particular that the inconveniences presently being experienced as a result of the unwholesome activities of the trucks will soon come to a permanent end.
