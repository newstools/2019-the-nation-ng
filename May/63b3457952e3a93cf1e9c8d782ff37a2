Ohanaeze Ndigbo has disagreed with the presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, that Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere and Miyetti Allah were on the same level. A statement by the Deputy Publicity Secretary, Chuks Ibegbu, expressed shock at the comparison. It noted that Afenifere and Ohanaeze can only be compared to Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), which is the Umbrella group in the North. The statement reads: “Garba Shehu committed a grave sin by such comparison between Peace and Pieces. Ohanaeze and Afenifere represent Peace and Miyetti Allah pieces. It is like comparing the Vatican to Afghanistan. How can a group which encourages killers and terrorists be compared with Ohanaeze Ndigbo or Afenifere?” Ibegbu insisted that Shehu must apologise to Ohanaeze and Afenifere for such verbal mismanagement. He also advised that if herdsmen are to be given N100 billion, IPOB, MASSOB, area boys, Niger Delta militants, Bakassi militants, Book Haram, Shi’tes and hoodlums in Nigeria should also be paid to fight insecurity. The secretary advised the election petition tribunals to live above board and not compromise judgments. “On no account should election riggers be allowed to occupy public offices, so the tribunals must protect Nigerians by ensuring election riggers lose at the tribunals.”
