The police yesterday arraigned Mercy Sampson and Stella Madueke at an Ebute Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl from a church. Sampson, 53, and Madueke, are charged with conspiracy, forgery, false pretence, kidnapping and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Chinalu Uwadione said the defendants committed the offence last month at Igando, a Lagos suburb. He alleged that the defendants conspired to steal a three-year-old on the premises of Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministries on March 3. Uwadione said the child had since been united with her parents. He told the court that the defendants defrauded Mr. Magnus Nwaigbo of N650,000 on the pretext that they would help him adopt a child legally from the Holy Infant Orphanage. The prosecutor alleged that the defendants forged a letter on the letterhead of the orphanage and presented it to Nwaigbo in a bid to defraud him and present a stolen child to him. After the charge was read to them, they pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Mrs. Adeola Adedayo granted the defendants N1 million bail each with two sureties each in the like sum. She adjourned till July 8.
