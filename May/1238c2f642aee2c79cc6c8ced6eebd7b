THE Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) has described as illegal the tricycle group belonging to the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association Nigeria (RTEAN). The Acting Chairman of the Lagos State branch, Chief Comrade Tunji Oyeniyi, in a statement, said the new group called tricycle sector of NURTW had since been prohibited from operating by virtue of Section 2 and 45 of the Trade Union Act. Oyeniyi insisted that only TOAN is the “statutory or lawfully registered and officially recognised body to organise tricycle owners and operators as a trade union”. He noted that the TOAN  and the break-away faction could not be called a trade union as other associations of tricycle owners and operators are legally registered. He explained that the acting chairman recalled the judgment delivered by Justice B. B. Kanyip of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) on May 10, 2017, where is stated that it is the registrar of trade unions that can register a trade union, direct or recognise the affiliation of a body to a trade union subject to the overriding review powers of the court. Meanwhile,  the President, Centre for Change President, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, has urged the security agencies particularly the police, to serve as peace makers in the feud between the unions, and hence should desist from harassing the members and leadership of TOAN. In her solidarity message, she said it is against morality and convention, “to force a group of people to adopt a particular identity against their will, as members of TOAN are being made to do”.
