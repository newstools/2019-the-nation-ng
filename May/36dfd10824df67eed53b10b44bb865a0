Head coach of Lagos Seasiders’ Men and Women teams, Bukola Duru has assured that her teams are set to challenge for top prize at this year’s edition of the Prudent Energy Handball League. The men and women team finished second and fifth respectively last year, but Coach Duru has said the focus is to contest for the top prize. She stated that 30 players (16 male and 14 female) as against 36 would represent the state at the phase of the league in Abuja. She stated that the coaching crew would have love to have the full complement of their teams, but the inability to secure funds at this time informed the decision to reduce the number of players. She, however, promised her teams would contest for the top prize. “Fund is a big problem right now but we are sure the Lagos State Sports Council (LSSC) will reach out to us as the league progresses. Our desire is to do the state proud this year and by God’s Grace, we will achieve our aim.” According to her, most of the players in the men team were part of the Nigerian team to the All Africa Games qualifiers in Burkina Faso and the IHF competition in Kosovo have garnered more experience and would bring it to beat in the Prudent Energy Handball League. She also revealed that Chukwuka Michael, one of the state’s under 18 players have joined the men’s team, while Ayodele Blessing has joined the women’s team from Civil Defenders. However, the League will begin today as most of the team had not arrived Abuja on Sunday.
