THERE was confusion in Akure, the Ondo State capital, yesterday as students across tertiary institutions marched on the streets to demand reduction of their school fees. The students, mostly from the Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko (AAUA) and Ondo State University of Science and Technology(OSUSTECH) Okitipupa, protested on the popular Oba Adesida road in Akure, the state capital. The two institutions had been shut since April, following protests on campus by the students. Commercial and vehicular movements were affected during the protest. The aggrieved students carried different placards with inscriptions such as: “No reduction, no resumption”; “Akeredolu reduce or resign”; “Education must be free” and “Say no to N250,000”. Speaking with reporters during the protest, the AAUA students’ union president, Samuel Adesomoju, said the protest would continue until Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu reduces the fees. Adesomoju maintained that the current fees of N250,000, which was increased last year, has not brought any infrastructural growth to the institution. Also speaking, a former NANS JCC Chairman, Kowe Odunayo, berated the governor for the increased in school fees, adding that they would resist all means by the government to commercialise education. Addressing the protesting students in his palace, the Deji of Akure, Oba Ogunlade Aladetoyinbo, hailed them for conducting themselves in a peaceful manner. He said education was their right and must be made affordable to everyone in the society, no matter the country’s financial situation. The monarch, who spoke through his Chief of Staff, Prince Toyin Aladetoyinbo, assured the students that he would take their grievances to the governor towards reducing the school fees.
