The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested 10 persons for alleged cybercrime, popularly called `Yahoo, Yahoo’, at  Ojodu Berger, Lagos. The state NSCDC Commandant, Mr. Tajudeen Balogun, told reporters yesterday that they were arrested following a tip-off. He alleged that the gang leader  was a 100-level Accounting student of a private university in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Balogun said the suspects were between the ages of 19 and 29. He alleged that one Toyota Camry saloon car with number-plate EPE406FN, nine laptops, 16 phones, two debit cards and an Airtel modem were recovered from them. Also recovered from them were one piece of Orange Wi-Fi, 11 laptop chargers, two extension boxes, and substances suspected to be Indian hemp and charms. Balogun said: “On May 22, the state command got a piece of information about a case of abduction, assault and cybercrime. “This was as a result of a tip-off by a victim, Demini Emmanuel. “The victim claimed he was abducted, assaulted and forced to engage in cybercrime by the suspects since January 2019. “The command swung into action and arrested 10 suspects at 14b, Animashaun Street, inside Progressive Estate, Ojodu Berger, Lagos’’. He said the suspects would be  prosecuted. Balogun advised parents, landlords and the public to  report suspicious activities in their areas to the Corps and other security agencies. The 22-year-old gang leader, said he had been in the business for more than a year, stressing that he made more than N3million between January and April. He said the other suspects were found in his house because they were learning the `job’ from him. The suspect said he did not kidnap them as alleged by the NSCDC officials.
