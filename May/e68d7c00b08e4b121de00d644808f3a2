AFTER a stellar 2018, the Nigerian superstar artist has since performed alongside Burna Boy at Coachella 2019. Another highlight of the past 12 months for the singer is the project emPawa Africa.According Eazi, emPawa Africa is a “service provider” that should not be conflated with his label, Banku Music. But in the short time since its creation, emPawa has started a campaign to give $5,000 to 10 individuals/groups. On its YouTube page, the project has put up music more than seven acts across Africa. Now, the singer has said he will officially launch other arms of the service provider on July 19, 2019. He made his proclamation on his Twitter account @MrEazi. He wrote, ”I said it, and I am doing it! Empawa Distribution, Empawa Publishing, Empawa Label Services all Launch JULY 19!!!! Jah be Praised.” The platforms will include a distribution arm, a publishing arm and a label services arm.
