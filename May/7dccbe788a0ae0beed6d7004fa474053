She disclosed this on her Instagram page on Sunday. According to the mulatto, among her bad habits include throwing things from moving vehicles, picking things from a rack in a shop and returning it to another rack and smelling everything. “What bad habits do you have?” She asked. “I actually have a couple of them but just to mention a few- “1: I like to throw things through the window- especially from a moving car or from upstairs. It’s sooo disgusting I know but it gives me so much joy. “2: When I go shopping- I’m that girl that would pick something from a rack & if I change my mind I would just hang it on another rack. My uncle Charles could keeeeel me for that but whatever man. “3: I smell Everything & I mean EVERYTHING- Just let your imagination run. Okay enough of mine, do share some of yours.” Her posts got other fans sharing their bad habits, some which included farting in public, licking wound scabs, not washing hands after eating and blowing noses in buses.
