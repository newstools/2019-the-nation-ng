The Edo State owned College of Education, Ekiadolor In Ovia North East local government area that was closed in 2015 would be reopened for academic activities this September. New students to be admitted would however not resume at the Ekiadolor campus but at Abudu, headquarters of Orhionmwon local government area. It was gathered that the beginning of academic activities at Abudu would enable the formal take-off of the Tayo Akpata University of Education. The Abudu campus is located at the defunct Provincial Teachers Training College that later transformed to the orientation camp for National Youth Service Corps scheme. A visit to the Abudu campus showed that work has reached an advanced stage in the different departments, hostels and staff quarters. An equipped computer lab powered with solar energy has been completed. Governor Godwin Obaseki had last year said the state would now have one College of Education and three schools instead of having three different colleges. According to him, “Each school is specializing on specific aspect of teacher education. The one in Abudu will have a digital training centre to train primary school teachers, the school in igueben will focus on Secondary school and science teachers while the one in Auchi will specialise in training teachers in Technical Education, Physical Education and Special Education.” Commissioner for Education, Emmanuel Agbale, said the restructuring of the College of Education was a gradual process and that plans were on to open the Abudu campus in September. He explained that the Tayo Akpata University of Education could not take off if the College of Education does not leave Ekiadolor campus.
