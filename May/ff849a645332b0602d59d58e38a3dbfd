 The saying that when the desirable becomes unavailable, the available becomes desirable came to the fore Friday, as a determined Liverpool fan shunned expensive air fare to rather buy a tokunbo car to travel to Madrid for the Champions league final. The Reds face Tottenham at Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday night, bidding to win Europe’s premier competition for a sixth time. Simon Wilson, a YouTuber known for sneaking into big events such as Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor, decided to buy a ridiculously cheap car rather than take one of the costly flights out to Madrid. Rather than go in search of £800 (about N364, 612) for flight ticket Wilson settled for a £40 (about N19, 000) Skoda car to make the journey. ‘I was lucky enough to get a ticket in the ballot through my season ticket, but because the ballot wasn’t announced until recently, I didn’t want to book transport,’ he told the Liverpool Echo. ‘When I looked online, the transport was so expensive (that) it was ridiculous, the flights were around £800.’ ‘I rang up my brother, Ben, and asked him how much was the cheapest car we could get.’ After a bit of research, the pair came across a Skoda Favorit GLXI for sale on Facebook for £40, one of only six still licensed to drive in the UK. The brothers are now making the 22-hour-long drive together with a friend, documenting the journey on Simon’s YouTube channel. However, there are concerns over whether the car will make it, given it has already lost the pipe that cools the engine. Wilson insists they will reach Madrid no matter what: ‘Worst case scenario we will jump on the train make it happen – there’s no way I won’t be there.’ If you say his decision reminds of the lyrics by Bob Marley ‘When there is a will there is always a way” you will definitely be right, and I tell you many have wished them safe journey and good luck!
