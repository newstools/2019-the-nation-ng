IT is barely two weeks to the end of the current political dispensation and the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s second term, but no one seems to have a scintilla of idea on the nature or form of the new cabinet. President Buhari has kept his card so much to his chest that even the members of his kitchen cabinet do not know their fate in the coming dispensation. Forget about what you read in the papers and other news media that some members of the cabinet are assured of returning. The President is looking to dissolve his cabinet on May 22, hence it promises to be two weeks of intense pressure and uncertainties, as no one knows whether he will maintain the current structure of 36-member cabinet or adopt the 42-member format as has been touted in some quarters. Intense lobbying, however, continues as some failed candidates in the last elections, outgoing governors, popular and unpopular; ministers, performing and under-performing; are all gripped by fear while the President keeps everyone guessing.
