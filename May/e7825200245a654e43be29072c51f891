Senate Deputy Chief Whip Francis Alimikhena, yesterday urged Nigerians to expect more dividends of democracy from President Muhammadu Buhari. The Edo North Senator said that President Buhari has shown steadfastness with his promise that he was “indeed for nobody, but for everybody by giving voice to the collective aspirations and yearnings of Nigerians.” Alimikhena added that the President has demonstrated “statesmanship, trust and dedication to the service of humanity.” “We may not have gotten to where we want to be, but we are also not in the same place where we used to be as a nation.” Alimikhena, who is also a contender for the Deputy Senate President in the ninth Senate, in his congratulatory message, commended President Buhari for his humility in victory. He said: “President Buhari has served his pact with Nigerians and it behooves on Nigerians to stand together in adversity and overcome the threat to our national development.” He appealed to those fanning embers of crisis at various quarters to embrace peace for the purpose of our common destiny. Alimikhena said: “Destiny has placed a burden on us as Nigerians to work together for peace and unity of our country. Irrespective of our religion and political divide, we must rise to the occasion and salvage our country from retrogression collectively and individually” “Nigeria belong to Nigerians and not any individual. It is wrong to subject the nation to an unusual unrest to satisfy individual ambition. We must together forge a common front for the peace, progress and stability of our nation. “Meaningful democracy cannot be achieved without opposition but we must also be challenged with the fact that there is no government better than that in which everybody is involved irrespective of party platforms. Good governance is the elimination of premodial interest by upholding public interest above party affiliations.
