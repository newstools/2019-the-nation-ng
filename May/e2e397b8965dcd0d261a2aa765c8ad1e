The Supreme Court has upheld the election of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State. In a unanimous judgment on Friday, a five-man panel of the court dismissed the appeal filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the last governorship election in Ekiti, Kolapo Olusola Eleka. In the lead judgment by Justice John Okoro, the court held that the appeal was unmeritorious and proceeded to uphold an earlier judgment by the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which affirmed the decision of the election tribunal, to the effect that Fayemi was validly elected.
