The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has read the riot act to manufacturers in Abia State on sub-standard manufacturing practices. Its coordinator in the state, Mr. Lad-Alabi Oluyomi, who gave the warning in Aba during the week, said the organisation would apply the law if manufacturers refused to follow the standard practices. He said the greatest challenge facing the organisation in the state was operator-inspired as a lot of manufacturers are deceitful. “That is why there are lots of unwholesome products in the market now. If you look at it from two angles, for most products, they are either being counterfeited or produced substandard, which are actually things we are trying to fight. “We have the enabling laws now to really help us, and that is why I have been speaking to the manufacturers on it. I need the manufacturers to help me so that we can all do much more together for their businesses, and help them to be completely out of deceit and avoid being prosecuted by SON,” Oluyomi said. He described the challenge facing the organisation in the state as enormous because people failed to report the dealers and producers of such fake products. “If you report to SON, we will tackle it, retrieve the bad product, and ensure that it is only the safer one that is in the society, and that will cut off the oxygen that feeds the purveyor of such bad products. “We cannot be everywhere because we have issue of personnel shortage; although, we are doing all that we can under the limitation of our work.
