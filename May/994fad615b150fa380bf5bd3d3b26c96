Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has attributed his current political travails to some national leaders of the All Progressives Party (APC), who he said he opposed. Okorcha accused some chieftains of the party and “other political adversaries” of instigating the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and related agencies against him and members of his family. The governor accused the political adversaries for preventing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from issuing him a Certificate of Return after he was declared the winner of this year’s election in Imo West Senatorial District. He raised the allegations in two fundamental rights suit he filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja. Listed as respondents in the suits are: the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Department of State Services (DSS), the EFCC, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) and the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). Of all the respondents, only the DSS, filed counter-affidavits against the suits as at Tuesday when the cases were mentioned.
