Nigeria bounced back from their opening loss to Kenya with 11runs win over Botswana at the T20 World Cup Africa holding in Kampala, Uganda. Today, the Nigerian side will be aiming for another victory when they host neighbour – Ghana in their third of the competition in its bid to find relevance in the competition. Ghana will also be hoping to record their first victory having lost to Namibia and Kenya. Nigeria was beaten by Kenya in their opening match by eight wickets but the Nigerian side find their form against Botswana yesterday with 11runs win. The opening day was abandoned due to inclement weather in Kampala, Kenya made the early noise, trouncing Nigeria by eight wickets in the opening game. Kenyan captain, Shem Ngoche took two for 6 in three overs, as the West Africans were restricted to 105 for five in their overs. Only veteran Leke Odeye made an impression, with a run-a-ball 27 for Nigeria. The response from Kenya was brutal; 106 for two from just 12.2 overs. Alex Obanda got the innings going with 27 from 22 balls, but it was Dhiren Gondaria’s punishing 47 not out, from just 31 balls, that settled the match. Namibia also made a bright start, as they cruised to a nine-wicket triumph over Ghana. Zhivago Groenewald’s three for 20 was key, with only Simon Ateak’s 26 providing a foundation for the Black Stars. 91 for seven always looked below par, and Namibia made short work of it. Stephan Baard clubbed 52 from 34 balls, leading from the front, while Nikolaas Davin’s 38 was a handy foil. In the third game of the day, hosts Uganda showed their mettle with a 52-run victory over Botswana. It was the perfect start to the tournament, with contributions all round. Arnold Otwani (44) and Hamu Kayondo (30) lifted the hosts to 142 for seven, despite the experienced Karabo Modise snaring three for 18. The tournament serves as T20 World Cup Qualifier holding later this year, with the final destination being the T20 World Cup proper, in November 2020.
