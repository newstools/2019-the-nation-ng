Management of the University of Ibadan (UI) has given the rationale behind the introduction of a ‘technology levy’ of N6,500 beginning from the 2018/2019 academic session. The levy, according to the management, is to provide students with internet services. Incidentally, the new fee is a follow up to the accommodation fee which last session was increased to N10,000 per head, and provoking mild outbursts from students. The vice chancellor, Prof Olayinka Idowu, explained that the technology levy was for improved internet services for students. “We are committed to providing fast, reliable and robust internet services to students,” said Prof Olayinka in a chat with CAMPUSLIFE. He continued: “The university is opening up internet access to students on campus; and as such there is an ongoing investment on additional network infrastructure/ bandwidth. “The bandwidth is projected to be increased in the first instance from the present 475 to 775 mbps. It is worth mentioning that the bandwidth increase will be dedicated to the new student network. “The bandwidth cost will grow from N64million to about N100million. This is excluding other required network infrastructural upgrade. I do hope this clarification helps in providing justification for the technology fee”. However, some of the aggrieved students are venting their anger on the social media to kick against management’s action. One of the students identified simply as Samuel wrote on whatsapp: “Last year, it was the hike in accommodation fee; this year it’s technology fee. My monthly allowance is N6500 ooooo.” Another student, Oladeji Abiodun mocked the management on twitter: “…the (N6500) must be for maintenance of ‘faculty of technology’ in the school so that we can produce best engineers and prevent plane crash in the country.”
