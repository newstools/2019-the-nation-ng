COMEDIENNE Anita Asuoha, known as Realwarripikin, will be a guest speaker at the Benson Idahosa University,  on May 9, 2019,  to talk about self-discovery at an event tagged ‘From Campus to Career’. The event will hold at the post-graduate auditorium on the campus. The comedienne who is a graduate of Political Science and Public Administration of the university rose to limelight after revealing how surviving depression and suicide pushed her into making motivational and funny skits on social media. It birthed the Realwarripikin brand. “It’s indeed a privilege to be part of this,” said Anita, who currently works with the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC. “A speaker in the university I graduated from. Back to base. We are getting warmed up! Alumni-student engagement.” Anita, a former Glo ambassador, is also an actor, brand influencer, and award-winning dancer (Maltina Dance All Season4 and Glo Rockn Rule). Anita was honoured in the Leading Ladies Africa/Ynaija’s annual award ceremonies as one of the ‘100 Most Inspiring Women in Nigeria’ in March 2019. She also won the award for the Next Rated Comedian of the Year at the Nigerian Achievers Award held in April 2019.
