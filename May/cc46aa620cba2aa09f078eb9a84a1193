Former Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi  Ambode has said his administration’s investments in the education sector were already paying off with many public school pupils excelling in competitions and public examinations, the latest of which was the exploit by Ekene Franklin Ezeunala an SS3 pupil of Meiran Community Senior High School, who scored the highest mark of 347 in the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) nationwide. In his speech at the Children’s Day parade held at the Agege Stadium on Monday, Ambode, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the office of the Deputy Governor, Mrs Yetunde Odejayi, Ambode said: “As the tenure of this administration comes to an end, I am pleased to note to the glory of God that our investment in the education sector has been yielding the desired dividend as our students have been displaying excellence in various competitions.  Just recently, a Lagos State student, Master Franklin Ekene with 347 marks emerged with the best result in Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). “A total of five schools will represent Lagos State at the 2019 National Stockholm Junior Water Prize competition finals.  The schools’ projects were selected by the organizing team who picked five projects from Lagos State as against one project expected from each state. “These are a few of the recent achievements which indicates that our level of education is not only high but of international standard.  Most importantly, as a result of our efforts in the education sector, we have to a large extent restored the confidence of our people in the public school system at all levels.” Also speaking, wife of the Lagos State Governor, Mrs Bolanle Ambode, who was represented by Mrs Kemi Durosinmi Etti, urged families to inculcate values and invest in their children which in turn would reduce their involvement in juvenile crimes. The programme featured a match past by uniformed clubs operating in schools across the state, public and private primary and secondary schools, cutting of a cake designed as books and a basket of fruits, and the flag-off of registration of pupils of school age into primary one classes in public primary schools.
