President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday night urged Nigerians to expose criminals in their Neighbourhood. This, he said, is the trait people knew Nigerians for. By exposing those bad elements in our communities, Buhari said will aid foreign investments in the country. “We’ll do our best to equip the security agencies to curb the security lapses in the country,” he said. He warned the heads of the security agencies to sit up or be shown the way out.
