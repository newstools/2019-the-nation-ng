Nigeria’s fastest runner this year, Divine Oduduru continues his fine form this year after booking his place in the finals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) outdoor championships are June 5-8 at Mike A. Myers Stadium in Austin. Oduduru, the fastest collegian this year in the men’s 100m and 200m, had an easy progress in both events. For clocking 10.06 in the 100m to finish second overall behind Cravon Gillespie, who recorded 10.01 and 10.03, Oduduru secured his spot in the final come June. Oduduru then placed second overall in the 200m with 20.08 behind Texas Tech teammate Andrew Hudson (20.04). The duo later teamed up to win the 4x100m in 39.00, just 0.03 ahead of an Oregon squad that featured Gillespie on the second leg. A flurry of speedy sprint performances headlined both NCAA Preliminaries as US collegiate athletes attempted to book their spots at next month’s NCAA Championships by placing among the top 12 in their events. There were fast times in the shorter sprints too as Ghanaian sprinter Joseph Amoah of Coppin State topped both rounds of the 100m, clocking a PB of 10.10 (1.2m/s). He was closely followed by Japan’s 2015 world U18 champion Hakim Sani Brown, who recorded 10.13 (0.7m/s)
