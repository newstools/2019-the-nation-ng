A new movie, ‘Clustered Colours’ by notable actress Memuna Abaji Yahaya, opened in major cinemas across the country yesterday. Memuna hinted that the movie will show at all Silverbird Cinemas across the country and at major cinemas in different parts of  the country including Maturion Cinema, Igando, Lagos, Ozone Cinema Yaba, Espionage Cinemas, Kaduna and at Mcrystal Cinema in Oyo, Auchi and Osun. “The story is centered around a television presenter and an event convener who organised a quiz on her talk show that x-rays challenges in marriages called bond,” she said. “Three lucky couples emerged as winners. These families who were chosen represented the Igbo, Yoruba and the Hausa tribes  of Nigeria. The reward was an all-expense paid trip to a resort tucked away in Epe – Jubilee Chalets. Away from distractions, they couples have more time to bond, foster intimacy and work out their differences.” Directed by Remi Ibinola, the movie stars Deyemi Okanlanwon, Paul Adams, Tunbosun Aiyedehin, Mary Lazarus, Emeka Okoye, Lucy Ameh, Stan Nze.  Memuna also doubles as an actor in the movie. At a recent premiere, the film earned commendations for Memuna who has starred in several television series and movie productions including ‘Hills and Valley’, ‘Living in Lagos’, ‘Spider’, ‘Shadows’, ‘Heartbeat’, ‘Plumber’ and other hit films.
