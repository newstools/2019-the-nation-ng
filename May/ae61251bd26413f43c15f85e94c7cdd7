Considering the quality of Nigeria’s Super Eagles, the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) is seeking a friendly against the Coach Genor Rohr side as part of Taifa Stars’ build-up to the 2019 AFCON holding in Egypt next month. According to TFF Technical Director, Ammy Ninje said yesterday that the federation had made a request to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for this proposal. Aside from Nigeria, Tanzania is also willing to tackle Ghana and Burundi as part of their preparation for the tournament in Egypt. Having been drawn in Group C alongside Kenya, Algeria and Senegal, Ninje said their intention was to play as many friendlies as possible before their first group match against Senegal on June 23 in Cairo. Already, they had scheduled a friendly against Egypt on June 13 in Cairo and Ninje believes this would help the team to cause surprise in Egypt. Their last appearance at AFCON was in 1980 in Lagos and the TFF Technical Director said: “Only one match has been confirmed which is against Egypt. However, we are still waiting for a response from Nigeria, Ghana and Burundi. We have so many technical plans aiming to make some of the team players to get international exposure.” Taifa Stars are expected to resume camping early next month after head coach, Emmanuel Amuneke named a 39-man provisional squad for AFCON.
