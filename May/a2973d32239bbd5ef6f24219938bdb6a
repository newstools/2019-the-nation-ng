THE Oyo State All Progressives Congress (APC) has faulted speculations in the media that it was nominating the next ministerial candidate for the new cabinet expected to be put in place by President Muhammadu Buhari after his second term inauguration on May 29. There have been sustained rumours of alleged backing of a particular individual by the leadership of the party in Oyo State for the ministerial slot against the interest of other contenders. In a statement signed yesterday by the APC Chairman, Chief Akin Oke, the party said the President has not contacted it for nomination of candidates for the ministerial slot. The party regretted that a national newspaper (not The Nation) could throw caution into the wind, when it published a story of a fake nomination, which it could not even substantiate. “To set the record straight, there was never a time Mr. President or any of his aides contacted us for ministerial nomination and as such, we could not have made any effort to suggest or nominate anyone to represent the state in the new cabinet. Moreso, such nomination and appointment is the prerogative of Mr. President and the law of the land is clear on this. “As much as we crave for the appointment of a competent hand from our dear state, who would add value to the cause of a better nation and contribute his quota to the revitalisation of Oyo APC, we have no reason to influence President Buhari’s choice of nominee.
