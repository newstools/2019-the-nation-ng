The Rehabilitation and Rescue Department of the Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development yesterday rescued triplets, who were being used for begging by their mother. The Head, Public Affairs, Mrs. F. A. Olabisi, said in a statement yesterday that a soldier, who pleaded anonymity, apprehended Uchechi Chi, the mother of the triplets, for allegedly using her children to beg for alms around Ikeja GRA. The statement further said: “The soldier took the mother and her children to Bond FM radio station on Adekunle Fajuyi Way, GRA, Ikeja, where they were rescued by the officials of the Rehabilitation and Rescue Department. “The mother was reported to have fled from Obosi in Anambra State to Lagos on Sunday evening for fear of being killed by suspected cultists. “Narrating her ordeal, Uchechi said she gave birth to the triplets on April 10 after dropping out of St. Monica College in Anambra State in SS3 and worked as a cook at a restaurant in Obosi after her parents’ death. “According to her, she fled Obosi on Saturday night and arrived Lagos on Sunday for fear of being killed by suspected cultists with her children. “She alleged that the father of the triplets belongs to a cult and abandoned her and the triplets due to ongoing clashes among rival cults.” Reacting to the operation, Youth and Social Development Commissioner Agboola Dabiri said the rescue was an attestation that the government was against any form of abuse on children as well as street begging. Agboola, who expressed displeasure at the fate of the children, directed officials of the ministry to take them into custody at the government’s rehabilitation home, while investigation continues. Chi and her triplets have been taken to a general hospital for treatment.
