Members of the Christian Welfare Initiative (CWI) in Lagos have expressed unhappiness over banditry, kidnapping and extra-judicial killings in Nigeria. They spoke at a media briefing last week with the theme “Insecurity, honesty, equity and welfare for Nigerians.” The CWI President, Archbishop Michael Fadeyi, said the increasing social vices in the nation had reached a point where government should give utmost priority to tackling insecurity. This, he said, is because security of lives and property remains the first duty of government. While acknowledging the security forces are overstretched, Fadeyi suggested said it was high time federal government reconsidered the issue of state policing. “The burden of policing the whole country with different complexities, cultures and terrains is clearly becoming unbearable for only the federal government to cope with,” he said. He added that evil and despair should not be allowed to consume any country, saying “innovative leadership, deployment of technology, personnel trainings, adequate funding and equipment and discipline of security forces will ensure that these vices, which has caused more than enough sorrow and bloodshed in the land will be dealt with appropriately.” Archbishop Fadeyi, who was inaugurated at the event, replaced late Archbishop Magnus Atilade, the founder of the organisation Speaking on the outcome of the 2019 elections, Fadeyi congratulated the losers for efforts in strengthening the nation’s democracy and the winners for their victory. He urged the winners “not to forget their campaign promises to the people, as they assume the positions they were elected into.” CWI is a Christian Organisation that represents the political interests of all denominations in Nigeria.
