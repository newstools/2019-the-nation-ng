Condemnations have trailed the demolition of one of the Akachi towers in Imo State, one of the monuments erected by former Governor Rochas Okorocha, barely 24 hours after the new governor, Emeka Ihedioha, assumed office. Many have condemned the action, saying the monument was built with public fund and should not be pulled down to spite the former administration. Ihedioha was sworn in as the sixth executive governor yesterday. The Akachi towers, one of the many tourist attractions built by Okorocha, was built on a reclaimed dumpsite that was abandoned by previous administrations. It was inaugurated barely a week ago by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The demolition was supervised by soldiers who barred journalists from covering the exercise. There are fears that the new governor will also demolish other monuments in Owerri, especially the famous statues. But the governor has denied ordering the demolition. Ihediohaâ€™s Special Adviser, Steve Osuji, said the governor was not aware of the demolition and never gave such directive. According to him, the governor was in the Government House trying to settle down in his office.
