THE Taraba State House of Assembly yesterday explained why it decided to have a cordial working relationship with the executive arm instead of baring it fangs and fighting it. Its Speaker, Peter Abel Dish, said the lawmakers have not left any stone unturned in their legislative role of checking the excesses of the executive arm, particularly the behaviour of the governor. But they prefer the cordial approach for “speedy development” to thrive. The Assembly, like in many other Nigerian states, is seen as a rubber stamp of the chief executives. It has often been accused of failing in its constitutional responsibility of checking the “excesses” of the governor. But, Diah noted that the several times they met with Governor Ishaku and explained things, the governor had always listened to them. Diah spoke at the Valedictory Session of the Eighth Assembly. The Speaker said: “We do this because we have Taraba at heart and we want the state to move forward “Not that we cannot bite, but states record speedy development when there is cordial relationship between its executive and legislature. “Tarabans and indeed Nigerians are unanimous in pointing out that the Darius Ishaku administration has made positive impacts in changing the landscape of the state, through infrastructure and amenities, despite lean resources. “We are happy to note that it is the quality legislation provided by this House that contributed very much to the success of the government over these four years.”
