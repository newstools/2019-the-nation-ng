Abductors of a senior Pastor of Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Dankade, in Igabi local government area of Kaduna State, Rev. Zakariah Ido and 16 members of the church have contacted the family of the Reverend, demanding N15 million ransom. Rev. Zakariah Ido, his daughter and 15 other members of the church were kidnapped during the church service last Sunday. A family source, Pastor Bala Ido who confirmed the development to The Nation in a telephone interview said, the kidnappers turned down their offer of one million Naira and banged the phone on them. According to him, “the kidnappers have called us this afternoon. They demanded N15 million, but we told them we don’t have such amount, that we can only raise one million Naira. “On hearing that, they started insulting us. They even warned us not to ever call them until the N15 million is complete. “While we were planning with them, they just banged the phone us. Now, we are even scared of calling them again, because they said if we call and the money is not complete, they will kill our people.” Pastor Bala Ido disclosed. Asked whether the matter had been reported to the Police, Pastor Ido said, “we didn’t report to the Police, and the reason is that, they won’t do anything about it. “We are acting from experience, it happened to us about two years ago, when one of our community members was kidnapped. We reported to Police and nothing was done about it, we ended up paying N1.5 million to secure his release. “Therefore, we are only praying and making efforts on our own to get them (victims) released. Even today, we held a prayer session and we believe in the power of God.” Ido explained.
