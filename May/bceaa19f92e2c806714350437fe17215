This year’s event would be an encounter with destiny,” she said. She further stated the 2019 conference would provide a bigger opportunity for women to converge and share, network and encourage each other. She urged women to grab the opportunity to be there. In 2017, the maiden edition of the conference ignited a movement of gamechangers amongst the participants while 2018 saw the women breaking through. This year, the women would be setting a motion to disrupt. The testimonies of the conference since inception have warmed the hearts of women across the continent, which has assured them of the Founder’s vision of impacting the lives of women to become role models who will break through every barrier and become what God has ordained them to be.
