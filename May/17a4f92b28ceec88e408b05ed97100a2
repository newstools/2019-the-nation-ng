President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated one of the pioneer cadets of Nigerian Defence Academy and a civil war veteran, Col Paul Osa Ogbebor, on his 80th birthday. Buhari, according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, recognised his lofty contributions to nation building. He joined family members, friends and professional colleagues in celebrating Col. Ogbebor for his strong sense of patriotism, discipline and forthrightness, expressed in his serving the country as a military officer, and subsequently sustained in community building, manifestly in promoting peace and unity in the Niger Delta. The President commended the civil war veteran for publishing his memoirs as one of the pioneer cadets of the Nigerian Defence Academy and setting up a leadership centre that equips the younger generation with entrepreneurship skills. As he turns an octogenarian, President Buhari believed Col. Ogbeborâ€™s discipline and wise counsels to leaders will continue to resonate, especially his position on a more collective fight against corruption.
