Hassan Alhameen, a.k.a. “Harmeen”, a 10-year-old rap artiste says that he always uses  his leisure  periods after school hours  to compose  music and keep away from negative peer influence. The JSS-1 student of Gold Field College, Ikotun, a Lagos suburb, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday. He said several  children had become victims of negative influence when they did not channel their energies into positive things during their leisure time. Alhammen, who started rapping at age five praised his parents for their support and guidance in nurturing his talents as well as ensuring that he remained focused in  his education. According to him, he won the Murkreminisce Competition in 2018 and  he received monetary reward for it from the popular rapper “Reminisce”. He said that he had also been signed on by   the Nigeria/UK  record label:  Efoski Entertainment. “I attribute my success to my parents who have dedicated their time to building the needed character in me to excel both in my school and my music career. “It is the home  training that has led me to where I am today. I just don’t want to be famous alone but to also be a good influence to my generation,” he said. The young rapper said that his role models in the industry had  remained Reminisce, Olamide, Davido and many others. “My mum always tells me to do my best and my dad also encourages and supports me so that one day, I will eventually become a successful musician like the my role models,” he said. Alhammen, advised his colleagues to build a hobby that would keep them busy after school hours  and prevent them from taking to vices. According to him, his other achievements include: recording four musical tracks and two videos, being nominated as the next young rated budding  artist by Wonder Kids Awards 2019.
