Super Eagles stand-in captain, Ahmed Musa claimed his 4th career league title with Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr following their 2-1 win at home to Al-Batin to end Al-Hilal two-year reign as league champions, AOIFootball.com reports. Just one point ahead of Al-Hilal going into the final game of the campaign, Musa and his teammates were backed by a record crowd at the Prince Faisal bin Fahad Stadium with Musa starting his 22nd game of the season. Moroccan forward and league top scorer Abderrazak Hamdallah put the host ahead from 12 yards halfway through the first half to send the host into an early jubilation mood. Their joy was however cut short eight minutes into the second half when Zied Ounalli equalised for the visitors for 1-1 but Abderrazak was on hand to make it 2-1 four minutes later, netting his 34th goal of the campaign to hand the host all three points. Having scored seven goals and contributing another seven assists, Musa 26, will now switch his attention to next monthâ€™s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt as he aims to win his second AFCON following the triumph in 2013 under the late Stephen Keshi.
