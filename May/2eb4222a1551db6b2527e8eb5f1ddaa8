The Chief Executive Officer,  Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), Modibbo Hamman Tukur, has commended the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for revolutionising tax administration in the country. Tukur made his view known during a courtesy visit to Mr. Tunde Fowler, FIRS Chairman, in Abuja. According to Tukur, FIRS’ contribution to the country’s revenue through tax is almost at par with oil revenue, adding that Fowler’s exploits, in addition to what he inherited, are revolutionary. The NFIU chief also promised that tax compliance will soon become a key constituent of every criminal investigation by NFIU. “The FIRS has been a partner of the NFIU. Our MoU with you underscores the importance of the relationship and how we all feel for this country. In our own record, there is no government agency that recorded so much transition and changes since the advent of this democracy like the FIRS. What happened at the FIRS is a complete revolution and it fell in line with the expectation of every democratic society where the citizens are always expected to fund the existence of the community and finance existence of the government and its own welfare and security apparatus. And that is exactly what the FIRS is doing today,” said Tukur.
