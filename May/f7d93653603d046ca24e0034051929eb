The Nigerian Stock Exchange has concluded arrangements to hold the 6th edition of its NSE Corporate Challenge in continuation of the Exchange’s efforts to support the fight against cancer in Nigeria. Instituted in 2014, the NSE Corporate Challenge is a one-d ay competitive and fun-filled five-kilometre walk, jog and run event designed to create awareness on early detection and raise funds to support the fight against cancer in Nigeria. The day’s activities will also include dance, aerobics, music and entertainment. Winners in the various race categories will be recognised at the medal presentation ceremony. The 2019 edition, scheduled for Saturday, July 6 in Lagos, will bring together participants from listed and non-listed companies, dealing member firms, government institutions and other non-commercial organisations; as well as celebrities and other notable Nigerians to support the fight against cancer. Head of Shared Services Division, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Mr. Bola Adeeko, noted that the NSE has in the past five years taken a leadership position in raising cancer awareness and increasing advocacy, leveraging its access to a vast network of employees and clients of listed companies, dealing member firms, well-meaning individuals and other stakeholders. He said maintaining a healthy lifestyle through diet and frequent exercise has been proven to be an effective approach to reduce the risk of cancer, the reason NSE has chosen sports as a vehicle to raise awareness and advocate for change.
