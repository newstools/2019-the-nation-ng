Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Chairman, Nigeria Diaspora Commission, has called on Nigerians in the Diaspora to prevail on the Ninth National Assembly (NASS) to amend the constitution to enable them vote in next elections. Dabiri-Erewa made the call on Thursday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sideline of the inauguration dinner with ‘Diasporans’ in Abuja. She said there was need for lawmakers to expedite action by amending sections of the constitution and the Electoral Act (2010 as amended). This she said would make way for Nigerians living outside the country to participate in the electoral process and vote. “It is the responsibility of all of us; it is about the national assembly to amend the section of our laws to make it possible for Nigerians in the Diaspora to vote. “This is the ninth assembly, hopefully, they will listen to the yearning of the Diaspora that they should be able to vote; smaller countries are doing it. “It can also be done in such a way that it will even add more credibility to whatever things we are doing, so it is about the National Assembly amending the law,” Dabiri-Erewa. She said that the Diasporas were ambassador wherever they are and that the commission was going to have Diaspora policy that will guide all Diaspora engagements. “We also want them to invest in Nigeria, we want their investment back in the country, we have been talking about Foreign Direct Investment but the Diaspora investment will be huge. “We need to encourage them, we need to address their challenges and we are ready to do it. “We have been saying that human resources are our greatest assets so let us tap into those resources, Nigerians at home and Nigerians abroad,” she said.
