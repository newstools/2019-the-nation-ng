Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said they expected the bullish run by MTN Nigeria to continue to impact positively on the overall market position. “In the absence of a positive catalyst, we guide investors to trade cautiously in the short term. However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals and compelling valuation remain supportive of recovery in the mid-to-long term,” Cordros Capital stated, underscoring the fragile pricing situation.
