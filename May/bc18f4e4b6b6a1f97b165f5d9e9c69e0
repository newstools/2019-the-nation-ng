The Grand Mufti, Conference of Islamic Organisations (CIO), Sheikh Dhikrullahi Shafi’i has urged Muslims to strive and explore all avenues at improving the quality of their fast to earn full reward. He said this was imperative because, majority of Muslims are often immersed in some certain acts that are capable of reducing their reward. He noted that a quality fast in Islam transcends mere abstinence from eating and drinking. The revered cleric said a good fast must be devoid of excessive talk, theft among other acts that are forbidden in Islam. He said: “There is lot more that goes into fasting to earn the full reward. A good fast is one that deeply involves our mind, eyes, tongue, legs and the entire body. “Fasting with the mind is to desist from envying other people for no reason, inferiority complex, pride, indulging in what Allah has forbidden such as drinking alcohol, engaging in adultery, fornication, gambling and betting.  We have to desist from all that Allah detests. “Fasting with the tongue means that we must watch the engagements of our tongue either in the way of eating or talking. One of the things that can earn a Muslim hell fire or paradise is the tongue. So, it is a must that we exercise caution in the way we use the tongue. “If we want our tongue to fast with us, we must not lie, backbite, spite people or engage in false accusation. We must not make jest of people and shun vain talks.” He urged fellow clerics to avoid hate speech during sermons. “What is expected of us as preachers is to create a viable atmosphere for people to grow in knowledge, morals and spiritual,” he said.
