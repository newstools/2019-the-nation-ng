The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) will hold its fifth forum from July 26-27 in Abuja. The forum is the culmination of the yearly TEF Programme, which this year mentored, trained and seeded over 3,000 young Africans, selected from over 216,000 applicants. The event provides a unique opportunity for young women and men, from 54 African countries, to meet, learn and network with the broader African and global entrepreneurship ecosystem. It is also a critical opportunity for political leaders and policy makers to meet, face to face, a new generation of African business leaders, who are transforming Africa’s economic trajectory. Keynote speakers at the highly anticipated forum include Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, and  Macky Sall, President of Senegal, who will join Tony O. Elumelu, TEF Founder and Chairman of Heirs Holdings and the United Bank for Africa (UBA) in an intimate open house discussion. The Presidential Convening is a highlight of the forum,  allowing the African entrepreneurs in attendance to engage with political leaders, to give first-hand testimony of the important role government can play in catalysing growth and encouraging business ambition. The forum agenda includes masterclasses and panel discussions with leading speakers and sector experts, from Africa and globally, who will engage attendees in specialised training sessions to share insights, deepen their knowledge and refine their skills. The forum will also feature a pitching event, where select entrepreneurs will deliver exciting presentations on the goods and services they provide to a distinguished judging panel.
