Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State has won the excellence in governance award of the Association of Senior Civil Servant of Nigeria. State chairman of the Association, Comrade Ifeanyi Okechukwu, said the award was presented to the governor for his uncommon transformation of the State. Okechukwu who noted that the award was part of the 2019 worker’s day celebration, said Obiano deserved the numerous accolades being showered on him. He said, “Organized labour in and outside the state have variously appreciated the Governor for prompt payment of workers’ salaries and pensions in a country where other states are owing months and years of backlog of salaries. “His firm promise to be the first to pay the new National minimum wage of 30,000 naira is also worth commending.” Okechukwu who doubles as the state chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC), recalled that the State had also been rated highly by the World Bank as the best performing state in the South East and South South in the implementation of World Bank projects. He noted that the security, education, agriculture and other sectors continue to do very well in the state and stressing that on many indices, Anambra State stands tall among equals. “Some of the achievements so far recorded by the association under governor Obiano administration include, payment of the three years arrears of salaries owed water corporation staff and the payment of 1.8billion Local government pension arrears. Receiving the award, governor Willie Obiano, thanked the association for the award, assuring his commitment to doing more including his promise to pay the new minimum wage.
