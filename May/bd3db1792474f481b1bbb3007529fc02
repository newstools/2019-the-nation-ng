Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Education, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye, has congratulated Master Ezeunala Ekene Franklin, an SS3 pupil of Meiran Community Secondary School, Meiran, for making the best score in the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Franklin scored 347 in the examination. A breakdown of the result showed that he had 78 in English, 91 in Mathematics, 86 in Physics and 92 in Chemistry. In a statement signed by the Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Education, Adesegun Ogundeji, Mrs Adekanye said she was not surprised at Franklin’s performance, saying he had won many laurels representing the state in competitions. She said the 15-year old came first in the Zonal final of 2018 NNPC National Quiz competition. He proceeded and represented the South West at the National finals in Abuja. Adekanye noted that Franklin was to lead the Lagos team to 2018 Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientist (JETS) competition last December but when it was rescheduled, he had to be dropped to enable him concentrate on his WASSCE. She expressed joy that a new team of SS2 pupils eventually won the competition. A feat she ascribed to the qualitative education that the State has been providing. Mrs Adekanye said quite a number of public school pupils did very well in the 2019 UTME – like Ihejeamatu Anthony of Festac Senior Grammar School who scored 327; AbdulLateef Adeyemi of Government Senior College, Ajara (295) and Tadese Fafai and AbdulWaheed Adegbite both of Abibat Mogaji Millennium Secondary School, Agege (291 and 271). The Permanent Secretary praised Franklin and others who had made Lagos and Nigeria proud locally and internationally. Adekanye said their performance would encourage the government to do more in making the school environment conducive for teaching and learning and continue organizing inter-school competitions in place such as the state quiz and debate, current affairs and the like.
