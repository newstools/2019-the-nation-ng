The wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha Buhari has criticised the $16 million spent by Nigeria as counterpart funding for the purchase of mosquito nets. She expressed reservations on the $16m counterpart fund expended on mosquito nets during an interactive session with women at the State House, Abuja on Saturday. She also said that the implementation of Social Investment Programmes (SIP) has failed in the north. “I have heard about mosquito nets, Nigeria paid its counterpart fund, $16m. I asked them to give my own share of the net to send it to my village people. I didn’t get it. “They have spent, $16m on buying mosquito nets, I did not get it, maybe some people have gotten it. But I feel that that’s my personal opinion, $16m is enough to fumigate mosquitoes in Nigeria. That’s my opinion,” she said.
