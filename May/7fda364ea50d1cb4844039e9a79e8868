An Abuja Magistrate Court sitting in Mpape on Tuesday granted Senator Ademola Adeleke a N2 million bail. Adeleke had pleaded not guilty when the charge was read to him. Magistrate Muhammed Suberu granted the Senator bail with a condition that he provides a surety, who must reside within the jurisdiction of the court. The Magistrate also granted Adeleke permission to travel abroad to attend to his health as earlier granted by a Federal High Court in Abuja and a High Court of Osun State in Ikirun. Meanwhile, the Police on Tuesday also arraigned Senator Adeleke before a Magistrate Court in Mpape, Abuja on a fresh five-count charge. Adeleke is, in the new charge, accused of forging a letter of attestation and result from Mustlim Grammar School, Ede Osun State, which he allegedly submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before he contested  the last governorship election in Osun State as the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The police already have a similar charge pending before the Federal High Court, Abuja in which he is currently being tried with four others.
