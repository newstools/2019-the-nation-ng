The management of the National Assembly is disposing off office equipment to outgoing members of the National Assembly at rock bottom prices, The Nation has gathered. Payment for the equipment such as computers, scanners, photo copying machines, television sets and refrigerators will be deducted from the severance package of the beneficiaries. Some non-returning federal legislators were seen on Friday moving such office equipment into waiting trucks and Sport Utility Vehicles. Although some of the lawmakers gave the acquired items to their aides and supporters, others chose to sell theirs to willing buyers within the National Assembly complex. Some National Assembly workers were shocked at the development, especially at what they called the ridiculously low prices the items were being given away. One of them said: “It is unfortunate because the equipment cost much more than what they are being given out for. It is no excuse that the equipment are tagged used because you can’t get them for those ridiculous prices outside. “Meanwhile, incoming lawmakers must be provided with a new set of these equipments.  What is wrong with these ones being given away that the incoming lawmakers cannot use, even for the next four years. Why do they have the Maintenance Department if any of the equipment breaks down?” In a memorandum sighted by our Correspondent, 11 office items cost a total of N367,479.33. The breakdown showed that a Samsung double door refrigerator was given out for N25,000; HP Envy Core 13, N49,000; Apple Ipad Air computer , N41,980; LED TV Samsung UA4600AR 50, N59,500.

Any member taking the entire 11 items would pay N349,970,50, with N17,498.83 as VAT for items.
