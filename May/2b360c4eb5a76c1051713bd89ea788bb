Nigeria’s first indigenous industrial Free Zone, LADOL, has commenced its annual safety week. This is the first time the company has held this event to highlight the company’s safety best practices, share learnings with stakeholders and set new targets for safety in the coming years. LADOL’s Managing Director, Dr Amy Jadesimi, said: “Safety and quality is at the heart of best business practices. While growing LADOL, we always put in place the policies, procedures and work instructions needed to ensure quality and safety for ourselves and our clients. “This week is a celebration of our many achievements including becoming the first company in West and North Africa to be ISO 45001 certified. The week is also a call to action as we have to continuously improve and reach greater heights each year. Thank you to all our staff and stakeholders for your years of hard work and support.” Speaking on the opening day of the event, LADOL’s Executive Director Business Development, Mr. Jide Jadesimi, who signed the safety commitment banner, said safety remains at the core of the company’s operations, “Because of the importance of this event and safe practice in the company, other personal engagements have to be put on hold. I want everyone to see themselves as safety champions. LADOL has reached a stage where we’ve grown to meet and exceed international standards, due to the hard work and talent of our staff and the support of our stakeholders. Well done to everyone for bringing your hearts and minds to everything we are doing,” LADOL’s safety, health, environment and quality (SHEQ) manager, Mr. Obi Mac-Arthur said that high safety culture is the cheapest and most effective insurance policy, stressing that safety isn’t a hobby, it’s a living. He said the choice of the theme for this year’s safety week “Making safe choices” was borne out of the need to continuously inculcate positive safety culture, ensuring zero risk tolerance in all operations.
