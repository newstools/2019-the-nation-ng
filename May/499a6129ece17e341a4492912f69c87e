Manchester City are as hungry ‘as lions’ as they bid to complete the domestic treble, captain Vincent Kompany has said. City will become the first team to win the Premier League, League Cup and FA Cup in the same season if they beat Watford at Wembley today. Pep Guardiola’s men claimed back-to-back Premier League titles with a 4-1 win against Brighton on the final day of the campaign and they will be looking to make history by defeating the Hornets for a third time this season. While they enjoyed their Premier League celebrations, Kompany insists the team are fired up for the challenge ahead. “It’s not about adding that achievement [the treble] to my CV, I don’t care about my CV,” Kompany told reporters ahead of today’s final, live on eir sport 1. “I know this team and they are like lions. When this team is hungry, they are such a special team. I’m going to do everything I can to put a bit of blood in that water, so this team gets even hungrier. “My style is pretty simple. Every now and then, when things are getting too comfortable, I go a little aggressive in training or I speak up and say what I think. “But the main thing is that these guys, together with the manager, are always able to understand what the priority is.”
