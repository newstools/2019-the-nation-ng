Grange School and Children International School have emerged champions in the Secondary and Primary School categories of the 4th Zenith Bank/Ikoyi Club Inter School Swimming Gala held Saturday at the elite Ikoyi Club, Lagos. Grange amassed nine gold, six eight silver and nine bronze medals to edge Edgewood School to second place on seven gold, one silver and three bronze medals while CIS came third with five gold, four silver and three bronze medals. Unlike the previous editions where the categories were held separately, a jam-packed Ikoyi Club with about 300 parents cheering their kids, the Primary School Category was fiercely contested with CIS taking just a shade to beat Saint Saviour’s School, Ikoyi to the title. CIS bagged nine gold, six silver and three bronze medals for the podium’s peak with Saint Saviour’s placing second with eight gold, nineteen silver and nine bronze medals leaving Grange with a consolatory third with five gold, four silver and seven bronze medals. Morinsola Idowu of Lagos Preparatory School was named the MVP for female for the primary category while Abduljabbar Adana of Corona School, for the third straight year, won the male version.
