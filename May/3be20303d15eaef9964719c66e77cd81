HarvestPlus Country Manager Nigeria Dr Paul Ilona has urged  agriculture universities to  promote sustainable supply of safe and healthy food. Ilona said agriculture-led economic growth could lead   to improved livelihood and nutrition, thereby providing long-lasting solution to poverty and food insecurity. He maintained that the country’s population  was increasing rapidly as such specialised universities needed to identify opportunities and strategies to contribute to healthier diets, create food security and end malnutrition. He urged universities to develop hubs for agricultural learning and address key knowledge gaps in the sector, including dealing with climate change and mitigating post-harvest losses. Ilona said it was time specialised agricultural universities model themselves as anchors for agricultural transformation, by developing interventions that impact rural development. While  Nigeria’s   economy is dependent on agriculture, he  noted, that  its contribution  to growth  was very  low, attributing this  to  challenges  such as  weak market linkages, minimal use of improved seeds, fertiliser and pesticides. Ilona noted that the relationship between specialised higher agricultural educational institutions and rural development have become an important concern, as the revitalisation of rural areas represents a critical challenge. To boost job creation and food security, he urged  agricultural universities, and other higher learning institutions to adjust their curricular programmes and to forge partnerships to end the scourge of food insecurity. At current rates of growth, he noted agriculture is the sector of the opportunity and that universities and other tertiary colleges of agriculture should centre on unemployment among youth and how to prepare them to create entrepreneurship opportunities in agriculture. He said practical strategies and solutions should be developed to enable young people to embrace sustainable agriculture.
