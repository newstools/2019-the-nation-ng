Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun has expressed optimism that many states would produce more legal property owners, if they take a cue from its Homeowners Charter Programme. The Governor stated this during the presentation of certificates of Occupancy and building plan approval, to the 39th batch of beneficiaries, at the Arcade Ground, Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Represented by his Senior Consultant, Mrs. Elizabeth Sonubi, Amosun said, a lot of people believed in having access to both land and houses of their own, saying, his administration’s laudable initiative  made it easier for residents to be legal property owners. ‘’I want to say that, if many states of the federation can emulate this kind of laudable programme, definitely a lot of property owners across the country will be proud legal owners of their properties, with documents to back it up’’, he said. Amosun assured that there would be the 40th edition of the programme, to enable more successful applicants the opportunity to have their land title documents. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Mr. Olusegun Olaleye, congratulated the beneficiaries for getting the reward of their faith in the Governor Amosun-led administration,  encouraging those that are yet to get their documents, not to lose hope . Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, the Baale of Ose-Arowolo in Osun State, Chief Hammed Iyanda Arowolo, who owned a property in Adiyan, Ifo Local Government Area, thanked the government for making their dreams come true, saying they would continue to support the Governor till the end of his tenure.
