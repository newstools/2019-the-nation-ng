The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the qualification of Senator Ademola Adeleke to contest the governorship election in Osun State. A lower court in Abuja had, a few weeks ago, pronounced Adeleke unqualified for the contest, a verdict which Adeleke appealed at the appellate court. In a statement Thursday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party described the judgment as a triumph of justice and the will of the people of Osun state over oppressive forces. It noted that the ruling of the Court of Appeal has finally put to rest all contentions about the educational qualification of Senator Adeleke and rendered all such cases in lower courts incompetent. The PDP further stated that the ruling of the lower court nullifying Senator Adeleke’s candidacy was wrong in the first place, stressing that the evidence before the court proved that Adeleke had met all the constitutional requirements for the election. ”The Appeal Court has affirmed justice and restored the verdict of the Osun people on the eligibility of our candidate to stand for election. “Moreover, the findings of the Appeal Court that the FCT High Court lacked powers to entertain the matter, since the issues therein are related to what transpired in Osun State, serves as a lesson to desperate politicians engaging in abuse of court processes”, the statement added. The PDP commended the Justices of the Court of Appeal for restoring the confidence reposed in the judiciary as the last hope of the common man. It counseled the APC and its agents to end their unnecessary attacks on Senator Adeleke and allow the people of Osun state to enjoy their much-desired benefits of having a competent, people-oriented and purposeful leadership under Senator Adeleke.
