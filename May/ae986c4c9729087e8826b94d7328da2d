THE Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institution (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics (SSANIP) of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta have embarked on an indefinite strike to protest the non-payment of members’ salaries and allowances. The duo locked the main entrance. The protesters were armed with placards bearing various inscriptions some of which read:”Amosun, where is our pension deduction; ‘Amosun, enough is enough’; ‘Amosun, pay our entitlement, our members are dying’. In a communiqué co-signed by the chairmen of NASU and SSANIP, Messrs. Kola Sopade and Olawunmi Musbau, the workers said they had issued an ultimatum to the management to pay their members’ outstanding salaries and allowances. The communiqué reads: “The union held a meeting with the management. The outcome of the meeting was given to the congress. “At the end of the meeting, the union members resolved that having stayed off action on the notice given to the management, the government should pay our outstanding four-month salary. Our contributory pension should be paid; Our cooperative dues should be paid without delay; and that our union dues should be paid. “The congress also expressed concerns over the incessant loss of lives of our members due to their inability to afford hospital bills occasioned by non-payment of salaries which again has caused the death of another staff. “After extensive deliberation, congress decided to embark on indefinite strike with effect from Friday, 26th April, 2019.” But the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP) MAPOLY chapter has distanced itself from the strike. Its Chairman Babatunde Osifalujo told CAMPUSLIFE that lecturers were not part of the strike, adding that lectures were ongoing.
