A National Industrial Court (NIC) in Lagos on Thursday restrained the Nigerian Union of Journalist (NUJ) and four others from conducting yesterday’s National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) election following an application by a contestant. Justice R.H. Gwandu made the order after hearing a motion ex parte filed and argued by Omotayo Olatunbosun, a counsel representing a NAWOJ chairmanship contestant, Mrs Sekinah Lawal. The judge granted the application and ordered the stoppage of the poll, which was scheduled for yesterday morning, pending the determination of Lawal’s suit. Joined as first to sixth defendants in the suit marked NICN/LA/248/2019, are: Ekene Adeola, the Registered Trustees of the NUJ, Ifeyinwa Omole, Ladi Lawal, Mrs Abiola Beckley and Mrs Yemisi Adeniran. The interim injunction restrained the respondents from recognising first defendant Adeola as chairperson candidate in the election. It also restrained the body responsible for the conduct of the election from going ahead with it. After granting the prayers, the judge ordered that the defendants be put on notice and ordered an accelerated hearing of the suit. Justice Gwandu also warned parties that any attempt of omission or commission concerning the order could be treated as contempt of court. The case was adjourned till May 30, 2019.
