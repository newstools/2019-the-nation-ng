Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has proffered strategies for achieving industrial harmony. He said human resources are rightly regarded as the bedrock of any organisation, since organisations are dependent on human capacity for the supply of labour, technical and professional skills, which are germane to effective and efficient planning and implementation of development policies, programmes, projects and daily activities. Speaking yesterday in Ikeja, Lagos, at a two-day training for labour leaders and trade unions at a seminar titled: “Effective Management Strategies in Labour Relations Practice”, facilitated by Messrs. Human Capital Management & Solutions Ltd, Ambode, represented by Establishment, Training and Pension Commissioner Dr. Akintola Benson-Oke, said there was a well thought-out and sequential model on industrial relations practices, adding that instead of suppressing conflicts, specific channels should be created to make the conflicts explicit and specific methods should be used through which conflict would be resolved. “It is in furtherance of this philosophical approach to industrial and labour relations that the government has approved this training/seminar to enable the leadership of the trade unions continue deliberation on the topic of the training. “The harmonious relationship between the government and the trade unions in the public service is a testimony to the relevance, importance, competence and strategic indispensability of Albert Low’s philosophy on governance,” he said. The Acting Vice Chancellor, Eastern Palm University, Ogboko, Imo State, Prof. Dafe Otobo, hailed the Lagos State Government for maintaining industrial harmony with workers. He urged it not to rest on its oars. “I will suggest that to sustain the atmosphere of industrial harmony in the state and transform such harmony into greater productivity, there are other values the state must continue to live by,” Otobo said.
