Students under the umbrella of the Kwara state students and Youth Stakeholders yesterday impress it on the state Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed to reopen the Kwara state University (KWASU) shut by the management of the institution. Authorities of the state-owned university had last week announced the closure of the institution. The closure of KWASU was as a result of protest by students of the school over Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed’s appointment of acting Vice Chancellor Prof Kenneth Adeyemi for the institution. Tenure of the current Vice Chancellor of the school, Prof Abdulrasheed Na’Allah expires July this year. Addressing reporters in Ilorin, the state capital, Chairman of the group Sa’eed Yusuf described the closure of the institution by management as a flagrant disregard to constituted authority. He said: “We call on Governor Ahmed to reopen the university with immediate effect, if indeed the purported ‘closure has any force of the law; immediately suspend Prof Sakah Mahmud for grossin-subordination to Governor Ahmed, despite being aware of the appointment of acting vice chancellor; powerfully call Prof Na’Allah to order and ask him to stay clear of the VC’s office based on the appointment of an acting VC and having been granted a terminal leave; reiterate the appointment of Prof Adeyemi as the acting VC to work with the council of the university to complete the work of engaging another VC for the university; direct the council to source only for the best candidate that can drive the growth and development in the university.” He urged the governor to “direct the council based on equity, fairness and justice, recommend people only from the South and Northern parts of the state to produce the next vice chancellor of the school.”
