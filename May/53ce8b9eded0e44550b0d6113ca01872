The Federal Government has finally broken the rank of pensioners after series of failed attempts with the registration of two new pension unions. Minister of Labour and Employment Dr Chris Ngige, who announced the registration of the two new unions at his valedictory session yesterday, said the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) will not take care of pensioners in federal ministries and agencies under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS). The two new unions are Nigerian Union of Contributory Pensioners to cater for contributory pensioners and the Parastatals and Private Sector Pensioners Association of Nigeria. Ngige said: “The ministry over the years has ensured the entrenchment of the rule of law in trade unionism. Thus, in consonance with section 3 of the Trade Union Act 2004, Cap T.8 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria and following a recent judgement of the National Industrial Court, the Nigerian Union of Pensioners was regrouped for effective delivery of services to pensioners. The Nigerian Union of Contributory Pensioners will cater for contributory pensioners, and the Parastatals and Private Sector Pensioners Association will take care of pensioners under that bracket. “The old Nigeria Union of Pensioners now takes only non contributory pensioners from the federal ministries and the public service  regrouping for efficiency  as per the powers conferred on the minister by that section of the Act.” He also said the Ministry  may requests from various associations for recognition and registration as trade unions for workers and workers federation.
