Tucana is designed to be the fastest, reliable and most secure web host in Africa, Nigeria particularly. The replication site, Microsoft Azure is the largest server in the world with more than 140 data centers globally and a presence in each continent of the world. Hence, websites hosted on Tucana have 99.9% uptime. In a bid to resolve the traffic within the Nigerian airspace, Tucana has chosen its primary extension to be .NG. “This is because we want the traffic to be regulated in Nigeria.

We also have accreditation with NIRA as one of the .NG premium providers which as a result, makes our domain cheaper” he says.
