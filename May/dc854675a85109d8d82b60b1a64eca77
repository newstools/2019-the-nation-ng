Three host communities of Egbin Power Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos State – Ijede, Egbin and Ipakan – have accused the management of the plant as well as Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC), the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and other stakeholders of treating them with disdain. They threatened to confront the companies if their demands are not met as soon as possible. Their grouse is that the companies got over 9,000 plots of land from the communities about 40 years ago but have not paid any compensation on the land. They said the communities gave the land to the power plant via an official Gazette Number 30, Volume 68, of June 26, 1981.
