The Chief Executive Officer, AXA Group, Thomas Buberl,  has met with some women entrepreneurs in Lagos. According to a statement by the company, the event had as its theme: “Role of women in deepening financial and insurance inclusion”. Buberl emphasised the need to empower women entrepreneurs. He said: “In insurance, if we look at how products are designed, it’s very male-oriented, but we’ve been working a lot to see how we can launch products that are more women-focused addressing the distinct needs of women which men do not have. “A key point covered at the session was how to create more opportunities for female entrepreneurs to access insurance products in Nigeria. Women entrepreneurs play a vital role in unlocking economic growth as they provide majority of the labour with little resources. “What we see clearly is that there is an immense power that women bring to the society, be it as entrepreneurs, or leaders in the society. Yes, we can say we have made a few advancements, but it is never enough, we need to get even further in empowering women in the society. At AXA, we are looking at ways to reduce stumbling blocks for female entrepreneurs in business.” Buberl is visiting Nigeria for the second time. His first was in May 2016.
