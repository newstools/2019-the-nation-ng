As your children grow into teenagers and then, youths, it becomes more difficult to understand what they are thinking or feeling. Teenagers face a host of pressures, from the changes of puberty to questions about who they are and where they fit in. Most of the time, parents pass these emotions as mood swings. But this is a serious problem that has an impact on the health of your teen. 1. Know the common warning signs of suicide : They include making suicidal statements, being preoccupied with death in conversation, writing, or drawing, withdrawing from friends and family, having aggressive or hostile behaviour and change in personality of your child. 2. Take away any drug and weapon from their immediate surrounding: Check the environment for any knives, guns, narcotic medications, rat poison, or anything else that can be used as a weapon. Lock these items away so the child cannot use them to hurt themselves. 3. Get professional help: The most common cause of suicide among youth is depression and one of the ways to help battle the illness is to take them to either a therapist or professional depression counselor. The therapist will likely create a safety plan for the child, which includes contact numbers and resources they can access if they feel suicidal. 4. Be an active listener: Do not be judgmental and critical in communicating with your child. Rather than criticizing them, be empathetic and compassionate. Let the child know that you understand whatever it is that they might be going through. 5. Spend quality time with them: Suicidal children may be more likely to pull away from others and spend time alone. Stress the importance of social engagement and provide opportunities for them to spend time with friends and family. Also, pursuing their hobbies and passions can help the child feel better about life and remember things they are good at.
