A group, the Association of Nigeria Church Ushers and Protocols (ANCUP), yesterday expressed readiness to help churches fight killings, kidnapping, vandalism and stealing. At a news conference in Ikeja, Lagos, ahead of its June 3 unveiling of the Church Interpol Initiative, its Publicity Secretary, Adedayo Osunmakinde, said the church defence squad would prevent crimes from happening in the church. “The Church Interpol is an interdenominational church defence department, fused with visible and invisible intelligence personnel and set to fight church crime on a larger scale. It is a non-uniform secret service enforcement squad with an outlook slogan: ‘Dismantling the tools of crime in the church’. “The department is set to cut across borders in fighting church crime and to tackle other security challenges confronting churches. It will serve as the first layer of policing in the church and will operate in the format of Secret Service Agent; a visible and non-visible Christian intelligence personnel. They will be visible to deter any potential attacker from making move, while invisible to be able to react to any security breach,” he said. Osunmakinde said the association had trained over 677 volunteers across denominations, adding that the training was free and continuous. “Each church will bring its volunteers for the association to train and they (volunteers) will carry out the assignment in their churches’’.
