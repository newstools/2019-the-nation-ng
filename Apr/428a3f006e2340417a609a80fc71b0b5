Unidentified gunmen numbering about seven at the weekend abducted Mr. Wellington Magbisa, the father of the Caretaker Chairman of Sagbama Local Government Area, Michael. It was gathered that the kidnappers gained access to their victim’s house through an unprotected window, seized him and took him away. Sources said the incident, which happened early hours of Sunday, caused panic in Sagbama and caused confusion in Magbisa’s family. The abductors reportedly whisked their victim away to an unknown place through the waterways. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Butswat Asinim, confirmed the incident and said the police were investigating the matter. “The gunmen numbering about five gained access to the house of the victim through an unprotected widow and took him away through the waterways. The police are doing everything possible to locate their whereabouts”, he said.
