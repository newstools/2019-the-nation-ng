A self-proclaimed bureau de change operator, Edwin Nwankwo, was Thursday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly obtaining $15,500 under the guise of supplying the naira equivalent. Nwankwo, 51, is standing trial on a three-count charge of fraud and stealing before Mr. B. I. Bakare. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh told the court that the defendant and his accomplices on the run committed the alleged offences sometime in November 2018, in Lagos. He alleged that the defendant fraudulently obtained $15,500 from one Abdulmalik Yunusa, “under the pretext of being a bureau de change operator who would supply the naira equivalent of the dollar once his dollar account was credited”. According to Mameh, the defendant knew that his representation was false, but deceived the complainant into crediting his dollar account with the said money. “The defendant received the money but did not give the naira equivalent of the money,” Mameh said. The offences, he added, contravened Sections 287(9), 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Nwankwo pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Bakare granted him N750, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on May 22.
