National Association of commercial motorcycle and tricycle owners and riders association has applauded the imposition of curfew on motorcycles and tricycles in Zamfara State, considering the escalating security situation in the state where its members are made to be the scapegoats. “We have been receiving reports of our members being killed, machete or doped while their motorcycles carted away, especially in the night hours,  but with the curfew on motorcycles and tricycles in place, the reports are no more there.” Zamfara State chairman of the association, Usman Muhammad Haido, disclosed this to The Nation while reacting to imposition of restriction of motorcycle and tricycle from 7PM to 6AM in the state. Haido explained that when security threat is rampant, drastic measures that may not augur well to many people have to be taken to arrest the situation. He revealed that they had wanted the curfew hours to be reduced from 9PM to 6AM but considering the situation at hand, it has changed their demand after their meeting with the state Commissioner of Police Thursday. “We have also told the police that if any of our member is caught violating the law,  he should face the full wrath of the law as we cannot go to ask for his bail and if they arrest anybody without ID Card, then he is not our member, “ Haido said He revealed that restrictions of the movements of motorcycles in Zamfara State have been existence for years. According to him it is only when security threat becomes low that the law is relaxed saying that the law should have not been imposed on all the local governments but that also becomes necessary in order to fully control the situation.
