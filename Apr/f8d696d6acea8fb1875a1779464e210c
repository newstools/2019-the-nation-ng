National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), has honoured Dr. A.O.J. Adebowale. Adebowale is Head of Department, Petroleum Engineering and Geo-Sciences (PEG) at the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Delta State. NANS Deputy Senate President Pedro Chibuzor and Director of Welfare and Contact, Comrade Jeremiah Friday Ohomah (aka Apple water), led NANS’ team to PTI where Adebowale was decorated. The event, which took place at the institute’s library, was witnessed by some top principal officers alongside students and workers. “After series of consultations, NANS decided to bestow on Dr. Adebowale ‘Icon of Hope and Inspiration’ award to Nigerian students,” said Jeremiah. “This is in view of his meritorious contributions to students’ development and nation building,” he added. Jeremiah described the awardee as a very humble, simple, honest and a dedicated man, adding that Adebowale will always be acknowledged for paying student’ tuition, taking them on free professional tours, as well as establishing a sound students/lecturer relationship. Adebowale, who is the Faculty Adviser of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), expressed his gratitude to NANS. “I am very delighted, the award came at the time I was not expecting it. I was just living my life, the way I was created, not knowing that people are watching me, I am humble,” Adebowale said. “I dedicate the award to God Almighty and the Principal/Chief Executive of Petroleum Training Institute, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke, who has always been there for me. I will ever remain loyal to his excellent leadership style. I also appreciate all staff of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences and my beautiful wife for her support,” he added. Adebowale advised lecturers to  exercise caution in the way they relate with students. “Whatever you do to the students today will reflects in your relationship with them in the future,” he advised.
