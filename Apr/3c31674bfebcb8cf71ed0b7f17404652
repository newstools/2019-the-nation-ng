The Chief of Army Staff (CoAS), Lt-Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai, has described the fight against terrorism as complex. He said the phenomenon requires multiple efforts, including co-operation of all citizens to combat. Buratai, who spoke at the opening of the second Infantry Conference in Jaji Military Cantonment, Kaduna State, said the Armed Forces had performed creditably well and would continue to protect the territorial integrity of Nigeria. He said: “Today, we have the full initiative and in collaboration with other sister agencies. We are pushing hard to ensure that we finally sanitised the northern Borno and our border axis with Niger, Chard and Cameroon. “We know they have plans, but we are also planning to counter them and we will deploy maximum intelligence to capture those that still remain in the hinterland. “Terrorism is a complex warfare which needs the involvement of every individual in the country. If we are able to do so, we will contain the criminals. “It should not be left to the security personnel or governments at all levels or the traditional rulers alone. It is a joint responsibility and we are all stakeholders. “These criminals are not coming from the blues. They live among us in the society. They go to the markets and buy foodstuffs, just like the rest of us. “Some of them go to naming, marriage ceremonies and so on. It is our responsibility to make everybody aware that we all have a role to play in bringing the activities of these criminal elements to an end.” The Commander of Infantry Corps, Maj.-Gen. Stevenson Olusegun Olabanji said: “The nation is currently grappling with a lot of security challenges with the scourge of terrorism in the Northeast being the most prominent. “The Infantry Corps has been at the vanguard of the Army’s efforts in combating these multi-prolonged threats and, in the process, making high demands on our personnel, equipment other materials.”
