A Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Aramoko-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has sentenced a pastor and eight others to six months imprisonment for failure to provide toilet facilities in their houses. The convicts were also jailed for other sanitation offences such as practising open defecation and refusing to provide waste bins in their houses. They were brought to court from Aramoko, Erio, Ido Ile, all in Ekiti West Local Government. Of the 18 people arraigned at the court by environmental health officers, nine pleaded guilty and were convicted. The convicts are Pastor Olaleye Isaac, Chief Ologun Ala, Mr. Titus Ibironke, Chief Jacob Taiwo, Mr. Sunday Adesoba, Mrs. Olu Obateru, Mr. Adetoyinbo, Mr. Agboola and Mr. Atoro. Magistrate Abayomi Adeosun sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment with options of fines ranging from N5,000 to N15,000. Lamenting the environmental nuisance caused by open defecation, he held that the sentence would deter others. The magistrate issued a bench warrant for the arrest of nine others who failed to appear in court for similar offences. He ordered the police to present them for prosecution on April 25.
