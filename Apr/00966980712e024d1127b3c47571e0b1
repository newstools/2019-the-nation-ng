Mercedes-Benz closed the first quarter of 2019 with 560,873 passenger cars sold worldwide (-5.6 per cent). For the third year in a row, sales in the first quarter were therefore, well over 550,000 units. In March, 227,644 vehicles with the three-pointed star were delivered to customers all over the world (-4.1 per cent). The first three months of the year featured important model changes in the highest-volume SUV and compact-car segments. The company expects an increasing vehicle availability in the next months and therefore, global sales to increase slightly overall in 2019. Since the beginning of the year, Mercedes-Benz has maintained its market leadership in the premium segment in Germany, United Kingdom (UK), France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Denmark, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Brazil and other markets. Britta Seeger, member of the board of management of Daimler AG responsible for Mercedes-Benz cars marketing and sales said: “We are delighted with the best quarter ever for Mercedes-Benz in China and the successful market launch of the new B-Class in Europe. The first three months of the year were challenging worldwide due to the ongoing model changes for SUVs and compact cars. “In the coming months, further highlights of our current model offensive at Mercedes-Benz will be launched. The CLA Coupé, for example, will be available in our showrooms in May. From the middle of the year, the ungraded generation of our very popular midsize SUVs GLC and GLC Coupé will then be available at our dealerships.”
