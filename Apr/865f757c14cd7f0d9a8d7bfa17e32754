The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) has declared a state of public health concern on maternal newborn and child death occurring at the primary health centres. Similar declaration is expected in states in the next few days to track maternal and child mortality. Nigeria has one of the worst records in maternal and child mortality in the world. It is recorded that in Nigeria approximately 145 women under the age of 15-45 die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth while 2300 children under five years old die mainly from preventable causes. Consequently, the agency said it will establish a national coordination centre within the agency to provide oversight on the outlined activities. The centre, according to the Executive Director of the agency, Dr. Fasal Shuaib shall be called the National Emergency Maternal and Child Health Intervention Centre. (NEMCHIC). Already, the country has received support worth $1.3l million which is to be matched by the government $1.97 million for the next ten years. This fund is to support the countryâ€™s immunization programme as part of the effort to reduce maternal and child mortality in Nigeria. The states also assured of their buy-in to ensure that the initiative achieves its purpose.
