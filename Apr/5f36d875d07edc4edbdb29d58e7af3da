New kid on the block, Guchi, has dropped her debut single titled ‘No Be Jazz’, Monday. The vivacious singer revealed this over the weekend in an interaction with journalists. Produced by Beats by Jayy and mixed and mastered by Mixed Monster, the song, according to Guchi, 22, preaches the virtues of love and patience. She said ‘No Be Jazz’ was inspired by her mother whom she says loves all her songs. “In the good times and in the bad times, my mother was with my dad,” said Guchi, whose real name is Ugochi Onuoha. “But now, everybody wants the money. The song is preaching genuine love. It’s preaching trust.” The video of the song which was produced by Unlimited L.A was also released today. Popular on the Abuja music circuit where she grew up, Guchi, who sings Afropop, dance and highlife, has been doing music since 2012. However, for better visibility, she relocated to Lagos less than six months ago. And expressing her confidence of taking the Nigerian music industry by storm, Guchi, who is currently a student of Theatre and Media Arts of the University of Lagos and has a management deal with MVP, said: “I started music in 2012. I didn’t come out in 2012. That’s because I’ve been preparing for this. I have dozens of songs recorded this year. And I’m still going to record.” Guchi said that her album will be released before the end of the year.
