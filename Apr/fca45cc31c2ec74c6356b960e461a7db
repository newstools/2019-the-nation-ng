The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Kalu winner of the poll in the February elections and the Commission had since issued Kalu with Certificate of Return. Ohuabunwa is a sitting senator elected on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but Kalu contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). But he said INEC breached its own guidelines by giving Kalu the certificate of return, stressing that the “margin of win” recorded by Kalu was far less than the number of cancelled votes in that election. The senator said, “Kalu knows that what he has is a stolen mandate which he will soon surrender. “He knows the truth but only thinks he can play smart. But unfortunately for him, we are resolute in reclaiming the people’s mandate”. Leaders of the PDP in Abia who were on solidarity visits to the senators, also vowed to ensure the party explored every available means permissible in law to retrieve the mandate from Kalu. Zonal chairman of the PDP, Mr. Mathew Ibe, who led the delegation of party chieftains to Ohuabunwa, said there was overwhelming evidence to believe that Kalu’s election cannot stand the scrutiny of electoral laws. Ibe appealed to the Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu and the national leadership of the PDP to give Ohuanbunwa all the support he needed to retrieve the party’s mandate.
