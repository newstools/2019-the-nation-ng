A 50-year-old woman simply identified as ‘Iya Dunsi’, who was a palm oil seller, has been reportedly killed near her home at Odiolowo, Arigidi-Akoko, Ondo State, by suspected ritualists. Sources said the ritualists removed the breasts of the deceased, who was an indigene of Ikaram-Akoko in Akoko Northwest Local Government Area of the state. Her body was said to have been dropped about 100 metres to her house. The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) for Okeagbe-Akoko, Ibitayo Adetanranmi, a Superintendent of Police (SP), confirmed the incident. He said the culprits would be arrested. The Ikare Area Commander, Razak Rauf, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), said criminals like ritualists would not be spared. Three similar incidents happened late last year at Ikare-Akoko involving women. Their private parts were removed. An eight-year old pupil of St. George’s Anglican Primary School, Oke-Agbe, the headquarters of Akoko Northwest, was also killed in similar circumstances.
