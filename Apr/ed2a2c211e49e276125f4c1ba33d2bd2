A former teacher at Isolog Group of Schools, Agbole Akute, Ogun State, who fled after he was accused of sodomising pupils, has been arrested. The suspect, Adebayo Gbadebo, was arrested on Monday night after the school officials mandated to produce him, did so. It was gathered that the suspect had gone to the police division with a lawyer with the hope that he would be granted bail. The Nation learnt that the lawyer demanded that another medical examination be conducted on the latest victim, who had earlier been taken to the Mirabel Centre, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), when the latest alleged sodomy was uncovered. Confirming his arrest, spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), told our correspondent that the commissioner has ordered the transfer of the case to the anti-human/child trafficking unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), for investigation. He confirmed that the suspect came with a lawyer, who requested an independent medical examination on the child, but his request was turned down because the police station was not the court, neither would they allow the victim to be subjected to further emotional and psychological torture. Oyeyemi said: “Yes, the man has been arrested and the commissioner of police has directed his transfer to the anti-human and child trafficking unit for further investigation. “They came with a lawyer and we disagreed on certain issues. They said they wanted to go and conduct independent test on the girl, but we told them we are not the court and since the division cannot handle the case at that level, the case has to be moved to the SCIID for expert investigation. “It was the school that brought him after the police compelled them to produce him. The school concealed the incident when it occurred. They just fired him and that was all.
