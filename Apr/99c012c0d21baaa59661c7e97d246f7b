THE candidacy of the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, as the Speaker of the Ninth House got a boost yesterday as Muhammad Monguno withdrew his ambition. Monguno, one of the frontline contenders, immediately declared his support for Gbajabiamila based on All Progressives Congress (APC) decision and personal conviction. Monguno, who is the current Chairman Committee on Agricultural Productions and Services, said the decision of APC supersedes personal ambitions. Besides being an advocate of party supremacy and a loyal party member, Monguno said having zoned the Senate Presidency to the Northeast, fairness dictates that House members from the same region should naturally drop Speakership ambition.
