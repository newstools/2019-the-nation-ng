Nigeria Rugby national team, Black Stallions star, Thankgod Okafor is in cloud nine after helping RC Montemor to win the Portuguese national rugby championship title, NationSport reports. “Words cannot describe the happiness and joy I have at this moment of being a champion my God is good all the times I shall forever praise your name. There is always a say ‘do your best and leave the rest to God almighty’. I’m very proud of the boys for a fantastic performance and will like to take this opportunity and thank the Montemor staff especially Todinha for being with me in the hospital after having a hectic concussion during the match feeling much better all thanks to God,” the Black Stallions center and winger said. RC Montemor won the national championship of the first rugby division, corresponding to the second national level, by beating Benfica 17-11 in the final in Lisbon last weekend. The Alentejanos scored the first try through Okafor (33 minutes) and Miguel Casadinho (65), both of them converted by João Bibe, who totaled seven points. Bibe then increased their lead with a 53 meter drop goal to put the game beyond benefica’s reach. RC Montemor won the third title in the second tier after having also won the title in 2013 and 2016. Okafor has been in top form for Montemor since joining from Cowrie Rugby Football Club in December 2017. Okafor was born in Nigeria, but he grew up in South Africa’s Durban province. He joined Sharks Rugby Academy in 2012 at the age of 18 and continued to develop through the ranks. He later joined Varsity College in 2015 and Cowrie Rugby Club in 2016.
