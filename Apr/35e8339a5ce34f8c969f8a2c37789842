Real Madrid stumbled to a 1-1 draw at Leganes on Monday, the latest disappointing result in a nightmare season for the European champions. Zinedine Zidaneâ€™s side, who are third in the table and 13 points behind leaders Barcelona, were uninspired against local rivals Leganes. Madrid put in the kind of lethargic performance which has plagued their season, with Marco Asensio and Raphael Varane missing good first-half chances. Jonathan Silva fired Leganes ahead in the 45th minute with their first chance of the game, driving home from the edge of the box. Leganes, 11th in the table, went close to winning the game but Youssef En-Nesyri had a goal correctly disallowed for offside. (Reuters/NAN)
