Market analysts agreed that the rebound was due to the onset of first quarter earnings, especially the positive results released by leading first-tier banks. “The week’s positive close and sentiment can be attributed to the positive first quarter 2019 results that have started to filter in. We opine that investors will continue to take position in attractive stocks ahead of earnings expectations,” Afrinvest Securities stated. Analysts at Cordros Capital also attributed the rebound to earnings season, noting that strong numbers reported by most first-tier banks and other companies renewed sentiment for naira risk assets. “We reiterate our view that the blend of a compelling valuation story, together with positive macroeconomic picture leaves scope for a market recovery in the medium term. However, we guide investors to tread the cautious trading path in the short term,” Cordros Capital stated.
