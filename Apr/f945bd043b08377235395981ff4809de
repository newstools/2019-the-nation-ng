A group of lawyers in Bauchi State known as the Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience (BOBOLAC), has called for the immediate appointment of the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed, as substantive CJN. The group also called on the National Judicial Council, (NJC) and the Federal Judicial Service Commission (FJSC ), to comply with the provisions of Section 231 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) that relates to the appointment of a substantive CJN. The call followed the removal of the embattled and erstwhile CJN, Walter Onnoghen, who was suspended from office in a judgement delivered by Chairman,Â  Code of Conduct Tribunal Chairman, Danladi Uma, last week. Buhari appointed Muhammad who hail from Bauchi State, acting CJN in January after Walter Onnoghen, was suspended. Addressing a media conference yesterday, BOBOLAC through its convener, Shipi Rabo, urged the relevant authorities to set in motion the machinery necessary for the appointment of Justice Tanko Muhammad as CJN.
