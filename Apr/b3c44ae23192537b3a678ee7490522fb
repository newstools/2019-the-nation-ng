Newly-admitted students of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University (IBBU), Lapai, in Niger State, have been advised to be committed to their studies and avoid vices that contravene the rules and regulations of the school. The university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Muhammad Nasir Maiturare, also called on them to be prayerful and hardworking so as to actualise their dreams. Prof Maiturare, who spoke during the matriculation of new students at the university’s premises, noted that in 2018/2019 academic session, a total of 3,638 UTME and Direct Entry candidates were offered admission. He said the university has zero tolerance for cultism, examination malpractice, poor academic performance and improper use of the social media, among other ills. Maiturare also announced to excited guests that in no distant time the College of Medicine will take off. He praised Niger State government for its continued support towards the growth and development of the school. Representative of Niger State government Mallam Jibrin Baba Ndace, revealed that approval has been given for the construction of a 500-bed space for both male and female hostels. Ndace, who is the Chief Press Sectary (CPS) to the Niger State governor, Abubakar  Sani Bello, cautioned the students against disseminating fake news and hate speeches on social media in order not to instigate violence and mutual distrust among the general public. Similarly, an Islamic cleric Sheikh Umar Dada Paiko and Prof. Yetunde Olorusanya of the institution’s Faculty of Agriculture, both admonished the students to always exhibit good moral behaviours and shun acts which may portray them, and in extension, the school, in negative light.
