I wanted a place that offers so many different types of entertainment that it is impossible for customers to get bored. At Silver Fox, we don’t cut corners.” He said: “Silver Fox is a passionate idea. Wanting to create a luxurious and world-class setting for gentlemen to let out all inhibitions, get loose, enjoy pleasures of the world through the eyes of a woman, and most importantly to have fun. “I spent most of my life in Miami, Florida, though my mum is Nigerian; owning several strip clubs in Jacksonville Florida, Toronto and Caracas Venezuela. Adult night club is not just a business to me, it’s a passion, and with my experience, I decided it was time to come home, seeing how fast and big the entertainment and hospitality business in Nigeria is growing. I felt the ultimate gentlemen’s club experience should be introduced to Nigeria.” Founded in 2014, Silver Fox is focused on delivering premium and exquisite nightlife services. “We move with the trends and the trends moves with us,” Big Slim said. “Strip clubs are part of the hip hop culture, rappers sing or rap about being in strip clubs and making it rain so this is ingrained in that culture and it’s my objective to change Africa with that same attitude and Silver Fox is here to do that.
