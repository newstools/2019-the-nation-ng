Youth wing of Ohaneze Ndigbo has condemned the alleged killings of six farmers in Mmiata Anam in Anambra West local government area of Anambra state. National leader of the group, Amb. Dr. Arthur Obiorah Uchena, stated this on Wednesday while briefing newsmen in Awka, Anambra State. He asked South East government to move in unisom to condemn the invasion of farmers involved in the ill-fated early morning herdsmen attacks. He regretted that victims were youths who died in their prime, while their hunters have been living without being brought to justice. Uchena warned that urgent steps must be taken by relevant security authorities to prevent a repeat of such carnage on Igbo youths in their land. He said, ‘’When I read about the killings of these six innocent Igbo farmers in Anambra state, I felt shocked to my bone marrow. “How would someone be in his ancestral land and would be slaughtered by foreigners with the intent to have access to their land for grazing. “I am sad and mourning as I am speaking with you all now. I urge our leaders to intervene speedily to forestall a repeat of such unsolicited carnage on our land. “We are not ready to lose the lives of any Igbo man again to any Fulani herdsmen clash and their host community that is much I can say about that for now.”
