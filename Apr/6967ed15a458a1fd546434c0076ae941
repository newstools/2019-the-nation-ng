Tiwa Savage has been unveiled as brand ambassador for Star Radler. The announcement was made at a special event hosted at Muri Okunola Park, on March 29, 2019. She becomes the first ever female to be officially signed on as an advocate for the beer brand, as she joins an elite bracket of superstars to be associated with Star. In January, Burna Boy was announced as the first ever brand ambassador for Star Lager and the popstar’s unveiling was followed by a commercial which earned widespread acclaim. Now with Tiwa’s unveil, fans of the Afro-pop sensation will be eagerly anticipating the creative ways the brand intends to exploit this landmark relationship. Tiwa Savage is no stranger to “firsts”, last year she became the first ever Africa female to win a BET Award, etching her name in the history books in the process. Since her emergence in the Nigerian music scene, Tiwa has released three studio albums which have earned critical and commercial success. Her illustrious career has also seen her rise to becoming arguably the African queen of music. Speaking on the unveil, Tiwa expressed her delight at becoming the first ever woman to be a brand ambassador for Star, “Star is a great brand and I’m thrilled to have joined the Star family. I’ve always loved the Radler brand and it’s an amazing opportunity to be the official face of the brand. The taste is quite exquisite! The Star brand is all about inspiring people to dream for bigger, greater things. Every Nigerian is somewhat aspirational, and this is a theme I try to imbibe in my music. I can’t wait for what the future holds with Star as I urge everyone to be on the lookout for us.”
