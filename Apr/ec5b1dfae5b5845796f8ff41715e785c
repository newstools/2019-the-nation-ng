There won’t be major changes in the transfer market, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stated. He said there is no “quick fix” to the club’s struggles. “There will be new players coming in over summer but I don’t think you can expect six,” Solskjaer said. “I don’t think any manager you ask would be in favour of that amount of change anyway. “We want to rebuild but it is going to have to be gradual, over a few windows. “We plan to be in the top four, we plan to be in the Champions League next season and we want players who can keep us in the Champions League and move us up the table. But we know there is not going to be a quick fix. We have to take it step by step.” United have lost five out of their past seven matches and Solskjaer has warned any under-performing players they will be moved towards the exit. “When I was given the job there was an understanding that we had to get Manchester United’s DNA back into the club and the team,” he added. “That doesn’t mean I want to live in the past. It would be naive to tell players to do all the same things we did when I played. But I want to create a culture that we all believe in. “When I played the manager trusted us and we took responsibility for our own careers. “If anyone stepped out of bounds, they wouldn’t stay here long. That’s the way it has to be at a club like this.”
