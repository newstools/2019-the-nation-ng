Today more than any other time in history, there’s a strong call to amplify the achievements of females in our society across different sectors, Divisional Director, Retail at AXA Mansard Insurance plc, Mrs. Rashidat Adebisi, has said. In a statement made available to reporters  in Lagos, Adebisi said this is why AXA Mansard sponsored SME 100 Africa Event in commemoration of the international women’s month. According to her, the event with the theme:   “Balancing for Better; The Rise of the Female Economy,” had various women from different sectors of government, private sector, the academia, small business owners, professionals and housewives present to discuss several issues that have been limiting women in their fields. She said: “Everyone is encouraged to reflect as a society on the roles of women as managers, professionals, teachers and agents of change, to bring to light how far women in Nigeria have come, and what needs to be done in the overall achievement of gender parity. “The gender differences in participation rates in labour markets have narrowed significantly in recent times. The female labour force participation rate today is higher compared to what it was some decades ago. It is therefore safe to say that women have become an important segment for every sector to target including insurance and other non-banking financial sectors. “We at AXA Mansardm AXA Mansard, a member of the AXA, one of the global leaders in insurance and asset management are very proud to be a part of an event like this which highlights the part that women play in the development of any economy. AXA is set to partner with women across all groups, sectors, life stages and varying peculiar needs all over Nigeria to form a formidable network among the women while providing the needed support to enable them grow and help them live better lives”, she added.
