The Federal Government has warned Nigerians seeking to study medicine in Ukraine to be sure of the institution first before enrolling. The country in the last two years had recorded high rate of failure among foreign-trained doctors who sat for the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN). Most of the students involved were said to have studied in Ukraine. The Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole in a press statement made available to Journalists in Abuja pointed out that the Ukrainian Ministry of Health said it cannot guarantee the quality of education of a university in the Eastern European country. “The Federal Government had recently been notified by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health that it could not guarantee the quality of education delivered to both Ukrainian and foreign students by the Odessa National Medical University. “The decision by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health was based on the result of an International Monitoring Study of Quality of Higher Medical Education conducted in Ukrainian Medical Universities dated March 25, from which the Odessa Medical University exempted itself.
