Former Super Eagles’ captain, Peter Osaze Odemwingie has hailed the level of unity and commitment in the current crop of the senior national football team, saying they have become a united force, AOIFootball.com reports. “Over the years, the Eagles have become more of a team. Team game and team effort rather than the individual play or big talent play of the past. It’s a solid team I must admit. The World Cup was alright, they were unlucky a bit against Argentina and should have gone beyond the first round,” Osaze said. Osaze, who spoke to AOIFootball.com during the FIFA Women’s World Cup trophy tour in Abuja, stated that the team has now drifted from individuality to a United front. He, however, did not comment on the team’s chances in Egypt but believes they have a strong squad that can hold their own at the biannual tournament. Having captained Nigeria at the 2010 AFCON, the former Lille of France forward featured for the country 63 times, netting 10 goals in the process, including the winner against Bosnia at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil which earned Nigeria its first win since France’98.
