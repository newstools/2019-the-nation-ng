A new faction of pensioners union, called Federal Parastatals and Private Sector Pensioners Association of Nigeria (FEPPPAN), has applied to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment for registration as a trade union representing the interest of the nation’s pensioners. The application officially creates a faction in the pensioners’ union, after the National Industrial Court (NIC) dismissed an application by the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) seeking to stop the Minister of Labour and the Registrar of Trade Unions from attending to them. Interim President of the factional pensioners’ union, Chief Temple Ubani, told reporters in Abuja, the nation’s capital, that the formation of the new union followed what he called the unbearable neglect and unfair, hostile treatment by the NUP on various issues. Ubani said the leaders of the new union decided to end what he called the countless unattended complaints of its members and decided that forming a new union was a way of pursuing peaceful coexistence with the NUP. The union leader said the NUP had failed to take care of “our welfare and interest and for lack of familiarity with our peculiar circumstances, we cannot be adequately represented by the NUP, which, in its operation, has never protected our interest, even though the NUP collects our monthly check-off dues in millions of naira”. He said members of the new union are drawn from the following sectors: Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), Power, Health, Education, Universities, Transportation, Aviation’s, Banking, Finance, Telecommunications, Judiciary and the private sectors. He said: “The emergence of this new pensioners’ association is predicated on the need to have an association that will squarely cater for the welfare and interests of all Federal parastatals pensioners, especially considering the fact that the existing Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) has in no small measure failed to take care of our welfare and interests, and for lack of familiarity with our peculiar circumstances, we cannot be adequately represented by NUP.
