R. Kelly is in a financial bind after his failure to pay child support and rent on his infamous studio. One of Kelly’s accounts was left in the red after $150,000 was seized. According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Wintrust Bank contacted one of the singer’s creditors to inform them of insufficient funds and balance of negative $13. The publication stated that Kelly does have two other accounts with Bank of America that holds a total of $154,527.22 combined. However, those accounts were seized by the former landlord, except $625. The former landlord was awarded a $173,000 judgment, and in turn, subpoenas were sent to Sony, ASCAP, and other accounts where the singer holds money. The landlord then received $154, 527.22 from Bank of America. But, according to reports, he still wants the remaining balance. As a result, the landlord has requested that the judge release the remaining balance to settle the debt.
