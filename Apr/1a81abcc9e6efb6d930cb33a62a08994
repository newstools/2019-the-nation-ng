The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has begun moves to check incessant buildings collapse  across the country by regulating weights and measurements of building materials. Its Director-General, Osita Aboloma, stated this at a workshop in Abuja on the importance of metrology for quality assurance of products, services and industrial development. He said some buildings collapsed because the measurements and weights of building materials used for it were not up to standard. According to him, when you have the wrong measurement, things would go wrong. He explained that sometimes builders under-use  rods or blocks. ‘’But when these are accurate, you are sure of what you are doing,” he said. Aboloma, who was represented by SON’s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Coordinator, Mr. Gambo Dimka, said architects, engineers and related professionals in the built environment, must ensure that the measurements given were  what they used. “If the architect says you should use four-by-five windows, don’t go to a quack who will construct less than what the architect specified,” he advised. “The SON Act No.14 of 2015 covers all aspects of metrology to ensure the protection of business, safety, wealth and every other aspect of Nigerians’ lives,” he said.
