THE Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board (CPWB) yesterday screened over 250 intending Jerusalem Pilgrims. The exercise was to ascertain their fitness for this year’s Easter pilgrimage and validate their traveling documents. The administrative/medical screening is a statutory prerequisite programme organised by CPWB to orientate intending pilgrims for the yearly exercise. CPWB Public Affairs Officer Olasimbo Uvieshe, in a statement, said the orientation and screening were designed to ensure that prospective pilgrims were equipped physically and psychologically. Addressing the prospective pilgrims at the Chapel of Christ, Alausa, Ikeja, CPWB Board Secretary Mrs. Yetunde Gbafe said the exercise had curbed absconding and unruly conduct by pilgrims. She said since the pilgrims would be travelling to another country, there was need to orientate them about the values, customs and behavioural expectation of the Israeli government during the pilgrimage. Gbafe advised the pilgrims to be good ambassadors of the state by ensuring that they comport themselves while there. The board Chairman, Bishop Olusola Ore, urged the prospective pilgrims not to see the visit as tourism, but a spiritual journey that should stir up spiritual rebirth. The board’s Assistant Director, Finance and Accounts, Dr. Olayinka Kilanko, assured the pilgrims that the government was working with the relevant agencies to ensure their safety during the exercise. An intending pilgrim,  Adebayo Michael, implored the government to put structures in place for the physically-challenged, who intended to visit the Holy Land.
