The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, has  commended the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu  over his comment on  budget padding in the 8th National Assembly. The group in a statement signed by the President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, also cautioned Igbo leaders against making divisive comments ca pable of destabilizing  the unity of the country and portraying the Igbo in bad light. “We commend the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu over his comments on the budget padding in the 8th Assembly.  There’s no need to cry over spilled milk. It should be a lesson for the new leadership that will  emerge in the 9th Assembly. Those crucifying Tinubu should be careful. “We also want to caution Igbo leaders to desist from making  unguarded comments capable of affecting the unity of Nigeria. We know President Buhari’s victory in the just concluded election has re tired some Igbo leaders from active politics. It ended some political dynasties in the South East, and threw up fresh opportunities for the youths. That is why those people are making disparaging comments.  We are watching those elders keenly and may have no option than to sanction them if they continue to use the name of Igbo nation to discredit the good works of the president  towards the Southeast. “We support that Senate President should go to North East and Speakership to South West or North Central. We only demand for the position of Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Deputy Senate Presi dent. We have eminent personalities qualified for both Jobs. We advise Our people in the House of Representatives to Support the decision of APC leadership. “We commend the South East governorselect, and hereby urge implore them to make youths to constitute over 50% of their cabinets and also urge them to ensure that the new salary structure is implemented at the state levels.”
