Executive chairman of Agege Local Government, Hon AbdulGaniyu Egunjobi, has thrown his weight behind the demand for local government autonomy in the country. He said that only council autonomy can guarantee genuine development of rural areas in the country. “In all honesty, it is high time the legislative arms across the country did what is right and grant the local governments the full autonomy they deserve. The local government is the closest to the grassroots and we cannot wish away this and the fact this current situation in which the finances of the councils are under the states are a disservice to developments in our communities. No doubt, the 1999 Constitution bequeathed to us this problem of partial autonomy. It recognises the local government as the third tier of government but restricts its independence. Constitution as we all know is a work in progress. “The 8th National Assembly has done its bit by passing the local government autonomy bill and President Muhammadu Buhari’s favourable disposition towards it is well documented; all it requires to change the narrative is for two-third of the state assemblies to endorse it. ‘’If it comes into force, grassroots will witness tremendous developments in the area of infrastructures and human capital developments and the whole country would be the better for it. The local government is the bedrock for sustainable development in nation building and this constitutional encumbrance is inimical to effective local government administration. Without fear of contradiction, there is no alternative to local government autonomy if we want to develop as a country. Local government is in fact, a safety net for struggling families in the grassroots. Egunjobi expressed optimism that the Lagos State House of Assembly would soon endorse the agitation for council autonomy. The council chief noted that divergent views expressed by different stakeholders would not in any way affect the agitation for local government autonomy.
