A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ayobo Ipaja Local Council Development Area, Otunba Ladi Oluwaloni Olo, has advised the academics to consider studying more about the political philosophy of the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The financial expert said the political sagacity of the APC leader should not be subjected to discussion only during his birthday, but rather, students of political science and history must learn more from him. He said Tinubu’s financial expertise should also be subjected to learning by leaders and managers of men and resources, especially how he developed and brought many professionals into politics. “We must also learn about how he increased the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Lagos State to an enviable status. Today in Lagos, we can talk of our capacity to raise the finance to cater for the state financially. It’s the financial ingenuity of one man and his team members.”
