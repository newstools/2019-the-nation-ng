Nigerian leaders, both political and religious, have been urged to use their esteemed positions in the community to bequeathe a legacy that would aid the development of the society during and after their life time. Throwing the challenge was an Islamic scholar and Chief Imam of Afanta Central Mosque, Oshogbo, Sheikh Abdul-Wahab Banni while delivering a lecture at this year’s grand finale of the Mouludi Nabiyyi of the Shababul Faydatul Ibrahimiyyah Society of Nigeria at Igbaye, Odo-Otin Local Government, Osun State. According to the cleric, the attitudes, behaviour and body languages of leaders must be the type that lead to positive attitudinal change. That, he said, would make the society better than they met it. “Posterity would only be kind to the political and religious leaders whose preaching and behaviours guarantee progress and development of the society,” Sheikh Banni said. Founder and Spiritual Leader of the organisation, Sheikh Muhammadu Mudathiru Sulayman Ciesse, said the theme of this year’s 35th anniversary event, tagged: “Igbaye 2019” was positive behavioural change for the progress of the community. According to him, if the leaders, who are to serve as role models, mentors and mirrors to the society lead with the fear of God, the society would graduate from good to better and best rather than moving from bad to worst. The event was attended by dignitaries from South Africa, United Kingdom, United State, Senegal, The Republic of Benin among other nations of the world.
