Nollywood actress/producer Omoni Oboli, who turned 41 on April 22, celebrated the day with classic dresses made by popular celeb designer, Tiannah’s Empire and Trish O. Couture. Flooding her timeline with pictures, the mother of three boys in one of her captioned pictures thanked her creator, saying she is one of the timeless queens, going by her outfit and accomplishment so far. “All I have to say is thank you Lord! Timeless queen, ageless queen,” she said. “I was born with a gift, the gift of agelessness. I’m not just a year older I’m also a year better and prettier.”
