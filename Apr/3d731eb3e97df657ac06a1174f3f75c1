 Former Chelsea coach Antonio Conte is willing to take over the reins at Inter Milan on the proviso they make him the highest paid manager in the Serie A. Conte, 49, is on the lookout for a new job after sitting out this season following his sacking by Chelsea in the summer. The Italian has been linked with several top clubs but Inter are stepping up their interest in the former Juventus and Italy manager. Inter president Steven Zhang has reportedly told general manager Beppe Marotta to bring Conte to the San Siro at all costs. However, Conte has doubts about returning to Italy after enjoying his two-year spell in England so is making hefty demands. Conte is demanding to be paid a £9million annual salary after tax which would make him the highest earner among his Serie A managerial rivals. If Inter give Conte what he wants then he would earn £2.5m more than Juventus’ Massimiliano Allegri, who is currently Serie A’s highest-paid manager. Inter will have to shell out £21.5m if they are to sack current boss Luciano Spalletti. Spalletti, whose current deal runs out in 2021, could lose his job despite his side being in third spot with seven games to go.  Despite their league position, Inter are 27 points behind league leaders Juventus. Conte who handled the Italian national team from 2014 to 2016 coached Juventus for two years just before taking over the national team. He has coached eight club sides with Chelsea as the only one outside Italy. While at Chelsea he became the first manager in history to win three consecutive Premier League Manager of the Month awards (October, November and December) in 201 On 12 May 2017, Conte’s Chelsea side defeated West Bromwich Albion 1–0 away, with a late goal from substitute Michy Batshuayi, and secured the points required to win the 2016–17 Premier League title with two matches to spare. On 19 May 2018, Conte led Chelsea to a 1–0 victory over Manchester United in the 2018 FA Cup Final.
