Contraception in professional terms is popularly known as family planning. Few events in medical practice invoke such a great  motion as family planning. Perhaps, nothing is as distressing and confusing to an individual when a pregnancy has to be terminated. By its very nature, notwithstanding the law, termination of pregnancy, as we shall see, is not a decent or even ethically convenient method of  childbearing control.  Nevertheless, it happens so often in Nigeria. In order not to undergo the dilemma and distress of termination of pregnancy, a most worthy alternative is to plan your family now. For  this reason, I will be dealing with the issue of contraception in the articles that follow. Family planning, to put it simply, is a procedure or method to control the number of children and or pregnancy that the family or couple can look after. The word “look after” will mean, from conception to when the child will reach adulthood at age 18, or if the child  remains in school till age of 21 or more, the reasonable care and attention that the family can give the child to become useful to himself/herself and the society. That is, the care and attention that the parents can give to the child to make him/her to be economically productive. After all, what is the point of having a child that is a burden to the parents and society? To fully understand the magnitude of the issue on Nigeria’s national scale, let me take some excerpts from my up-coming book: Beyond Fears: A Practical Information Guide on How to Live, Work and Do Business in Nigeria. Data crunching may not be to the taste of everyone.  However, you need the data in order to fully understand the magnitude of the issue. Nigeria ranks  amongst the top 10 most populated countries in the world. According to United Nations data as of 2018, Nigeria’s  population  stands as 195,875,000. By another estimate, by February of 2019, Nigeria’s population is about 198,924,841,  according to World Population Review. “The above accounts place Nigeria as the seventh most populous country in the world. The  population density is about 217/sqkm and a population growth rate of 2.6 per cent annually.  At the current rate, the current projections for 2050 are over 390 million total residents. At current estimate, you may wish to know that 51.9 per cent of the population is urban (104,282,822 people in 2019) with median age of 17.9 years. The fertility rate as at February 2019 is 5.67, according to World Meters population figures. Most of the population is a young population, with 42.54 per cent between the ages of 0–14. There is also a very high dependency ratio of the country at 88.2 dependents per 100 non-dependents, according to Wikipedia. “The proportion of children under the age of 15 in 2010 was 44.0 per cent; 53.2 per cent was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.7 per cent was 65 years or older. There are, according to estimates, about 1.04 males to every one female in the country. You should take note though that while women are slightly outnumbered by men, after the age of 65, the  population of women outnumber men. The life expectancy in Nigeria is, to put it mildly, pathetic: being unfortunately, the lowest in all of West Africa. The average life expectancy is around 54.5 years of age, according to WHO data; with men living an average of 53.7 years and women living an average of 55.4 years. “This very low numbers of life expectancies can be attributed to the fact that the country has many health issues. In terms of access to clean drinking water, 68.5 per cent of Nigerians have improved means of access while 31.5 per cent still struggle to get clean water. Similarly, when examining the access to sanitation facilities, only 29 per cent of the entire populace of Nigeria has access to improved sanitation as compared to the 71 per cent that are still struggling. The average number of years spent in school here in Nigeria is approximately nine years, with national literacy rate of 59.6 per cent.” While these figures represent a good economic potential, the infrastructure to support and tap the potentials are lacking. Further, the burden of looking after a new child is phenomenon. In my earlier article, I discussed the burden of abortions in Nigeria. Let me again, bring this to the fore: Illegal abortion rate is huge and goes on even without direct  involvement of qualified healthcare workers. In fact, according to Guttmacher Institute, “an estimated 1.25 million induced abortions occurred in Nigeria in 2012, equivalent to a rate of 33 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–49.  The estimated unintended  pregnancy rate was 59 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. Fifty-six per cent of unintended pregnancies were resolved by abortion. About 212,000 women were treated for complications of unsafe  abortion, representing a treatment rate of 5.6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age, and an additional 285,000 experienced serious health consequences but did not receive the treatment they needed.” If you need support on what I have discussed here, you may call  08188343865 for assistance.
