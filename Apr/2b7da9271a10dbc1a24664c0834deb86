Pension remittances of N33 billion continued to be the subject of contention on Tuesday at the continued sitting of the House of Representatives’ Ad Hoc Committee Investigating the activities of the National Pension Commission and violation of the PenCom Act. The knotty question the committee was trying to unravel was what happened to six months remittances from the PenCom While Pencom stated that it has no outstanding in terms of remittances to Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs) and Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs). But the lawmakers were not happy with PenCom and accused the body of reluctance to avail the House Committee of the statement of its accounts with the apex bank. Chairman of the committee Hon. Johnson Agbonayinma, said: “We have written several letters…’submit your bank statement and all stransactions with CBN.’ Up till now, no response. Every request that we have made, they are just manoeuvring. “Is there anything else you want us to do to get your attention to submit it? Look at the CBN, everything we requested they have submitted. Also the Accountant-General’s office, everything we requested for have been submitted. “
