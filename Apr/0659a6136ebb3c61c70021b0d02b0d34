The All Progressives Congress (APC) and elected members of the House of Representatives in Niger State have dashed the hope of the member representing Chachanga Constituency, Mohammed Bago, to become the Speaker. At a meeting on Monday evening by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, the state APC said it was supporting Femi Gbajabiamila as Speaker of the House of Representatives and Ahmed Lawan as Senate President. Bago is one of the key contenders for the speakership position of the Ninth House of Representatives. Niger State’s APC Chairman Jibril Imam said the state decided to follow the stance of the party and its national leadership on who emerge leaders of the Ninth Assembly. “Going by what happened during the Eighth National Assembly, the party, at all levels, decided to reach a middle ground to enable us present a formidable front on the matter,” he said. Imam said the meeting was a follow-up to an earlier one in Abuja by the party’s state chairmen and governors from the Northcentral states. The chairman said the Minna meeting was attended by serving and elected members from the state who unanimously adopted the two candidates. He added that the endorsement was to avert the reoccurrence of what happened in the Eighth Assembly, which slowed down national progress in the last four years. “We are loyal party members and have resolved to toe the position of the party by endorsing Senator Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan as the Senate President of the Ninth Assembly and Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the Ninth Assembly. “Our experience in the Eighth Assembly is not palatable and it has slowed down our progress in the last four years. We don’t want a repeat of that,” Imam said. On behalf of the elected members of the House of Representatives in Niger State, Abdullahi Mahmud, representing Agaie/Lapai Constituency, said the adoption of the duo was an affirmation of party supremacy.
