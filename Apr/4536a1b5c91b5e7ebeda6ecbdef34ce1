A Yaba Magistrates’ Court has sentenced  Emmanuel Obinna, 20, to one year imprisonment for stealing a phone,  a wristwatch and N13, 000 cash from other guests at a hotel. Magistrate Oluwatoyin Ojuromi sentenced the convict without an option of fine after he pleaded guilty to the three-count charge of stealing. “Having considered the facts of this case and that the defendant did not waste the time of this court, also a first time offender, I hereby sentence him to one year imprisonment. “Let it serve as a deterrent to those with similar intentions to commit such offence in future,” she said. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Oriabure told the court that the defendant, at about 7pm, on February 19, stole items from other guests at Villas Hotel, Akowonjo Street, Egbeda, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant, who claimed to be celebrating his birthday at the hotel, stole the items from lodgers. Oriabure added that the defendant stole an Itel phone valued at N58,000, a Bluetooth wristwatch worth N43,000 and N13,000 cash from Miss Halima Kabiru and Mr Adebayo Olawale. He alleged that the defendant also bought drinks worth N11,000, but refused to pay. “My Lord, he ran away from the hotel, but it was the guard who chased and arrested him.”
