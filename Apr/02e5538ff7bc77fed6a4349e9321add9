Determined to co-opt more youths to actively participate in the state’s burgeoning tech space, Governor Godwin Obaseki’s skills development platform, EdoJobs has partnered with SLOT Foundation to train youths in Esan West Local Government Area of the state on GSM and laptop maintenance. Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Job Creation and Skills Development, Mrs Ukinebo Dare, in a chat with journalists at the weekend, said that the training programme is coming after the impressive showing of the last batch of trainees. She said that the state government is committed to empowering youths and equipping them with in-demand skills for increased productivity, so they can meaningfully contribute to the state’s economy. According to her, “We will be partnering with SLOT Foundation for the training of youths in Esan West LGA. The training would last for three months. Of the three months, one would be for formal training while the other two will be for intensive practical. “They would be taken through the rudiments and would develop expertise in phone and laptop repairs, a skill-set that is widely sought after with the expansion of the tech ecosystem in Nigeria. The trainees will get the opportunity to work with a Slot franchise or go the entrepreneurial route. This would afford them the opportunity to eke out a decent living.” She added that the state government is keen on adding more jobs to the over 77000 created in the last two years, noting that EdoJobs role is to work with partners to create a conducive environment for skills development. She noted, “At EdoJobs we are confident about meeting the governor’s target of creating 200000 jobs before the end of his first tenure. We have been training people across the state in the past two years. This training at Esan West is to ensure that youths across the state get equal opportunity to lead a better life.”
