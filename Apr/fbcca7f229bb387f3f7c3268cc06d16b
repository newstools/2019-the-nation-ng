The police in Lagos have arrested two men, Friday Emmanuel, 21, and Obiora Nwabueze, 29, for allegedly stealing female panties. The suspects were arrested by operatives of Satellite Division on April 20, under the Mile Two Bridge while fighting. It was gathered that a fight had broken between the men after Nwabueze failed to pay Emmanuel N30, 000 agreed upon for him to steal the pant. According to a statement by spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), when Emmanuel brought the pants, instead of paying him the agreed amount, Nwabueze attempted to take them by force and that caused a fight. “During interrogation, Emmanuel regretted listening to his friend Nwabueze, who was pestering him to get him female underwears he desperately needed to become rich. “Both suspects were Wednesday charged to Magistrate Court 23, at Mbah Road, Ajegunle, Lagos for conspiracy and stealing,” he said.
