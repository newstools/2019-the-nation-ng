Anambra state government on Saturday said plans has been concluded to ensure minimum of 15-hours daily electricity supply to Awka, the state capital and environs. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Public Utilities, Mr. Victor Meju made the disclosure to newsmen in his office in Awka. He said government had extended support to the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) to facilitate installation of adequate transformers in many communities across the state to improve power supply. He said, “With the support of the state Ministry of Public Utilities, EEDC is currently installing a 15 Mega Voltage Amp (MVA) in Agu-Awka. “Another 17.5 MVA is being installed at the Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS), Awka to drastically improve electricity supply in areas like Government House, Ifite Awka, Okpuno, Nodu, Isuanocha, Agu-Awka, among others.” Meju however hinted that government would also extend help to other towns in the state to make the entire Anambra an envy of all.
