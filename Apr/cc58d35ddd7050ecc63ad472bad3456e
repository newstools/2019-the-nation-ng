A Federal High Court sitting in Kano on Thursday disqualified AbdulRahman Kawu Sumaila as the elected representative of Sumaila/Takai federal constituency of Kano at the National Assembly. Shamsudeen Dambazau of the APC had sued INEC, APC and AbdulRahman Kawu  Sumaila challenging the recognition of AbdulRahman Kawu  Sumaila  as the APC House of Representatives candidate for Sumaila/Takai federal constituency. The presiding judge, Justice Lewis Allagoa ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued Sumaila, ruling he was not the duly elected as a member of the House of Representatives member for Sumaila/Takai federal constituency. The court declared he did not participate in the primary election. The plaintiff in the suit, Shamsudeen Dambazau had approached the court, praying the nullification of Sumaila’s recognition by INEC as duly elected as he never participated in the primary election of the party. He told the court through his Counsel, Barrister Nuraini Jimoh that AbdulRahman Kawu  Sumaila contested for Kano South Senatorial seat  at primary with Kabiru Gaya and lost the race. Justice Lewis Allagoa also ordered INEC to recognise Shamsudeen Dambazau as the duly elected House of Representative member representing for Sumaila/Takai federal constituency. Sumaila, who was represented by his Counsel, Barrister Muhammad Auwal Tofa declined to comment with journalists. However, Kawu popularly called Kawu Sumaila was the SSA to President Buhari on National Assembly House of Representatives Matters from 27 August 2015. He later resigned few months to 2019 general elections to contest for the contested federal constituency slot.
