Lagos State Public Procurement Agency (LSPPA) has introduced the Vendor Registration Module (VRM)  for migration to its e-Procurement platform. The VRM was adopted on April 10. Its General Manager, Mr. Fatai Idowu Onafowote, said yesterday that the e-procurement platform would deepen the implementation, workability and effectiveness of procurement process in order to improve the ease of doing business. It will also make it easier for stakeholders to transact businesses with the government from their offices and homes. He said: “In addition, the agency’s migration seeks to entrench the core values of public procurement, that is, probity, accountability, transparency, competitiveness, value-for-money and fairness in the execution of government projects and programmes. “To this end, the LSPPA is desirous of delivering an excellent and efficient service to stakeholders in line with international best practices and the government’s vision of a smart city. “The agency hereby encourages stakeholders to key into the new module, which is aimed at improving service delivery. “It enjoins the public to visit its website – www.lagosppa.gov.ng, click on contractors registration and follow the necessary simplified and customer-friendly steps to register. “The e-Procurement Vendor Registration Module is in compliance with the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency (PPA) Law Chapter 56, Volume 6, Law of Lagos State 2015 and Guideline on the implementation of procurement process in Lagos State.”
