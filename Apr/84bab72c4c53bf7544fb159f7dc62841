Africa’s largest e-commerce companies, Jumia Technologies, said it remains an African firm, adding that the continent is endowed with a large pool of talented young software developers. This followed speculation that the e-commerce company is not for Africa, after Jumia officially announced its listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) last Friday. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Jumia Nigeria, Ernest Eguasa who spoke with reporters in Lagos, said every impact the e-commerce company is trying to make is not for Asia or Europe but for Africa. “Jumia is an African company. Our customers are Africans and I can assure you that everything we do is for the benefit of Africans and Africans alone. We educate our vendors to make money, including seminars too. Also, the workers are Africans here and in the other African 13 countries and will never go anywhere else. Jumia has invested heavily in tackling major infrastructure challenges including investing in logistics and delivery. It has also developed a proprietary online payments technology.
