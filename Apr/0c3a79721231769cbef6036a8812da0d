THE police are ready to tackle bandits in Zamfara State with the inauguration of operation “Puff Adder”, the Inspector General of Police Muhammed Adamu said yesterday. Adamu, who spoke during the inauguration in  Gusau, said the bandits  have scampered to neighbouring states, especially to Sokoto State, with the ongoing robust combined operations in Zamfara State, which was becoming the centre of banditry in the Northwest. The IG, who was represented by AIG Zone 10, Muhammad Mustapha, added that achievements have been realised in curtailing banditry activities from the time the operation was inaugurated in Kaduna on Friday, April 5. He warned that the achievements could not be sustained without cooperation, information, intelligence report, prayers and support from the affected communities. Adamu added that there are over 500 policemen at the inauguration and more would be coming to support the security personnel that are expediting actions against the bandits. He warned his officers and men that for the police to succeed in their assignments, they must abide by the rules of engagement and they must be professionals in the discharge of their duties. Governor Abdul Aziz Yari, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Abdullahi Muhammad Shinkafi, stressed that the operation initiated by the IG clearly shows that he meant business. He added that as the crooks are inventing new ways to perpetrate heinous crime, there was a need to create and adopt new strategies to tackle their nefarious activities. Yari lamented that the bandits were hitherto attacking villages and abducting people on the highway without notice, hence the need to introduce such an operation.
