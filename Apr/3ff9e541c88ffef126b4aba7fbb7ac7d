The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC in Anambra State, has a new Chairman in the person of Comrade Jerry Nnubia. He was unanimously elected at the weekend in Awka ,during the NLC’s delegate conference,  where he cautioned some Governors on the implementation of the new minimum wage . Nnubia, called on the Governors in the country to cut down on their spending  to enable them pay the new minimum wage, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari recently He said he prayed that some of the Governors would not do anything capable of causing unrest among the workers going by their body language on the new minimum wage. Nnubia said full implementation of the 30,000 naira minimum across the country would ensure stability in the polity. According to the labour leader, “The minimum wage is a product of negotiation and with the President signing it into law, we are looking out for a circular to be released and each state is bound to implement it” “The state governments have no option than to implement it because they were part and parcel of all the negotiations” “For us in Anambra State, we have the firm belief that our governor will implement it fully. He has promised us and I am sure we are not going to have challenges in that regard” “We commend the national assembly for the speedy passage of the new national minimum wage (2019) amendment bill and also President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to it on April 18, 2019″ “We therefore wish to use this platform to call on the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission, NSIWC, to immediately issue out the implementation table to enable our hardworking and labour friendly governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who has already firmly promised to be the first governor to pay the new minimum wage for the hardworking workers of Anambra State, implement the new minimum wage.” Furthermore, he spoke on the agitations on labour issues that led to the setting up of a committee headed by the state deputy governor, Dr. Nkem Okeke. He regretted that although the committee had since concluded its assignment and submitted its report to the governor, no action had been taken to date.
