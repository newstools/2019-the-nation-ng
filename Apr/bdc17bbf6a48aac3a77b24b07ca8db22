The chewing stick of the old woman was beside her remains.  It was learnt that neighbours woke up to see her lifeless body. One of the deceased’s daughters who is a council official, was seen crying and lamenting the gruesome murder of her mother.   She urged security agents to thoroughly investigation and unravel the mystery surrounding her mother’s death.
