Team Nigeria will take on Mauritius today in the final of the Mixed Team Championships at the All Africa Senior Badminton championships in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. In the semi-final played yesterday, the Nigerian team defeated South Africa 3-0, while Mauritius beat Egypt by the same scoreline to set up a final clash with the host. The Nigerian team is yet to drop a game and today’s encounter will present the greatest challenge for the host who are hoping for a clean sweep of the medals. Assistant Coach, George Shitta after the victory, stated that the game against Mauritius would be a tight one, but predicted a good outing for his players. “It is going to be a tough game. Mauritius is rated the best in Africa so we have to play well to dethrone them. “The Nigerian team is yet to drop any game and I am sure that they will carry that form to the final against the favourites, Mauritius. If we get our acts together, we will surely win gold. The players also know the enormity of the task ahead and I am sure they will rise up to the challenge,” Shitta added. The final game will come up today’s evening, while the singles event will hold from Friday to Sunday when the championship will be declared closed.
