Super Eagles’ striker, Odion Ighalo scored the first goal to help Shanghai Shenhua secure a 2-1 over Henan Jianye in a Chinese Super League game played yesterday at the Zhengzhou Hanghai Stadium. Just back from international duties where his seven goals ensured Nigeria clinched top spot in the AFCON qualifiers, the ex-Watford forward was handed a starting shirt by manager, Quique Sanchez Flores and he justified that inclusion by putting his team ahead in the 52nd minute after the first half ended goalless. The Nigerian International buried a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner after teammate Wang Wei had set him up. Ighalo nearly grabbed his brace in the 76th minute when his speculative shot narrowly went wide of the left side of goal. That goal was his second for the club since joining last month, having played three games for  the Hongkou Stadium outfit in the topflight.The victory placed Shanghai Shenhua on the tenth position in the league’s latest standings  ahead their next game on April 7 at home against Beijing Renhe.
