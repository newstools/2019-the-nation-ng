Residents of Ogun State have been urged to plant trees in their compounds to beautify the environment and mitigate the effects of global warming. A Director in the State Ministry of Forestry, Dolapo Odulana, made the call at a rally for schools and selected areas in Abeokuta metropolis, to mark the International Day of Forestry. He said the purpose of the rally was to sensitise people on the benefits of forest preservation and the need to prevent indiscriminate felling of trees. Speaking on this year’s theme, ‘’Forest and education’’, Odulana cautioned that deforestation would have a devastating impact on the people, as trees help to mitigate harsh environ-mental condition. “The forest is no doubt a veritable tool to mitigate the challenges of the environment and this is why we encourage everybody to raise at least a tree,’’ he said. If you and I would raise a tree, it will make a big difference in the environment”, he said. Places visited included: Ita-Oshin, Panseke, Itoku, as well as Abeokuta Grammar School, Egba.
