Rev. Istifanus Koce, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Good News Church, Kuje, has called on Christians to have genuine faith in God’s ability to achieve divine intervention through Christ Jesus. Koce gave the admonition in his message at ECWA Good News Church, AA2 in Kuje, FCT, on Sunday. According to him, having Faith in God, allows Christians to accommodate one another in times of crisis and social unrest for God’s intervention. He said that the sacrifice made by Christ “is worthy of emulation”, therefore, Christians should follow His footsteps through faith, love, unity, tolerance, forgiveness and sacrifice. “Therefore faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. “By faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible, according to Hebrew 11:3. “As Christians, faith allows us to tolerate one another, especially in a society where their is unrest and social conflict. “We should have faith in God and live a sacrificial life just as Jesus Christ laid down His life on the Cross for us,” he said. Koce read the book of  Hebrew Chapter 11: 1 – 38, to remind Christians of how Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain through which he obtained witness that he was righteous. The passage also revealed how through Faith, the Israelite’s passed through the Red sea on dry land, whereas the Egyptians attempted to do so were drowned. He said that Christians must adhere to the commandments of God, while reflecting on the virtues of Christ by having faith in God. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Sunday service featured scriptural reading, song ministrations and communion service. NAN
