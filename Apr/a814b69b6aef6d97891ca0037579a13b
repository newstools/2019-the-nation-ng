Arsenal suffered a third successive defeat in the Premier League as they lost 3-0 at Leicester after seeing Ainsley Maitland-Niles red carded on 36 minutes. Goals from Youri Tielemans and a late Jaime Vardy double gave the home side the win after a dominant performance against Unai Emery’s side. The contest was fairly even until Maitland-Niles’ early sending-off for two yellow cards, and then Leicester took control — with Jamie Vardy coming closest to opening the scoring. But the breakthrough did eventually come on 59 minutes when James Maddison’s cross found Tielemans, who headed past Bernd Leno. And the German goalkeeper was on hand to make several top-class saves in order to keep his team in it as Leicester dominated. Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell both saw efforts parried, while Maddison curled a delightful effort just wide. With five minutes remaining, Vardy ran onto a long ball from Kasper Schmeichel over the top of the Arsenal defence and having seen his effort initially come off the bar, was on hand to head in the rebound. And, with the last kick of the match, he tapped in from close range after being teed up by Ricardo Pereira. Leicester, who have beaten Manchester City and Chelsea and earned a draw at Liverpool, registered their first victory over a top six side since Brendan Rodgers took over as manager in February and remain on course for seventh. Arsenal,  meanwhile stay fifth and will finish the weekend outside the top four. ESPN
