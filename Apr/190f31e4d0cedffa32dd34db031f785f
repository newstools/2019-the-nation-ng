Super Eagles are now set to take on fellow 2019 AFCON qualifiers Benin in a warm-up game in June after a proposed friendly with Ghana was called off. It was first reported that a proposed with the Black Stars was never going to come off because Ghana have already arranged a training camp in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the AFCON around the same time. Officials have now informed SCORENIGERIA that efforts are now geared for the Eagles to face Benin Republic in Asaba in the first week of June before they head out to Egypt for the AFCON. The Eagles will also battle Senegal in Egypt as part of their build-up for the 2019 AFCON. Last month they beat AFCON hosts Egypt 1-0 in a friendly in Asaba.
