The Ibadan zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Friday secured the convictions of Oyinloye Jubril and Bamidele Adegboyega before Justice P. I. Ajoku of the Federal High Court 1, Ibadan. Oyinloye was earlier arraigned on March 7, 2019 on a four-court charge bordering on attempt to commit offence under the Advance Fee Fraud Act and obtaining by false pretence, contrary to Section 1(3) of the Advanced Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006. Bamidele’s initial three-count charge when he was arraigned on March 1, 2019 borders on possession of fraudulent document. The duo pleaded not guilty to the initial charges. But before the adjourned date for trial, they approached the prosecution for a plea and sentence bargain. Consequent upon the plea bargain agreement, their earlier charges were amended and the convicts re-arraigned on one count charge each of Fraudulent Impersonation, contrary to Section 22 (3)(a) and punishable under Section 22 (4) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention Etc) Act, 2015. They both pleaded guilty to the amended charges. Adeola Elumaro and Mabas Mabur, prosecution counsel in Oyinloye’s and Bamidele’s respective cases, prayed the court to convict them based on the plea bargain agreements. Justice Ajoku while considering the terms of the bargain, convicted and sentenced them to four months imprisonment with effect from their days of arrest. The court also ordered that Oyinloye forfeits to the Federal Government his Honda Accord car, one Techno Phone, One Aitel Phone, One HP Laptop, $1, 250 USD being assets recovered from him in the  course of his investigation. Bamidele was, however, ordered to restitute to his victim through Federal Government the sum of $200 USD, one Techno Phone and one Dell Laptop being part of the benefit he derived from his fraudulent act.
