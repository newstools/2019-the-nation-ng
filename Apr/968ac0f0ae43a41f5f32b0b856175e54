Nigerian-born sprinter, Divine Oduduru says he worked very hard before producing a world-leading performance at the Michael Johnson invitational meet in Waco Texas, USA, last weekend. NationSport reports that the 22-year-old became the first Nigerian to break the sub 10s barrier in almost 13 years by setting a new world fastest time in the 100m race with a time of 9.94 seconds in his first attempt and later rounded off with a time of 9.94s to win the event. The Texas Tech sprinter also finished strong in the 200m after running a time of 19.76 which was declared a new national record by the Athletics Federation of Nigeria as it beats Francis Obikwelu’s 19.84 time set in 1999 at the World Championships in Seville Spain. Just 122 sprinters in history have broken the 10-second barrier in the 100m, and only 72 sprinters have gone sub-20 in the 200m. “I worked for this. My coaches have always been telling me that I have to get into the moment where I can feel everything. “I want to say thank you to Coach [Calvin] Robinson for getting me to this point in my life and my career. We have a great team, and I want to say thank you to everyone for their love and support. “It’s something we do in practice. We run, time the rest, then come back and run another race. He [Robinson] said to just run it the way I do in practice,” Oduduru said after the race.
