Regarded as the most credible sport awards in the country, organisers said the Nigeria Pitch Awards have come to stay despite lack of sponsorship since its inception. This much was said by Shina Philips, President of the Nigeria Pitch Awards at the unveiling of its nominees for  the 6th edition of the awards even as he expresses gratitude of the organizers and award partners to all sport journalists, the Nigeria Football Federation and SIAO Partners for their support for since 2013. “ We want to remain resolute in our commitment to sustain the Nigeria Pitch Awards,” noted  the CEO Matchmakers Consult .“In spite of the harsh economic situation and the increasing difficulty in convincing sponsors because of the  current state of the economy, we will continue to turn up each year to provide platform for the reward of excellence in our football. ” We are confident that the future will become brighter and our football will be better for it.” Philips further stated that organizers were working on a plan to overhaul the organization specifically with a view to reducing the number of categories. ”We are planning a major reorganization with respect to the number of categories we have. By next edition, we will certainly have fewer categories. We believe this will make it easier for our voters to complete their votes.” Nneka Eneli, Head of Corporate Services who represented Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, the Managing Partner of SIAO Partners said the shortlist of potential winners was drawn from the votes cast by sport journalists across the country between February and March 2019. “Voting for the 6th edition of the awards took place between 1st February and 1st March 2019.  We assure all voters of the Nigeria Pitch Awards that their votes have been adequately captured and the results you will get today are the wishes of all who voted. Let me stress again that the entire process was professionally handled by our team of accountants and auditors without any form of interference from the organizers or sponsors,” Eneli said.
