For his exceptional display coupled with his good conduct at the World Junior Circuit (WJC) and African Junior and Cadet Championships (AJCC) in Accra, Ghana, Nigeria’s Taiwo Matti has been invited to the High Performance Training Camp for U-15 and U-18 players across the world in Bangkok, Thailand on May 6 to 13.  In a letter signed by ITTF High Performance & Development Operations Manager, Dora Jeler, Matti’s invitation was based on the recommendation of the High Performance Manager, Massimo Costantini, who was in Accra for the tournaments.  “In our second round of invitations, ITTF High Performance & Development is pleased to invite Mati Taiwo (NGR) to our High Performance Training Camp for U15 & U18 players, to be held in Bangkok, Thailand from 6-13 May 2019. The camp will be held prior to and in preparation of the ITTF World Junior Circuit Thailand Junior & Cadet Open in Bangkok, so that players and coaches wishing to attend both the camp and the tournament will be able to connect the two,” Jeler said.  The training would be handled by top coaches including the High Performance Manager, Massimo Costantini, who is ITTF Coach of the Year.  Matti was outstanding for Nigeria at the just concluded World Junior Circuit (WJC) and ITTF African Junior and Cadet Championship held in Accra, Ghana and he emerged as the cadet champion in the two events.  He was also instrumental to Nigeria’s triumph over Egypt in the boys’ U-21 team event and their emergence as the new champion in the continent. The Ondo State-born star was one of the stars that ignited the tournaments in Ghana with his beautiful and outstanding display particularly against the highly-rated Egyptian players.
