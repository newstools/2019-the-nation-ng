Akwa Ibom State governor, Udom Emmanuel, has appealed to his opponents to set aside their political differences in the spirit of Easter and join hands with him to uplift the state. Emmanuel, who made the plea during his Easter broadcast to the state yesterday, urged those who contested the governorship election against him to accept the result as the will of God and Akwa Ibom people. He said the wellbeing and future of the people should supercede any partisan interest, adding that the Easter season epitomises love and sacrifice which politicians must display in the interest of the state. He said: ”I am again inviting my brothers and sisters on the opposite side of the political divide to join hands with me to build a prosperous, safe and secure state where our people will continue to rise and claim the faith of their greatness. ”This should be no time for mutual recriminations.  Let us show that politics can and must be more ennobling than how certain people may make it appear. ”Let us begin to build a new vista of understanding of what political contest is all about: that a winner must emerge and the loser must not be treated with contempt or derision. ”I remain dedicated to promoting and projecting this beautiful virtue: politics that is played without bitterness as the Second Republic politician, the late Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim had preached. ”Today, I urge you again to celebrate all that is good and ennobling in us. We are a great people of a great heritage, and we must stand ready to work together to ensure and sustain a great future for ourselves and our children.” The governor thanked the people of the state for giving him another opportunity to serve, promising to improve on all sectors in his second term.
