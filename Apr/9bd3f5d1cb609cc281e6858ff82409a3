THE Registrar of Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, Prof. Segun Ajiboye, said yesterday that the council is now bringing back to the classrooms teachers, who have deserted the Northeast zone due to terrorism and insurgencies. He said the plan is to motivate and change the psyche of the traumatised teachers to return to school. Ajiboye, who spoke with reporters in Ibadan, said some of the teachers lost their certificates to terrorism, but have been restored by the intervention of the council. According the TRCN, bringing back the teachers would improve knowledge transmission to students in the Northeast. He said “Actually, it is disheartening we are affected and we can’t pretend. We have lost so many teachers to insecurity, especially in the Northeast. It created trauma. Pupils left the schools. They don’t want to come. The teachers themselves left because of what has happened to their colleagues. “What we are doing is to bring back our teachers, especially in the Northeast. A lot of interventions are going on to motivate the teachers and change their psyche. “So, many of them left the teaching profession and they don’t want to come back. But now, sanity is returning and our teachers are coming back. Some of them lost their certificates to insurgency.” On the deadline to register as professional teachers, Ajiboye stated that full enforcement against unregistered and unlicensed teachers would begin in January 2020. The TRCN boss said any teacher not registered by the council by December 31, 2019, will not be allowed to practice anymore in Nigeria. According to him, a letter of reminder is being written to Commissioners of Education and the Education Secretary in the Federal Capital Territory on the need to ensure that practising teachers in their states get valid licence before the deadline.
