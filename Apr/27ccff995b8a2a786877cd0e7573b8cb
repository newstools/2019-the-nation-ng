Edo State Government has said it would pay the new minimum wage of N30, 000 just signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. It said it has been paying N25,000 minimum wage before the increment. Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, confirmed in the affirmative that the new minimum wage would be paid to Edo workers. Osagie was however silent on when the state government would commence payment. He said the state government is labour friendly.
