As part of measures to tackle armed bandits and other violent criminal elements currently terrorizing Katsina state, the state government on Wednesday donated 12 vehicles to the Nigeria Police Force. The Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu who said the present security challenges could be won, directed the men of the Police Special Forces and other Tactical Units currently deployed in Katsina State to deal decisively with those terrorizing innocent citizens in the State. The Force Spokesman, DCP Frank Mba in statement in Abuja said the IGP gave the charge on Wednesday while addressing the combined Teams of Police Operatives at the Katsina Police Command Headquarters in continuation of his operational tour of the North Central and North Western States. The IGP while admitting the obvious security challenges facing the nation at different fronts, insisted that the security challenges are not insurmountable. He also assured that everything humanly and operationally possible is being done towards bringing a permanent end to incidences of armed banditry and other crimes in the country. The IGP had earlier paid a courtesy call on Katsina Governor, Aminu Masari, where he sought his support in the renewed fight against criminal elements. Responding, Masari who was represented by his Deputy, Alh. Mannir Yakubu, pledged full support of the State Government and the Citizens to ‘Operation Puff Adder’ and other security initiatives of the Nigeria Police Force. The Operation also got a boost in its operational asset as the State Government made a donation of 12 Toyota Hilux vans to the Police in the aid of the mission. Mba also stated that the IGP also visited the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Usman, where he sought his cooperation and other traditional authorities in the fight against criminals.
