Former Vice-President Namadi Sambo has said Nigeria needs more private universities to cater for its increasing population seeking tertiary education. Sambo urged stakeholders in the education sector and well-meaning Nigerians to take advantage of the enabling environment created by the Federal Government to invest in private universities. The former Vice-President spoke after he was inaugurated the Chairman of the Governing Board of Baze University, a private institution in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. According to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are 303 applications before it jostling to get provisional license to begin operation. Sambo said that only myopic people go abroad in search of tertiary education when all the enabling environment was being created at home by the government. The former VP said: “The population of this country is huge and it is encouraging to see that there are constantly new universities being established. “So, I believe that objective to have proper number of universities that will support the number of students we have in this country.” He also noted that investment in tertiary education goes beyond financial and human capital, saying the enabling environment was equally key. “I believe the present administration is doing its best to encourage private sector investment in education which is good,” he added. Founder of the university, Senator Datti Baba-Ahmed said at the inauguration ceremony that the appointment of the board was a major milestone that will boost education, not only for Baze University, but the entire country.
