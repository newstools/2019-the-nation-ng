Senator Magnus Abe (Rivers South East) has said his 2019 governorship ambition in Rivers State has ended. The declaration followed last week’s Supreme Court judgment on the governorship candidacy of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Abe, who noted that court pronouncement has killed factions in the party, called on members to unite to move the party forward. The senator, who spoke yesterday at a stakeholders meeting in Port Harcourt, noted that by the development, the APC’s dreams for elective political positions in 2019 has been laid to rest. He, however, restated his determination to rebuild the party, and called on members to join hands together to achieve the dream. Abe said: “With last week’s pronouncement on our candidacy matter, I have ended my ambition for 2019 here in Rivers. This time again, the court upheld the Rivers State High Court judgment of Justice Chiwendu Wogu, which authenticates the leadership of Peter Odike as the current APC state chairman. “We have come to fight for representation in government; every human being should be treated with respect. We have sacrificed so much; we may not be holding anything now but because of what we have done, politics will be better in our country. “We need to be realistic so that we can move forward. The dream that we have in the state is laid to rest, because of the pronouncement of the Supreme Court of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in our suit before it. “We know that the Supreme Court is infallible. Its pronouncement ended our agitation. But God knows the reason, He who knows what we do not know.” Senator Abe also advised the National leadership of APC to stop inciting problems that will keep dividing the party. “The party’s national leadership should stop doing things that will put the party and state in chaos. It should instead recognise the leadership of Odike at the state level.”
