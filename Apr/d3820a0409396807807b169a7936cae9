The project is one of the 13 ecological projects approved by Buhari for the Fourth Quarter, 2017. President Muhammadu Buhari said at the inauguration and handing over of Ote River Channelisation, Erosion Control and Access Road  in Osin Ekiti executed by the FG through Ecological Fund Office that the project was geared towards improving the welfare of Nigerians at the grassroot. Buhari, who was represented by Senator Ajayi Borofice said the wastefulness that erstwhile characterised Ecological Fund had been crushed by his administration. He added the project was clear demonstration of his commitment to the development and bringing the presence of the Federal Government to the rural areas. “I have been familiar with the Ecological Fund since when I was in the public service and I know how it is being administered. You can hardly find any tangible project being done by the Ecological Fund, but since the Buhari administration took off, the Ecological Fund is now being used for the people. “This project is expected to check flooding and erosion menace in the communities around its environs. “The age-long problem of gully erosion and flooding in this part of the country cannot be overemphasized. I have no doubt the Federal Government intervention programme will bring a huge relief to communities which had for a very long time been stressed by these ecological challenges. “With this project, the living standards of the people in the communities within its environs would be enhanced. This would at the same time reduce dangers to lives and properties associated with erosion and persistent flooding that had been experienced in recent times,” Borrofice said. The Olosin of Osin Ekiti, Oba Eniayewo Oyediran and the President of Osin Progressive Union, Elder Patrick Olayemi, expressed appreciation to the Federal Government for considering the town for the project, promising to take good care of the project for sustainability.
