The Nigerian Air Force on Sunday said more than 25 bandits have been killed in Zamfara state after it launched air strikes on their hideouts at the weekend. The spokesman of the Air Force, Air commodore Ibikunle Daramola said in a statement that the strikes were carried out after intelligence platforms have established the presence of the bandits in the areas. He added that the structures and logistics base of the bandits were also destroyed during the operations. Air Commodore Daramola said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) for Operation DIRAN MIKIYA has successfully destroyed an armed bandits’ logistics base at Ajia and neutralized dozens of armed bandits at Ajia and Wonaka in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area (LGA) of Zamfara State. “The operation was executed on 4 April 2019 sequel to Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports indicating that the armed bandits were using a compound within Ajia as a logistics store to support their operations. “Consequently, the ATF dispatched a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet, supported by an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, to attack the compound scoring accurate strikes on the target and causing it to erupt into flames, which engulfed the structures and resulted in the neutralization of some of the bandits. “Few survivors, seen fleeing the vicinity of the target area, were taken out in follow-on attacks while others, who managed to escape the area, were tracked to Wonaka and equally neutralised. “Independent HUMINT sources subsequently confirmed that more than 25 armed bandits were neutralized in the attacks on the 2 locations. “The NAF, working in close coordination with sister Services and other security agencies, will sustain its operations to neutralize the armed bandits and deny them freedom of action in the Northwest.”
