A 46-year-old man has been remanded in prison custody in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, for allegedly murdering his wife in the heat of a quarrel over the victim’s demand for sex. A chief magistrate ordered the remanded of the suspect, Ifeanyi Nwokolo, after he reportedly killed his wife, Ijeoma Nwokolo on April 6, because she demanded for sexual pleasure on the fateful while he was preparing for church vigil. It was gathered that the couple had lived Rumuigbo area of the city before the fateful, when they fought over the wife’s demand that the man made love to her before leaving the house. “We learnt that they had misunderstanding because Mrs. Ijeoma Nwokolo asked her husband to have sex with her on the fateful day, but the man was uncooperative because he said he had to attend church vigil service and could not indulge in the act. “In the course of the argument, the husband pushed the woman away but he must had pushed her too hard, as she fell and hit her head on the concrete wall in their bathroom,” a usually reliable police source told our reporter. Those familiar with the case said when the women fell, the man thinking that his wife was feigning injury, carried and laid her on the bed before leaving for the church vigil. “It was later when he met the woman still as he left her on the bed that he raised alarm and went to the police station to report the case. He was arrested and detained.” The charge was not read to the suspect when he was arraigned on Monday, because the magistrate court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The file was sent to the Department of Public Prosecution for advice. Magistrate Andrew Jaja ordered that the accused person should be remanded in prison custody, before adjourning the case till June 13,
