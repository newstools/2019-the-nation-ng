Bishop Francis Wale Oke of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries has described late Olowo of Owo, Oba Victor Olateru-Olagbegi as a man who lived an exemplary and Godly life. Wale Oke in his condolence message to the people of Owo Kingdom and the Ondo State Government on the demise of the royal father who passed away at the age of 77 years, said the death was painful. He pointed out that the monarch contributed meaningfully to the development of his area and the state as well as the nation as a whole. While bemoaning that the royal father would be missed by all, Wale Oke prayed that God would uphold the people of his community and the state.
