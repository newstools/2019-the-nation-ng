The National Association of   Produce Dealers (NAAPD) is to partner the 57 councils in Lagos State to tackle the collection of illegal toll on food items on the highways. Its National Secretary, Kingsley Chikezie, broke the news at an interactive session involving NAAPD,  the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and Heads of Department of Agriculture and Social Services in the 57 councils on the implementation of the Federal Government’s policy on illegal and multiple levies and taxes on agriculture produce on highways, parks and markets. Chikezie said the law stated that no person,  tax officer or representative  of government could collect any levy on the road, except in the market. The association, he said,  had  the  government’s backing to work with law enforcement agencies to stop the collection of such fees. The association, he said,  was working on a tripartite agreement with the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria on the stoppage of illegal tolls on farm produce across the country. ‘’We want those illegal toll collectors to leave the roads and come to the market, as it amounts to double taxation. Our action is masses oriented. In the midst of the mobility and funding challenge we face, we want to ensure that nobody goes to the highway to collect tolls on agricultural produce,”  he said. When these ‘’illegal tolls’’ are removed from the roads, the prices of foodstuffs would be reduced “because as it is today, most of the prices of food are high in Lagos because of multiple taxation.” Head of  Lagos State Board of Agricultural and Social Service Bola Onigbajo, said the government would partner the association on the issue.
