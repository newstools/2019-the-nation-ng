THE Nigerian movie scene is home to a special breed of actors and actresses whose stars have shone brighter and brighter over the years. These ageless and very beloved diamonds have simply refused to fade with time.  Olu Jacobs, Taiwo Ajai-Lycett, Jide Kosoko, Joke Silva, Adebayo Salami (Oga Bello), Idowu Philips (Iya Rainbow), Peter Edochie, Kola Oyewo, Patience Ozokwor, Sunday Omobolanle (Baba Aluwe), Chiwetalu Agu and Kareem Adeboju-Baba Wande, are some of these ageless oldies. These masters are still active in the industry and each day,  you can see them on our screens putting up dominant performances despite their old ages and the stiff competition from Nollywood’s younger, fitter and more active stars. All over the world, in the make-believe industry, stardom has a time limit. This is also true of Nollywood where many oldies are either retired or living penury. Great movie roles tend to go to new kids on the block, who have just recently stepped on the scene. Our beloved veterans are usually pushed aside for less juice roles. But despite all of these, many of these our old veteran thespians are not letting their age deter them from doing what they know how to do best and keeping fit. They established themselves during the most vibrant decades of cinema, the 1970s-80s, and they have become enduring and iconic figures in the world of Nigerian and African movies. It seems like only yesterday that these hot performers in Nollywood caught our attention with their good looks and exciting talent. Today, decades later, they are still at it and doing it better than ever. They are actors with great charismatic screen presence and larger-than-life acting skills. Here are the faces of our Nollywood thespians that are getting hotter and better with age. And they are the reason we all love movies!
