Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Taskforce) Unit in collaboration with Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) Tuesday dislodged over 1500 illegal street traders and arrested 15 of them for prosecution during an enforcement operation at Oyingbo. The operation which was led by the Task force Chairman, Mr. Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, is in continuation of the clampdown on all illegal street-trading activities across the State by the Lagos State Task Force. Egbeyemi, according to a statement from the Agency, said the traders persisted in their illegal trading activities, despite several warnings, displaying and selling wares on main roads, medians, road-setbacks, drainage alignments as well as railway tracks around the entire Oyingbo market area. He said the action of the traders impeded the free flow of traffic along the axis, insisting that Lagos State government will not tolerate such illegal activities that violate the environmental laws of the State. “Section (1) of the Lagos State Street Trading and Illegal Market Prohibition Law of 2003 prohibits both buyers and sellers from engaging in business activities at an unauthorised place, while the penalty for engaging in illegal street-trading is a fine of N90,000 or six-month jail term for anyone found guilty of contravening the law”, the chairman said. “The enforcement operation was also meant to protect lives of the illegal traders from unforeseen circumstances such as accident from reckless private/commercial drivers and also to decongest traffic gridlock along that axis”, he added. While warning those engaged in illegal street-trading to desist from endangering their lives and operate inside the ‘Oyingbo Ultra-Modern Market’ built by the Lagos State Government, Egbeyemi disclosed that all the 15 illegal traders arrested during the exercise will be charged to court for prosecution.
