A 34-year-old man, Cletus Ngbonyebi, yesterday appeared at a Badagry Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for allegedly obtaining N738, 000 under false pretence. He is facing a two-count charge of obtaining money under false pretence and stealing. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Akpan Ikem said the accused committed the offences last November 22 at about 10am at Seme Border area of Badagry. He alleged that the accused collected N738, 000 from the complainant, Shadrack Unachukwu, on the pretext of taking his two brothers-in-law to Morocco. “The accused stole N738, 000, which belonged to the complainant and failed to fulfil his part of the agreement reached with the complainants,” the prosecutor said. The accused, however, denied the charges. Magistrate Patrick Adekomaya admitted the accused to N500, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on May 21.
