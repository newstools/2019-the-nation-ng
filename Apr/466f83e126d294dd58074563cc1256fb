The General Overseer of the Freedom Foundation Apostolic Revival International Ministry, Prophet Samuel Ojo, yesterday denied social media allegations that he raped a female member of his church and extorted N13million from her. The cleric, whose church headquarters is in Ikorodu, Lagos, told The Nation in a phone interview that the rumour could be an attempt to extort money from him. An America-based blogger, Mr Soji Olowogbogboro, posted a video on his YouTube page on March 22, 2019, about people accusing Ojo of extortion, among other indiscretions. But Ojo warned those perpetrating “such rumours” to beware of God’s wrath. He said: “The woman in question and her husband used to be my church member, and she was a close friend to my wife too. They were so close that she followed my wife to hospital to deliver our third baby. “She called me early this year to help her financially and I told her to be patient because I was paying school fees of children, who were under church scholarship. “The next thing I heard were calls from people from Nigeria and abroad that I raped her last year and collected N13 million from her. “So, those of you who are spreading evil rumour about me should ask her of evidence for the allegations against me. If I raped her, she wouldn’t keep quiet. She left my church since last year and is coming out now. “I didn’t do such act, I have been invited by the police and investigation is on. The woman and her cohorts are just trying to blackmail me and destroy my ministry. “In Nigeria, rape is a serious offence. If I had raped her, she would have gone to report me to the police. How can I have carnal knowledge of a woman when I have my own wife? They are just using her to tarnish my image and that of my ministry.”
