The Nigeria Employers Consultative Council (NECA) has urged employers of labour to implement the new minimum wage of N30,000, which has received President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent. Its Director-General, Mr Timothy Olawale said the National Minimum Wage is not a general salary increase, but a wage below which no employer should pay. While affirming organised businesses’ commitment to the implementation of the new wage, Mr. Olawale said: “We reiterate the commitment of employers in the private sector to the implementation of the new National Minimum Wage. “The wage is not a general salary increase, but a wage below which no employer should pay. “As such, employers who are already paying above N30,000 are not obligated to comply. In the same vein, we expect other Social Partners to also respect this understanding, so as not to jeopardise the industrial harmony in the private sector by insisting on implementation by organisations already paying above N30,000.” While commending Buhari, Olawale said payment of the new wage should start immediately. “Organised businesses wish to commend the president for promptly attending to the National Minimum Wage Bill as sent to him by the National Assembly. It is an indication of the passion and concern of the president for the welfare of the masses and working class in particular. We believe that the implementation date will be the date of assent,” Olawale said. Meanwhile, President Buhari at the signing of the bill,  was quoted to have said he expected  workers to be more committed to their jobs. “I expect them (workers) to be more committed to their work at whichever level. I will like, with the cooperation of the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC), to look at the economic situation of the country, the population, the poor infrastructure that we are trying to fix in terms of roads, rail and power. So, I wish Nigerian workers the best of luck,” he  said in a brief speech.
