Suspected hoodlums have attacked a police checkpoint in Asaba, Delta State, leaving three policemen in critical condition, The Nation has learnt. Those injured, it was gathered, included a police inspector, a sergeant and a corporal, who lost his right hand. The attack is the latest on assaults on policemen serving under the command. In September last year, Ughelli Area Command recorded two similar incidents, with the hoodlums carting away rifles belonging to slain policemen. The police team was reportedly manning a checkpoint at Inter-bau roundabout, by ASCON Oil Filling Station, where they were attacked by the hoodlums. A source, who preferred anonymity, said the policemen sustained deep machete cuts after being allegedly disarmed by the hoodlums. He said the hoodlums attacked the police checkpoint shortly after the police patrol van left with the driver and an officer, leaving only three officers behind. The Nation gathered that the first victim had just ordered a motorist making a call in a parked vehicle near the checkpoint to leave when the four assailants attacked him with a machete and made away with his rifle. It was learnt that another group simultaneously attacked the team leader, simply identified as Inspector Francis. He also lost his rifle to the hoodlums. A police corporal reportedly escaped with his rifle, but lost his right hand. The Nation gathered that of the seven policemen at the checkpoint, only five reported for duty on the fateful day. It was learnt that the team leader got a call from one Sergeant Azuka called to send the vehicle to the state headquarters to convey an officer to Area Command at ‘A Division’ a few kilometres away. The Nation gathered that the two policemen that failed to turn up for duty were on guard duty at a popular hotel where a senior officer enjoys free accommodation. Police Commissioner Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, who neither confirmed nor denied the incident, said the command would issue a statement on the incident.
