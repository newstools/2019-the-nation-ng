Mr Davis Iluebbey and Mr Samuel Udezi, Electoral Officers for Abua/Odual and Opobo/Nkoro Local Government Areas respectively, say accreditation and voting for the State Assembly elections are going on peacefully. Iluebbey told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday that although there were little delays because of the heavy rain, electoral materials had been deployed to all the polling units slated for the election. “In Abua/Odual, we have enough electoral materials, and the Presiding and Assistant Presiding Officers (POs and APOs) have left with their electoral materials to the polling units. “There was heavy rain that delayed the process, but voting has started because accreditation and voting are going on simultaneously. According to Iluebbey, although 14 political parties are on the ballot for the Abua/Odual State Constituency Assembly election, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and African Democratic Congress (ADC) are the two leading political parties in the contest. “So far, the election is going on peacefully in all the 181 polling units of the 13 Wards in the LGA. The total number of registered voters in the LGA is 88, 561,” he said. In Opobo/Nkoro LGA, the EO Udezi said that only 20 polling units in five Wards with 7,344 registered voters are affected in the state constituency supplementary election. “We have no issue for now, we have deployed all the materials to the POs and we are even going round to supervise them. “I am currently in Ward 7, Unit 18 and the accreditation and voting are going on peacefully for now,” he said.
