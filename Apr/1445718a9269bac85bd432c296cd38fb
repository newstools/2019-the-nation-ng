If any of the Barcelona players who debuted in the Champions League on September 26, 2012, had been told that seven years later the side would be in a final then they would have surely thought it a crazy notion. But it has come to pass, and the Catalan club’s women’s team will compete in the Champions League final on May 18 in Budapest, becoming the first Spanish side to appear in European club football’s biggest match. They made it to the final by beating Bayern Munich in a tie that will be remembered for some time to come, especially as there was a record attendance of 12,764 at the Mini Estadi for Sunday’s second leg. This total is made all the more impressive given the hangovers likely being suffered by many fans who spent Saturday evening celebrating the men’s LaLiga Santander title, matched with it being election day in Spain. It was a solitary goal that ensured their place in the final, and that strike came courtesy of a Mariona Caldentey penalty at the end of the first half, with the Azulgrana having won the first leg 1-0 as well. Kheira Hamraoui was sent off in the final 20 minutes, but they were able to hold on with 10. Either Lyon or Chelsea will meet them in the final. That second leg will be played in London on Sunday afternoon and the French side have a 2-1 advantage from the first leg.
