Antibacterial brand, Dettol, has announced Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele-Bello as its newest brand ambassador. The actress was unveiled during the launch of the “Clean Naija Initiative” at Radisson Blu Hotel, Ikeja. The General Manager, RB West Africa, Mr. Dayanand Sriram, said: “At RB, we have made it our responsibility and purpose to help people live healthier lives and have happier homes. This is why we are launching the Clean Naija Initiative, which is an integrated multi-level campaign to create awareness, education and drive behavioral change to achieve a cleaner and healthier Nigeria. “The initiative comes at a critical time when Nigeria has been ranked among the top nations that bear a significant portion of the global disease burden and high under-five mortality rate, with over 150,000 children dying yearly. Many of these diseases, such as diarrhea, can be prevented by proper hand washing habits and wide-scale hygiene education. This is a major motivation for the setting up of the Clean Naija Initiative”. Funke Akindele-Bello, who recently welcomed a set of twins, said: “As a new mother, I have come to appreciate more the need for improved hygiene practices. This campaign will help sensitise Nigerians on the health benefits of adopting simple but effective hygienic practices like proper and regular hand washing.”
