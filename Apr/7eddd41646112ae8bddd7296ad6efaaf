The Northwest Coordinator of Forum of New Members of the House of Representatives elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibrahim  Almustapha Aliyu, has confirmed the forum’s unanimous support for and endorsement of House Leader Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the incoming Ninth Assembly by the party. Aliyu addressed reporters yesterday in Sokoto on the speakership of the House of Representatives. The lawmaker said the action of the forum was to uphold party’s supremacy, bolster democracy and ensure stability at the Green Chamber. Saying the forum has 164 members, he added: “We toe the party’s line; we have endorsed the choice of Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the Ninth Assembly. “We are also restating our unalloyed loyalty and commitment to our great party. This, we do, also to ensure that the laudable policies and programmes of the indefatigable and incorruptible President Muhammadu Buhari sail through in the general interests of Nigerians.” Aliyu said the forum was taking advantage of its large membership, which constitutes a significant number of the 360-member House. “This is without the 67 APC returning members. This gives us a comfortable majority. “The forum aims to prevent the ugly development of the Eighth National Assembly, where we tended to tender on a platter of gold our leadership to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by electing persons with uncertain and unstable loyalty to positions of leadership. “This virtually affected the noble objectives and policies of the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration,” he said. Aliyu averred that the forum was formed to show appreciation to the invaluable gesture of the party for giving its members the opportunity to run on its platform. He said: “Having been elected and given the mandate freely by the electorate, we need to pay back. We have to remain loyal as well as uphold the lofty ideals of the APC.”
