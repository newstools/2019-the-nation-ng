The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Bauchi State on Friday filed a petition at the Election Petition Tribunal, challenging the victory of the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Sen Bala Mohammed at the last gubernatorial poll. According to its chairman in the state, Uba Ahmed Nana, Gov Abubakar, the gubernatorial candidate of the party at the last governorship election, is seeking justice from the tribunal. “We are here to file a suit on behalf of the APC challenging the results of the governorship election in Bauchi State held some weeks ago. “What we want is Justice, as always from the Court because we know that the Court will do just that,” he said. It would be recalled that Governor Abubakar had backed down on his earlier decision to concede defeat following declaration of Bala Mohammed as the Governor-elect. The governor had said after due consultations with the national leadership of the APC, the party has agreed to go to court to reclaim his mandate from the PDP. He said it was a decision from the party hierarchy. Abubakar said: “The party has concluded its plans and has hired four Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) to file this suit in court in a short while from now.” But in a swift reaction, the state chapter of the PDP alleged the litigation initiated by the outgoing governor was only meant to waste government resources. It vowed court will validate its victory at the last governorship election. The State Publicity Secretary of the party, Zainabari Yaya in an interview with newsmen, said it was ridiculous for the governor to allege that he was rigged out when he was the one with incumbency power and control of security agents. “Just like we won the case filed by the governor at federal high court in Abuja against the results of Tafawa Balewa local government, we will win again in tribunal. “We are ready to defend our mandate and over 50 independent lawyers have indicated interest to defend us in any court,” he said
