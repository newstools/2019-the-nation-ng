The Minister, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Bello has called on traditional rulers to work with government for the overall development of their subjects and areas of domain. Bello made the call when he received the Estu of Karu,HRH (Dr) Luka Panya-Baba who paid a courtesy visit to the Minister in his office. The Minister also said the FCT Administration was working with all stakeholders inclusive of traditional rulers in states neighboring the FCT to ensure the mutual growth and development of both the FCT and those areas. The Minister commended the leadership of Karu Chiefdom for ensuring that the ingredients needed for growth were present in Karu. The Minister said: “Karu Chiefdom is a community that is destined to grow because you have opened your arms to people from all over the country. They are bringing development to your place and thus, it is a vibrant economic community. He continued: “all that is needed is minimum intervention with respect to needed infrastructure and then it will be like any other developed community because the ingredients for growth and prosperity (which include) solid and focused leadership, an open minded community… and more importantly, peace are already there in your kingdom and I congratulate you for that,” he said. Bello expressed confidence in the leadership of Nasarawa state, adding that the FCT was willing to interface with the state government for the mutual benefit of both the FCT and Nasarawa State. Earlier, the Etsu of Karu who came with a delegation made up of distinguished Karu indigenes had solicited the help of the FCTA for intervention projects aimed at reducing the strain on existing infrastructure, occasioned by sharp increase in population in Karu Community. He attributed the population increase to the proximity of the community to the FCT and the relatively cheap accommodation cost in the area.
