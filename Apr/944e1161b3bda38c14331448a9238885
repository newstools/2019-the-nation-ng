 Young lions of Cameroon Wednesday at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam beat Angola 4-3 on penalties to qualify for the finals of this year’s U17 Nations cup. The match like the first clash of the day between Nigeria and Guinea ended goalless at the end of regulation with eight minutes added time before the teams went into penalty shootout. The Cameroonians converted four of their penalties while their Angolan counterparts only managed to convert three. Cameroon will thus take on Guinea in the final billed for Sunday April 28 while Nigeria will tackle Angola in the third place match scheduled for Saturday April 27th at 2pm. Should Cameroon emerge victorious on Sunday, it would be the second time they will be winning the title after emerging champions in 2003 in Swaziland. Guinea on their own part are playing their first final and dreaming of clinching their first title. No fewer than 59 goals have been scored in this year’s championship so far with the highest recorded in the Nigeria versus Guinea semifinal tie that produced 19 penalty goals ending 10-9 in favour of Guinea.
