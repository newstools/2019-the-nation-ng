The second round of NEROS/ Anambra FA cup match between FC Ifeanyi Ubah and Udala FC played on Thursday could not produce a winner following seizure of football during penalty shootouts. The match, which was played at the Ifeanyi Ubah International Stadium Nnewi, had ended 1-1 apiece in regulation time and went straight into penalties without extra time. Both teams had played one penalty each and scored but the melodrama started when the ball was positioned for Udala FC to take their second kick. However, a spectator suspected to be an ardent follower of one of the teams invaded the pitch, impounded the ball and walked away unhindered. That was how the decisive second round tie ended as match officials did not provide another ball for the penalty kick to continue. A football administrator who pleaded anonymity wondered what the future of football in Nigeria would be when such unsportsmanlike behaviour still existed at match venues. According to the source that saw the match, no security on ground, and no other ball was brought, after a while, the officials also left the pitch. “There were serious confusion, accusations and counter accusations, where is the state football going with this kind of scenario,” he queried. In his reaction, Coach Obinna Dike said it was unconscionable for a football fan who had no business in the pitch to ‘just walk into a football field and seize the match ball’. Obinna, who is the director of DOSAD Sports Academy, Awka, said he would not ascertain who was behind the unfortunate incident but condemned the act in its entirety. “On whose side the trouble is coming from I don’t know. But whoever is party to bringing Anambra football to ridicule, I personally will not accept as a stakeholder,’’ he said. Efforts by NAN to get reaction from the FA did not yield result as the Vice Chairman and a secretary did not respond to calls and messages sent to them.
