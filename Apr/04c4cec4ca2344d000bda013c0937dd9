BET Africa viewers are in for an action packed, drama filled Thursday night as two thrilling brand new shows make their debut on screens. While ‘Being Mary Jane’ reaches its finale, ‘Ladies Night’ and ‘Games People Play’ will take over Thursday night viewing from May 2, 2019 at 21:00 CAT and 21:50 CAT. After four riveting seasons, Being Mary Jane fans will find out if Mary Jane Paul can truly “have it all” in an epic, two-hour series finale movie airing on BET Africa (DStv Channel 129) on Thursday, 25 April. Starring Gabrielle Union, and featuring an all-star cast including Michael Ealy, Morris Chestnut, Lisa Vidal, Richard Roundtree, Margaret Avery, Richard Brooks, BJ Britt, Raven Goodwin and Nicholas Gonzalez. As this chapter ends, Being Mary Jane will bow out with the same authentic voice that emotively resonated with fans and made them fall in love with her lead character and the series. Straight after the divas, audiences can indulge in Games People Play premiering at 21:50 CAT on 2 May. Based on the popular book by Angela Burt-Murray, this sultry new thriller features an ensemble cast of dynamic characters including an ambitious reporter, a desperate housewife, a scandalous seductress and the men in their lives. These millennial women of colour grew up believing they could have it all, and we see the lengths they will go to save themselves, their careers, and eventually each other. During the course of the first season Vanessa King, Nia Bullock and Laila James are going to solve a murder, go undercover to break a mob backed illegal gambling ring, expose a college point shaving scam that unfairly targets disadvantaged college athletes, and become unlikely allies for seasons to come.
