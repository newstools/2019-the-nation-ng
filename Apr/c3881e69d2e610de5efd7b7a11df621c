Eleven former members of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) have received Presidential Honours Award for distinguishing themselves during their service year in Adamawa State. The state Coordinator of the NYSC, Mallam Abubakar Mohammed, said the awardees were among corps members who served the state in 2015/2016/2017. Mohammed said the ex-corps members distinguished themselves in their Community Development Services (CDS) in the areas of construction, organizing extra lessons, donating books and drugs, among others, to their local communities. He said the achievement of the corps members came despite the reputation of Adamawa as an insurgency-troubled state, a reputation which he described as being over stressed. “When corps members are deployed to the state, they develop worries and begin to think of redeployment but when they get firsthand information on the true security situation, they change their mind against locating to another state,” he said. He urged serving corps members and potential ones to be diligent and seek always to impact on the communities they serve, saying, “It is not difficult to win any award, as one of the criteria is performance at places of primary assignment.” The 11 Adamawa ex-corps members were among the 168 to whom President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday presented awards at the combined 2015/2016/2017 President’s NYSC Honours Award held at the State House Banquet Hall, Abuja. Buhari, who was represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, also announced automatic employment to the awardees and scholarship up to doctorate level in Nigerian universities.
