Six suspected cultists have appeared before an Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court for alleged robbery and killing of an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). They are Akinwale Bamido, 25; Olanrewaju Bamido, 22; John Matter, 21; Moses Adeniyi, 23; Shola Olatoye, 25 and Okechukwu Augustine, 18. The defendants are facing a four-count charge of conspiracy, murder, robbery and membership of an unlawful society. Their pleas were not taken. Prosecuting Inspector Maria Dauda said they committed the offence last November 27 at ‘D’ Spot, Badagry Expressway, Ijanikin, Lagos. Dauda alleged that the defendants robbed 45-year-old ASP Abiodun Akinde of his phones, car keys and N20,000 as well as shot him dead. “The defendants, who belong to a cult called “Aiye Confraternity”, shot Akinde to death,” he said. Magistrate Monisola Ayinde ordered that they be kept in Ikoyi Prison, pending advice by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The case continues on May 20.
