Authorities of the Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Ikorodu, yesterday refuted the claim by one of his staff members that the just concluded 2018/2019 examinations were fraudulent. A statement signed by the polytechnic’s Deputy Registrar, Information and Public Relations, Mr Olanrewaju Kuye, said the examinations were well conducted in sync with best global practices, including both internal and external moderation of questions. ‘’ Adequate security and medical services, power supply and all other essential needs were put in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the examinations, despite the attempts made by the non-academic staff unions to disrupt the academic exercise. ‘’It should be on record that Mr Salami Gbenga, who granted the interview, casting aspersions on the conduct of the examinations was never a member of the non-academic staff union, talk less of being the spokesman of the union as he claimed in the said interview. ‘’ It should be noted that Mr Salami participated fully in the invigilation of the exercise (examinations), graded the students’ scripts and had since submitted his results. There was no time he reported any wrongdoing throughout the conduct of the examinations”. Kuye noted that protesting non-academic staff members actually attempted to cut off essential services, including water supply, generating set and medical services needed for the conduct of the examinations, but they were thwarted by the management of the polytechnic. ‘’The management of the institution thwarted their plans with the support of the security agencies to ensure the smooth conduct of the examinations that started on Monday March 4 and lasted for three weeks without a hitch,’’he said.
