Following the incessant killings witnessed in Benue state, chairman of Agbaduma Development Association (AGA), Makurdi branch, Benjamin Eigege on Wednesday called on the state and federal governments to deploy security men in Aila community. Eigege said the measure is to save lives of the people of Aila in Egba ward in Agatu local government area, Benue south from total elimination by suspected militia. He said the suspected militia have so far killed 10 persons in Aila and set houses ablaze, with hundreds of people rendered homeless. A statement made available to newsmen in Makurdi Wednesday, Eigege said that the lingering crisis assumed a more dangerous dimension on March 18th when an Aila man Nghede Ibrahim was shot dead in a fishing pond by suspected militia from Egba an adjoining village. He said while the acting chairman of Agatu Local Government Council Alhaji Oyigbocho visited Aila community to calm fray nerves and pleaded against reprisal attacks; some suspected militia stormed Aila community and killed 9 persons immediately he left. “They set over hundred houses on ablaze and property worth millions destroyed,” said Eigege.
