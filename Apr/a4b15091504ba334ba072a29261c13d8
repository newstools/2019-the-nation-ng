A 26-year-old man, Sylvanus Chidiebere, charged with alleged attempt to defile an eight-year-old girl, has been granted a N200,000 bail. Mrs Olufunke Sule-Amzat of the Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court ordered Chidiebere to provide two sureties as part of the bail conditions. The sureties, she said,  should be employed and should show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the unlawful sexual harassment charge. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Benson Emuerhi said the defendant committed the offence on March 21 at 3, Adeoye Street, Bolade Oshodi, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant was arrested by the police after the case was reported by the victim’s mother at Akinpelu Police Station. “It was later transferred to the Gender Section of the Lagos State Police Command, Ikeja, for further investigation,’’ he said. The prosecutor said the defendant sexually harassed the girl by spilling sperm on her cloth while trying to defile her.
