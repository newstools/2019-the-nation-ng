A special Easter programme organised by the founder and Global Pastor of City of Faith Ministries, Prophet Evans Oppong, will hold from April 26 to 28 at the Bespoke Centre, Lekki, Lagos. The programme, tagged: Supernatural Visitation: Let the Prophet Speak, will be attended by other ministers and gospel artistes, like Sammie Okposo. Oppong said: “Supernatural visitation is a global conference, from city to city and nation to nation. It is a call to send a sure prophetic instruction to people across the globe. It has always been my passion praying for nations and leaders across the globe.” The cleric said this is the time all hands must be on deck to bring revival to all communities and ensure that many lost souls get back on track. “I am, therefore, not surprised that God has charged me with the mandate for the world. I am passionate about revolutionising our generation through knowledge,” he said.
