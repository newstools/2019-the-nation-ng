A 12-year-old girl has told The Nation how a carpenter fixing a ceiling in one of the rooms at their three-bedroom apartment tried to rape her. Speaking yesterday at their home in Fadeyi, Lagos, she said the incident occurred on Saturday morning. Said she: “I was in the house with my mother, aunty and my younger sister when a carpenter came there to fix a ceiling. “While he was working, my aunty noticed that he stood on a bucket that belongs to  our neighbour. She asked him why he used what was not ours, took the bucket from him and handed it back to our neighbour. She promised to get him a stool. While she was going out, I followed her, but changed my mind later. I turned back at the door, only to face the carpenter. He beat my ‘bombom’ (buttocks). I was afraid, I went to the toilet to urinate. He came to the toilet, opened the door and went back. When I came out of the toilet, I was afraid. So I went outside to meet my aunt, while he was coming inside. The distance between us was very close, and he started ‘fingering’ me. I screamed and ran outside to meet my aunty, who was already coming inside with the stool.” The aunt, Rosemary Eke, corroborated the girl’s statement. The victim’s mother, Akpan Winifred, said: “I asked the carpenter what he did to the girl. He initially denied the act, but later confessed, apologising. He promised not to do so again. I told him that being sorry was not enough. I narrated what happened to our neighbours. He was beaten up, but he later ran away. “We told the landlady what happened because the carpenter said she sent him to fix the ceiling. “When my landlady was asked if she sent the carpenter, she denied. This prompted me to report the incident at Alakara Police Station, Mushin, Lagos. “When we got to the station, she admitted that she sent the carpenter to fix the ceiling, and the man was arrested.”
