A 40-year-old pastor, John Apeh, yesterday in Lagos appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding a woman of N1 million. Apeh, who lives at Ipaja, Lagos, pleaded not guilty to two counts of stealing and obtaining money under false pretences. Prosecuting counsel Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde said the defendant committed the offence on March 28, at Anifowose, Ikeja, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant obtained N1million from Mrs. Funke Tola on the pretext of using the money to help her offset her debt. Ayorinde said the complainant had some “money issues” with her business partner and was arrested. He said the complainant wrote an undertaking to pay part of the money to her business partner. “The complainant was ill the day she was to make the first payment. “She transferred the money on agreement to the defendant, who is her friend and pastor, to help her deliver it to her business partner at the station. “After the defendant received the alert, he disappeared and efforts to retrieve the money failed,” the prosecutor said. He said the defendant was later arrested and handed over to the police. The offence, Ayorinde said, contravened sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate B.O. Osunsanmi admitted the defendant to N300, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on July 3.
