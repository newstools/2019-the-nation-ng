The federal government has proposed N24b for the East West road from a total of N46b for the entire Niger Delta region in the 2019 fiscal year, it emerged on Thursday. The House of Representatives has however condemned the allocation of just 17 projects to the entire region in 2019 while describing as unacceptable the litany of uncompleted projects across the region. Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Usani Uguru Usani, while presenting the 2019 budget proposal said the entire envelope for the Ministry was N46 billion. The Minister complained the budgeting process needed to be reviewed, saying: “Projects in 2017 were rolled over in 2018 and in 2019. We are concentrating on the ongoing projects. Only 17 news projects were initiated in 2019 budget. “I agree perfectly that the budgeting process deserves a review because for now, it appears budgeting is like a discussion”. On the breakdown of the proposal, he said N24b was projected for the East west road while N914.7m was for agriculture. He also said while 17 new projects were introduced in 2019 budget, N1.092b was budget for electricity projects, N980.9m for building of schools in the area and Erosion control was allocated 4.5b. According to the Minister, N970.7m was budgeted for water facilities while N349.025m was for hospital and clinics. The Committee however expressed displeasure over numerous uncompleted projects in the nine States of the region. Committee Chairman, Etuk Ekpeyong said: “There are so many uncompleted projects littered around the Niger Delta region. “I want to draw the attention of the Ministry that this session is drawing to a close and the Ministry has to commission some of these projects. “Why has the Ministry refused to allocate the houses? The level of waste in government is terrible. Houses have been completed but not allocated. “It is like this all over the 9 states in the Niger Delta and there is no step in the 2019 budget to show the Ministry’s will to allocate those projects. We should not allow these investments to be wasted.” Committee member, Istafanus Gyang accused the Ministry of underperformance in 2018. He said it is time for the Federal government to be realistic with national budget. “The Ministry didn’t perform well in 2018. Niger Delta region has many intervention agencies but has not reflected that in bringing about the desired development of the region. “The Federal government should be realistic with national budget.”
