Sen. Shehu Sani (PRP-Kaduna Central) on Tuesday urged governments to take more proactive measures to address the overwhelming security challenges facing the Northern part of the country. Sani spoke while receiving groups from Birnin Gwari,  Chikun Local Government Areas and representatives of Zamfara indegines resident in Kaduna. The groups presented a letter of complaint on the insecurity challenges facing them in their various communities for onward submission to the National Assembly. Sani said the entire Northern region was currently under siege and being faced with various security challenges. “Today the entire Northern Nigeria is under siege. In the North West it is the armed bandits, the North Central is experiencing Herdsmen attacks and the  North East is ravaged by insurgents. “In Kajuru, it is Muslims and Christians against one another, in Birnin Gwari it is banditry and kidnapping and along Kaduna Abuja Highway, it is kidnapping and raping. “I have been visiting you regularly and this time you are in my residence. I have listened to your lamentation, tears, cries and appeals. ” I believe any conscious Nigerian is aware of what you are facing in Birnin Gwari. “I must say the issue of Birnin Gwari reflects the fears and dangers we are facing in North West today. “Kidnapping is what we used to hear of in  Niger Delta. Today Birnin Gwari, Chikun, Niger and Zamfara States are under siege,” Sani lamented.
