The Cross River Command of the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a 50-year-old man, Marshal De-souza, for allegedly being in possession of 32 sacks of cannabis sativa (Indian hemp) in Calabar. The state Commander, Mrs Anthonia Edeh, disclosed this yesterday in a statement in Calabar. She said the suspect was arrested by the command’s motorised patrol team following intelligence report. Edeh said the suspect concealed the drugs under black polythene to ward-off suspicion by law enforcement agents. “The suspect and the exhibit were later brought to the office where the substance were tested and weighed 344.1kg and tested positive for cannabis sativa,’’ she said. She said the suspect had provided useful information to the command and had been charged to court accordingly. Edeh said the command was doing everything within its power to reduce the prevalence of illicit drug trafficking and abuse. “I appeal to the public to assist us with useful information and to stand against the efforts of criminals tarnishing the image of this state.
