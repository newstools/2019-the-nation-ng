THE Supreme Court has received the records of proceedings at the lower courts in relation to the appeal filed by Zamfara State Governor-elect Mukhtar Idris and 37 others. The appeal is against the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sokoto. The compilation and transmission of records by an appellant and the receipt of such records by the Supreme Court are major requirements for a competent appeal. The Court of Appeal in Sokoto had, in a judgment some weeks ago, faulted the primary elections conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state prior to the last general elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), acting on the Appeal Court’s judgment, has failed to issue the certificates of return to Idris (the governor-elect) and others, who are also members of the APC, elected to the state’s House of Assembly. Idris and others are, by their appeal, seeking among others, the setting aside of the judgment by the Appeal Court in Sokoto. It was learnt that although the records of appeal have been received at the Registry of the Supreme Court, a date is yet to be set for the hearing of the appeal. The Nation learnt that parties to the appeal are required to file, serve and exchange their various briefs of argument before a date could be set for the hearing of the appeal. A senior court official informed The Nation that in view of the urgency involved, the case being election-related, the court could be moved to abridge time. The official said the court may abridge the time for parties to file and serve their processes because of the nature of the case and the urgency involved. Idris and others had last week, written to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmud Yakubu, drawing his attention to the notice of appeal filed at the Supreme Court. In the letter dated April 2, 2019, authored by their lawyer, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), Idris and others argued that the judgment by the Court of Appeal in Sokoto contained no positive or direct order.
