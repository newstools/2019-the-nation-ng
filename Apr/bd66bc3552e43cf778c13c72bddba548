The Ondo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress(APC) Ondo State on Friday lauded the successful inauguration of his commissioners and other ranks of political office holders in Ekiti State. The party said the step was commendable especially for shortlisting a set of politicians and technocrats of high integrity to serve the state. A statement by the Director of Media and Publicity, Steve Otaloro noted that the coming on board of new commissioners in a record time, confirmed the commitment of Fayemi as a true democratic to regain the lost glory of Ekiti State. The statement said” Everyone can attest to your faithfulness to develop your home state socially and economically and to evolve a lasting solution to its political problems. ” With your past history of the struggle to achieve an inclusive and a democratic constitution, we shall continue to work with you and support the people and the government in an effort to bring honour and pride to Ekiti State”. Ondo APC also acknowledged Fayemi’s sterling performance since assumption of office as noteworthy and praiseworthy, urging him not to relent. It said” Our party’s victory in Ekiti State in the last poll is an affirmation of the level of confidence the Ekiti people repose in you. It is a testimony to the high level of hope your people placed on you for the redemption of the lost glory of Ekiti State.
