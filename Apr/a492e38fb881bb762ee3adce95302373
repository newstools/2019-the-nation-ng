REPORT of the much-awaited 2019 Appropriation Bill was laid in the Senate and House of Representatives yesterday. The Appropriation committees of the two chambers submitted a harmonised budget report for consideration and adoption. At the upper chamber, the Senate Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Mohammed Danjuma Goje, submitted the report while his counterpart at the Green Chamber, Mustapha Dawaki did the same. Both chambers did not consider the report of the N8.83 trillion Budget, proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari for the 2019 fiscal year. The lawmakers, who have proceeded on Easter break are to reconvene on April 24 to pass the budget, it was learnt. The House of Representatives, which also adjourned plenary, will reconvene on April 23 to pass the budget. It is not clear whether there were major changes and additions made in the money bill as proposed by President Buhari. Senate President Bukola Saraki had mandated sub-committees to adopt the Executive submission of the budget in place of any ministry, department or agency that failed to turn up to defend their budgets.
