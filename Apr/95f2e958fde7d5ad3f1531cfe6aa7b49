 The ‘Lucky Boy’ defeated Nicaragua’s Ricardo Blandon (10-2, 6 KO) on scores of 114-111 across the board to become the first black from Africa that will ever fight and win WBC title in Dubai. In a chat with NationSports, Lasisi gave credit to Randon for stretching the fight till the last round. “Its amazing winning this WBC International title belt because I have been dreaming this day long time ago, but Alhamdulilah, Allah made it happen against Randon.  “He did not knock me down in round four, he only pushed me back and I complained to the referee. I was surprised the referee was making count for me. I didn’t believe what the referee did to me and fans at the hall also complained about the incident but I put myself back on the track.  “I want to thank all my fans all over the world for believing in me. I want to thank MKT Global and Round 10 Boxing Club, they came together and they made it happen. I am happy to fight under the card. My appreciation also goes to my sponsor Top8 and Angelsyrup,” Lasisi told NationSport. Lasisi, who had vowed to knockout his opponent in round 7, however, met a stiffer opposition in the determined Blandon as he was forced to go 12 rounds for the first time in his career, barely three months after going a previous career-long 10 rounds in his most recent contest last December in Ghana, where he defeated Mchanja Yohana of Tanzania to win the WBC International Silver Super Flyweight title.  There was also a point deduction in round four, with Lasisi losing a point due to a clash of heads in the 12 round clash, which headlined the “Fight DXB Uncovered Show” packaged by Round 10 Boxing Club in association with international boxing powerhouse MTK Global.
