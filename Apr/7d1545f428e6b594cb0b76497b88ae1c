U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday congratulated Benjamin Netanyahu for his election performance, as it became clear the Israeli prime minister would get another term. Trump, who is perceived as a staunch supporter of the Israeli premier, told reporters that a Netanyahu victory would increase the chances for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. “I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won,’’ Trump said before departing the White House. Netanyahu’s Likud party and its allies are forecast to be the largest bloc in the Israeli parliament, putting him on course for a fifth term in office. Trump has moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recently recognised the Israeli annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. He also designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps this week as a foreign terrorist organization.
