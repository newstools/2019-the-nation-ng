Investigative journalist Tobore Ovuorie is set to screen her film titled ‘Why?’, part of documentary series which focus on stigmatisation of people living with HIV. The screening which is free to attend holds by 4pm on Thursday, April 18 at Civic Hive, Yaba, Lagos. The film is a fall-out of Ovuorie’s 2018 investigative series on HIV in children of school age in Nigeria. The series were published in August last year in The Nation newspaper. Her investigations revealed discrimination against children living with HIV, with some of them being denied access to education. “This is against their fundamental human rights and SDG three and four respectively which seeks access to quality health and education for all, respectively,” said Ovuorie. The films were independently funded by Ovuorie.
