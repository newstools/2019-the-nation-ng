Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 600th career club goal and 20th of the season in Juventus’ 1-1 draw with Inter Milan on Saturday. The Portugal international smashed home a shot from just outside the penalty area from a Miralem Pjanic heel flick to level the score with Inter at 1-1 just past the hour mark after Radja Nainggolan had put the hosts in front in the first half. Ronaldo’s Juventus side had already clinched the Serie A title but he was handed the start in search of another remarkable milestone in his illustrious career. The bulk of Ronaldo’s goals came during his time with Real Madrid, where he scored 450 times across all competitions, followed by 118 during his time with Manchester United, five for his first club Sporting CP and 27 for Juventus including today’s strike. Ronaldo is the only player to have won a top-flight crown in England, Spain and Italy with three Premier League titles, two La Ligas, one in Serie A and five Champions League crowns to go along with a host of league cup and Club World Cup wins. Juventus, who exited the Champions League at the quarterfinal stage at the hands of Ajax and are out of the Coppa Italia, have four matches remaining in their Serie A campaign. (ESPN)
