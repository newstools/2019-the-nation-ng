Stefano Pioli has resigned as coach of Fiorentina, the Serie A club said on Tuesday. Fiorentina lost 0-1 at home against second-last Frosinone on Sunday and remained in 10th position, 12 points off the UEFA Europa League zone with seven games remaining. La Viola have lost three and drawn four of the last seven league games. They are to play the second leg match of the Italian Cup semi-finals away to Atalanta on April 25, after the first leg ended in a 3-3 draw. The club said assistant coach Giacomo Murelli was leading the Tuesday training session. “Sadly, I feel forced to resign after my professional and personal capabilities have been called into question,” Pioli told the ANSA news agency. The 53-year-old Pioli took over Fiorentina in 2017, leading them to eighth place in the past season NAN
