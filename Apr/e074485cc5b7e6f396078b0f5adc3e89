 Fulham have been relegated from the Premier League after suffering a humiliating 4-1 defeat at Watford on Tuesday night. The Cottagers conceded three goals in just 12 minutes to end their miserable return to the top flight of English football and consign themselves to the Championship once again. Despite a record outlay of over £100million on transfers last summer – the most ever spent by a newly-promoted club – they failed to produce on the pitch, picking up just 17 points from 33 games. Slavisa Jokanovic was axed in November after maintaining the style of play that got them promoted but failed to adapt it to the Premier League as they became unstuck. Claudio Ranieri came in to steady the ship but they continued to struggle to collect points. The Italian left in February before Scott Parker was handed the reigns. It was too late by then though and they have now been relegated with five matches left. There was much optimism around Craven Cottage last summer when Fulham broke their transfer record three times. However, of their permanent buys, only Aleksandar Mitrovic shone with midfield duo Jean Michael Seri and Andre Frank Zambo Anguissa, who cost around £55m between them, struggling to adapt. Fulham’s defence was catastrophic all season and continued to cost them when their attack looked bright. They have conceded 76 goals in 33 matches, the worst record in the top flight by some distance, with neither Jokanovic, Ranieri or caretaker boss Parker able to tighten things up. There were also off-field issues that threatened to derail their season with Ranieri admitting at one stage that he wanted ‘kill’ Aboubakar Kamara after he snatched the ball from Mitrovic to take a penalty, and then missed, against Huddersfield.
