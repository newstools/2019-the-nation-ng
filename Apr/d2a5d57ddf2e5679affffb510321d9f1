Oando Plc yesterday posted N28.8 billion profit after tax (PAT) at the end of its financial year ended December 31, 2018. This reflects a 46 per cent increase over the N19.8 billion recorded the previous and also a positive result for the third consecutive year. The financial result is a testament to the company’s concerted efforts and commitment to reversing the tide following the oil price crash in 2014.  The oil firm has successfully executed strategic initiatives that have enabled continued growth across all financial performance indices three years in a row despite a challenging local terrain.  Its positive performance has ensured it maintains its position as Nigeria’s leading indigenous oil company. During the period under review, turnover increased by 37 per cnet to N679.5 billion compared to N497.4 billion in 2017, driven primarily by higher oil prices resulting in higher oil revenue and higher gas prices, which led to higher gas revenues. In addition, gross profit grew by nine per cent to N96.3 billion from N88.1 billion in 2017. Its balance sheet remained strong with a 46 per cent increase in PAT to N28.8 billion from N19.8 billion in the comparative period of 2017 driven by higher revenue and income tax credits. Its total Group borrowings decreased by 11 per cent  to N210.9 billion from N237.4 billion in 2017, while long term borrowings decreased by 23 per cent to N76.8 billion compared to N99.6 billion in the same period of 2017. Since its acquisition of ConocoPhillips Nigeria in 2014, Oando has embarked on a proactive drive to significantly reduce its debt and liabilities.  From a N473.3 billion corporate facility in 2014 to N210.9 billion in FYE 2018, a 55 per cent decrease and in its upstream business, the company has reduced its debt by 70 per cent from $801.6 million in 2014 to $260 million as at FYE 2018. Speaking on the significant reduction in borrowings, its Group Chief Executive, Wale Tinubu, said: “Our asset base is delivering strong free cash flows as evidenced by a 70 per cent reduction in our upstream borrowings since the closure of our landmark acquisition of ConocoPhillips’s Nigerian assets in 2014. “Our 2018 results demonstrate the solid foundation we have built across volatile commodity price cycles, and our ability to deliver profitability despite a challenging local operating environment. Over the last few years, we have developed a reliable platform for future growth through the execution of a corporate strategy designed to streamline our operations, reduce our debt and optimise our asset portfolio.” The company’s FYE 2018 results are further evidence that the company’s management team is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, profitability, value creation and a business that is indeed here for good.  The company’s third year of strong financial performance is evidence that the company is back to business as usual, thus rebuilding stakeholder confidence in the brand as a viable business to invest in. Speaking on the results, Alhaji Kabiru Tambari, an Oando shareholder from Sokoto Zone Shareholders Association, commended the management of Oando for leading the company to yet another profit, he said: “We can see light at the end of the tunnel. My faith in the management of the company grows from strength to strength with each financial result. I’m hopeful that soon, in the very near future we the shareholders can finally reap the fruits of our labour. “We remain confident in our ability to deliver significant value to shareholders in the years ahead as well as resuming our dividend payments.”
