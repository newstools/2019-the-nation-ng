GIFTED with a beautiful voice, singer turned co-movie producer Waje, alongside three other artistes – IBK Spaceshipboi, Praize and Always Good came together to work on a new single titled ‘Because Of You’ – a song they said is dedicated to God’s presence. Speaking on the collaboration, Waje noted that, “Gratitude is a selfless act: it builds relationships and attracts us to people with that positive vibe which amplifies success. That’s why we got together, that’s how we made this song and that’s why we are passing on the positive vibes. Show love to whoever comes your way because everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Recall that last week, the National President of Fellowship of Gospel Music Ministers of Nigeria (FOGMMON), Asu Ekiye, called up the popular singer to go back to where she started her singing career; the church.
