The 26-year-old is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world and has kept 115 clean sheets in 203 appearances since joining the club in 2014. “I am very happy to have signed a contract extension and to be here,” Oblak said. “I’m going to defend these colours to the best of my abilities and continue working hard.” Oblak joined as a replacement for Thibaut Courtois, who returned to Chelsea following his loan spell in the Spanish capital and helped the club win the Spanish Super Cup in his first season. The Slovenia international has since added the Europa League and UEFA Super Cup — while his penalty save in the 2016 Champions League semifinal win over Bayern Munich helped Atletico reach a second final in three years. “The agreement certainly is great news for the Atleti Family, as we ensure the continuity of one of the world’s finest goalkeepers,” the club wrote on their website.
