The Cooking Gas Skid Proprietors Association of Nigeria (CGSPAN) has lauded the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu’s plan  to put legislation in place to compel petroleum product marketers to set up gas filling plants in all the petrol stations across the country. According to CGSPAN spokesman, Otunba Shittu Moshood,  Kachikwu gave the directive while inuagurating Nigerian Army Welfare Limited by Guarantee, NAWLG/Gasland Nigeria Limited, Liquefied Petroleum Gas plant in Mambila Barracks, Abuja, and the launch of LPG Micro Distribution Centres in the Nigeria Army barracks and cantonments. The Minister explained further that the legislation is to be put together by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as part of efforts to deepen LPG usage across the country. Chairman of CGSPAN, Alhaji Adebisi Bada, in his address to members in Abeokuta, Ogun State, said having LPG skid plants in filling station is safe and appropriate. “Skid operations in filling station to the best of my knowledge are very safe contrary to some naive opinion from some quarters. In as much as appropriate safety measures, which the Association is championing, are put in place by the operators, the attendant risks involved would have been curtailed,” he said. Bada emphasised that skid operations was capable of providing thousands of jobs for the youths while boosting the availability of LPG to end-users across the country. He  added that having LPG skid plant either as a standalone or add-on will help boost the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and bridge the gap between cooking gas users and distributors. The CGSPAN Chairman, however, called on the Minister and DPR to speed up the legislation process so that Nigerians can begin to reap from its abundant gas resources.
