Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has urged the state’s lawmakers to be humbled by their victories and re-dedicate themselves to the service of the people. A statement by his media aide, Simeon Nwakaudu, said Wike spoke when members of the House of Assembly visited him at the Government House yesterday. The statement reads:  “This victory should humble everyone and ensure that we re-dedicate ourselves to serve the people. We should see this as an opportunity to ensure a new beginning. “If you know the kind of things we faced from everywhere, within and outside, then you will always thank God.” Governor Wike stressed that members who lost the party tickets will be accommodated in the government. He particularly praised the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly, Marshal Uwom, and former Speaker Dabo Adams, for remaining loyal despite losing the party’s nominations. Speaker of the House of Assembly Ikuinyi Ibani said the lawmakers were in the Government House to congratulate Wike for his victory in the election. He promised that the Assembly will support the governor to deliver on his campaign promises to the people.
