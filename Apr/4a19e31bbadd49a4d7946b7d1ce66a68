The federal government has so far disbursed over N30billion interest-free loans to Nigerians nationwide in the last four years under the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), The Nation can authoritatively report. The GEEP, is one of the National Social Investment Programmes (N-SIP) of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. Checks by The Nation revealed that the current administration’s micro-credit schemes under the GEEP including: MarketMoni, TraderMoni and FarmerMoni has benefited over two million Nigerians. Since the commencement of the programmes in 2016, there have been success stories of beneficiaries who are paying back their loans and accessing more loans. Also, more beneficiaries are paying up the initial N10,000 loans and have started receiving the second improved interest-free TraderMoni loan of N15,000; including in Lagos, Osun, Borno, Ogun and Benue. Under GEEP, about N30billion has been disbursed nationwide for all GEEP schemes – TraderMoni, MarketMoni and FarmerMoni. Managed by the Bank of Industry, GEEP schemes provide financial support through micro-credit schemes to beneficiaries, which include petty traders, women cooperatives, youths, famers and agricultural workers. TraderMoni is designed to help petty traders expand their trade through the provision of collateral free loans of N10,000. The loans are repayable over a period of six months. Under the scheme, beneficiaries can get access to a higher facility ranging from N15,000 to N50,000 when they repay N10,000 within the stipulated time period. In a related development, in April, TraderMoni, which provides interest and collateral-free loans starting from N10,000 to petty traders nationwide and is payable within six months., has empowered 7,000 petty traders in Benue State with the N10,000 collateral free loans during the special market activation in two popular markets in the state —Makurdi Modern Market and Wurukum Market. In Benue state alone, there have been over 40,000 disbursements for TraderMoni; while there are about 1.5 million TraderMoni beneficiaries in all the 36 states and the FCT, with this number expected to increase with more disbursements to be made in some states in the coming days. One of the beneficiaries of the N15,000 interest-free TraderMoni loan, Jennifer Iorfa, a petty trader from Gboko, Benue State, thanked the Federal Government for the initiative, adding that her business growth has helped her repay the N10,000 loan and also improve the living conditions of her family. “With this N15,000 loan, I will be able to make more kunu, sell more and pay back,” she said. Another petty trader, Agbo Mnena Mercy, a MarketMoni beneficiary who sells grains in Wurukum Market, noted that, receiving her loan, she was able to move from buying grains in measured basins, which costs about N3,000 to buying in bags of up to N15,000 per bag.
