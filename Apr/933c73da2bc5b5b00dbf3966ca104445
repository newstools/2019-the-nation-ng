The Senate Committee on Industry has pledged to support the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON’s) campaign for the patronage of made-in-Nigeria goods. Chairman of the Committee, Senator Sam Egwu, said SON is vital to achieving the present administration’s Executive Order 003 aimed at providing support for local content in public procurement by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as increasing the demand for locally made goods and services in the country. Egwu at an oversight function on SON’s laboratory complex in Ogba, Ikeja, Lagos, yesterday said promoting made-in-Nigeria goods could only be achieved through SON’s quality assurance programmes and activities across the nation. “We have visited other laboratories outside this country and compared to what we have seen outside the country, I will say SON has come to stay. A lot of mileage has been achieved since our last visit in 2018. Within a period of seven months, it is good to see that staff have moved into the laboratory and almost all the laboratories are in operation which is a good development.  This feat could not have been achieved without the Director-General, the management and staff of SON. We just wish you maintain the standards.
