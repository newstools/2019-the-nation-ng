 Super Eagles will on the 30th June at the Alexandria Stadium take on the Barea of Madagascar in the last group match of the Nations cup in Egypt. The Eagles were drawn against debutants Burundi and Madagascar as well as Guinea in Group B. While the Eagles flag off their campaign on the 22nd of June against Burundi, they will face Guinea in the second match on the 26th before rounding off the group hostilities with Madagascar. Will Coach Gernot Rohr launch full attack on Madagascar or will he  choose to be soft on them not only because they are debutants but also because they are his in-laws?. The German tactician, who has been handling the Eagles since 2016 following the exit of former international Sunday Oliseh, is married to a Madagascan who reportedly is in the hospitality industry but avoids publicity. The Rohrs, own a hotel in the French Island with estimated population 25million people. Rohr’s wife does not fancy the idea of travelling with his husband on tournaments but is said to monitor his progress while praying for his success all the same.
