The Military Joint Task Force on Friday arrested two Fulani herdsmen suspected to be perpetrators of Iyemero’s attack. The operational task force compromised combined security forces and local hunters. A farmstead in Eda under Iyemero in Ikole Local Government was attacked last week Monday by some assailants where two persons were killed. Within the last two months, the men of the underworld had attacked five times and raided the village. As result of the gory incident, Governor Kayode Fayemi ordered immediate deployment of military JTF to patrol and raid black spots in the town sharing boundary with  Kwara and Kogi. Fayemi also ordered immediate construction of police post in the town in a bid to curtail the over bearing influence of the herder killer. The head of local hunters in the town, Mr Jimoh Eisikin explained that the alleged herder killers were arrested by his men around 1am on Friday. He said the local hunters working with the security agencies laid ambush for them at Eda and arrested them while on a mission to attack the village. “These herders had been raping our women and killing our people in the last six months. “During the onslaught leading to their arrest yesterday, two of our village hunters were macheted by the evil doers. But for the fact that we were prepared, we got them arrested after chasing them into the bush. “We brought them to Iyemero and tied them down at the village square with close security monitoring”. The Olu of Iyemero, Oba Ebenezer Ogungbemi was said to have called the Police Commissioner, Mr. Asuquo Amba, who sent his men to arrest them and brought the culprits to Ado Ekiti. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, said those arrested are being detained at the police headquarters. “Our men have begun investigation into their case and they will be charged to court upon conclusion of our investigation,” Ikechukwu said.
