A man, Kunle Bisi, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for allegedly stealing motor parts worth N500,000. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti said the defendant committed the offence on April 19 at Ladipo, Mushin, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant trespassed into the warehouse of Mr. Osita Nwafor to steal his goods. Koti said the guard saw the defendant carrying the parts out of the warehouse and intercepted him. “On sighting the guard coming towards him, the defendant dropped the goods and escaped. “The guard ran after him, he was apprehended and handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola granted the defendant N100, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 15.
