Manchester Unitedâ€™s hopes of clinching the top four in EPL suffered a debilitating setback on Sunday with a 4-0 thrashing by Everton. The loss compounded the woes of Red Devils after elimination from the Champion League by Spanish giant, FC Barcelona last Tuesday. Richarlison opened scoring for Everton with a well-taken bicycle kick following a corner before Sigurdsson fired home a grounder shot to take the score to 2-0 at halftime. Lucas Digne and Theo Walcott completed the massacre of the Red Devils who were left with a mountain to climb for Champion League spot next season.
