A 35-year-old hair stylist, Anita Samuel, was  on Wednesday arraigned before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stabbing her friend with a coca cola bottle on the head. It was alleged that Anita hit her friend, Ediomo Linus, on the head with coca cola bottle for refusing to let her have a taste of her cassava flakes. The defendant, resident at 22 Osho Street, Ikorodu, Lagos, was arraigned on a lone count charge of assault before Chief Magistrate Mrs O.A. Layinka. Prosecuting counsel, Akeem Raji, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), told the court that  the defendant committed the offence on March 12 at 12.00 p.m. at No.15 Ogunsefunmi Street, Ikeja, Lagos. ASP Raji alleged that the defendant allegedly assaulted Ediomo by stabbing her with a broken coke bottle on her head, following an unresolved disagreement. Raji told the court that the defendant had told the complainant to let her have a taste of the cassava flakes she was eating but she refused. He said that the following day, the complainant greeted the  defendant but she did not return the gesture. He said this  later led to an argument which  made the defendant to lock the door on the complainant, hit her with a coke bottle on the head and gave her the beating of her life. The defendant denied the charge. The Chief Magistrate Layinka granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties each in the like sum. Layinka ruled that the sureties must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified by the court. She adjourned the case till April 25.
