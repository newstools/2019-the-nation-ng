A businessman, Uchechukwu Anyagwa, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court, for allegedly obtaining N5.242 million under the guise of securing a Canadian visa. Anyagwa, who lives at 31, Adebayo Street, Dopemu, Lagos, is charged with conspiracy, fraud, stealing and forgery. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada alleged that Anyagwa, with others at large, committed the offence between last October 24 and November 27, at Aguda, Lagos. He said the defendant obtained N5.24 million from the complainant, Mr. Kelechi Ehirim, on the pretext of securing the visa. Eruada said the defendant told Ehirim that he was a licensed agent of the Canadian Embassy. He alleged that Anyagwa, who did not secure the visa, forged a Canadian visa and gave the complainant as genuine. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant had once forged an Ireland visa dated November 13, 2018. He said the offence contravened sections 287, 313, 365 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate M. I.
