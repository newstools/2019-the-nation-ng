The police Tuesday arraigned a 19-year-old house help, Alice Egun, before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing five gold necklaces worth N5.1 million belonging to her employer. Egun, who lives with her employer in Iju Ishaga area of Lagos as at time of incident, is facing a two-count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing before Chief Magistrate O.A. Layinka. The Prosecutor, Akeem Raji, a Superintendent of Police (ASP), told the court that the defendant committed the offence with others at large on March 8, at 2 p.m. at her employer’s house. ASP Raji alleged that the defendant stole the gold necklaces belonging to the complainant, Hajiya Joke Kudehinbu. According to him, Egun ran away from her employer’s house with the stolen items to an unknown destination. He said it was the complainant’s sister who later sighted the defendant at Ojota and alerted the police and got her arrested. He told the court further that all efforts to recover the stolen gold from the defendant failed. When the charges were read, the defendant pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Layinka granted her bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She said the sureties must also reside within the court’s jurisdiction. Chief Magistrate Layinka thereafter adjourned the case till May 20.
