A 56-year-old man, Olushola Onanuga, yesterday appeared at an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court, for allegedly defrauding an accommodation seeker of N170, 000. Onanuga, who lives at Afolabj Street, Alapere, Ketu, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of obtaining by false pretence and stealing, to which he pleaded not guilty. But prosecuting Inspector Lucky Ihiehie insisted that the defendant committed the offence on February 12, at Idowu-Dada Street, Ogudu Ori-Oke. He said the complainant, Mr. Jackson Monday, reported the case at Ketu Police Station. Ihiehie said the defendant collected the money from the complainant to secure a one-bedroom flat at Ketu. “After collecting the money, the defendant gave the same flat to another person, who has moved in. “Efforts by the complainant to get his money back proved abortive,’’ the prosecutor said. The offence contravenes sections 314 (2) and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). Ruling, Magistrate H. B. Mogaji granted the defendant N100, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties should provide evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on April. 29.
