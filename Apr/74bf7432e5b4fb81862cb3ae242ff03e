Public secondary school teachers who were recruited by the immediate administration on Thursday protested non-payment of the last seven months salaries. The protesting teachers, who were over 500, converged on Ikere Ekiti to lament their hardship. They disclosed several efforts to get the attention of the government have not been successful, as no concrete step has been taken to either pay them or dialogue with them. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Mr. Bayo Omoyeni, said that letters were written to the governor, his wife, the deputy governor and some traditional rulers urging them to intervene and end the untold hardship being experienced by the teachers. Omoyeni said: “These efforts have not yielded any desired result because we have not received any communication from them. “I am speaking on behalf of secondary school teachers employed in September 2018. We are here today to protest the non-payment of our salaries. And we want the government to immediately react to our demand and such reaction must be done between now and Monday when we are resuming for third term. “We are using this medium to tell Mr Governor to immediately speak with us. How can the governor set up a panel where none of us were invited to come and defend our case? “The news all over the state is that we are politicians, that we are partisan. We want to use this medium to tell him that we are not members of any political party. “We are youth of Ekiti State seeking employment and were given employment by the previous administration and it is trite that government is a continuum. “We went through interview and letters of employment were given to us and not only that, we were deployed to various schools in the state to work. Up till today, there have been no correspondences with us by the present government. The government could owe us salaries but we demand that the governor speak with us.” He demanded for intervention of Governor Kayode Fayemi to end their sufferings.
