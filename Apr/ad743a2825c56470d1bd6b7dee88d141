Sahara Group has urged for collaboration among financial institutions, development agencies, trading companies, National Oil Companies and other stakeholders in , saying it would enhance the contribution of intra-Africa led solutions to addressing the petroleum sector’s trade and project finance challenges on the continent. Executive Director, Sahara Group, Wale Ajibade, made the submission when he gave a keynote address on “Challenges of financing and investing in the African oil industry” at the just held African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) CAPE VII Congress and Exhibition in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. “Our collective mandate and deliverable should be to prioritise African solutions for African challenges. ‘’Our businesses should be given viable incentives to enable them participate specifically in this industry; our development and commercial banks should have a marked incentive, or lower funding rates, for African Companies participating in this space. We must place the utmost value on capacity building and skilled knowledge transfer and training,” Ajibade said. Oil ministers, top-level executives and the continent’s opinion leaders at the conference reinforced the importance of cooperation among African countries as the most sustainable avenue to achieve shared ‘Prosperity in the African Petroleum Industry’. “We need to see more collaboration between African Oil producers in the future as intra African trade can be as large as international trade. We must promote intra-regional trade and encourage government to government contracts underlined by the private sector. This is a cause Sahara Group is passionate about and we will continue to lead the narrative.”
