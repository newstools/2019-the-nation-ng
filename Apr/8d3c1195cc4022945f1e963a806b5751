Chelseaâ€™s hope of a top four finish that will guarantee Champion League football next season got slimmer on Monday evening following a 2-2 draw with Burnley. The Blues received a boost for the top four after Arsenal, Tottenham and Arsenal lost at the weekend. But Chelsea fell behind in the first half before Kante equalized. The club then went ahead with a well-taken Higuain goal before conceding few minutes later. Hopes of a goal-fest evaporated in the second half with Burnley shutting down all the attack threats of Chelsea to leave the Sarri-coached team with just a point to move to fourth place. Had the London team won, it would have leap-frogged Tottenham in the third spot.
