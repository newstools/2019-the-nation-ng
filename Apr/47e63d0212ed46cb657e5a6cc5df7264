The Caretaker Chairman of Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State, Mr Shiban Tikari,  Saturday  imposed restriction on the use of motorcycles in the council area from 7 pm to 6am,  to check kidnapping and armed robbery. Tikari told reporters  in Jalingo that  kidnapping for ransom and armed robbery has become a daily occurrence  in the LGA, adding that the operations are often carried out with the aid of  motorcycles. He said this informed the decision to ban the use of motorcycles in the area from 7pm to 6 am. The Chairman regretted that, in some cases, even after the ransom on those kidnapped had been paid, they still ended up being killed by their abductors. He added that many were still being held after payment of ransom, describing the situation as worrisome. While commending the efforts of the Taraba and Benue governors in ending trans-border crimes, Tikari cautioned against politicising the issue of insecurity in the area. He appealed  to all “patriotic and peace loving people of Takum LGA, including those from the neighbouring communities where this criminality is taking place, to be more vigilant and help us and the security agencies with intelligence to check the menace.” He added:“Security is our collective responsibility and it is high time we all stood up to take positive steps toward tackling the security challenges in our dear local government. “All perpetrators of these criminal acts are advised to repent and desist from their criminal acts as the arm of the law will catch up with them if they fail to heed the warning,” he said.
