Imo State House of Assembly on Tuesday recalled five suspended lawmakers barely six weeks to the end of the tenure of the eight session of the House. The lawmakers were recalled during  plenary presided over by the Speaker of the House , Rt. Hon Acho Ihim. The recalled lawmakers were Chiji Collins(Isiala Mbano),Uche Oguwuike(Ikeduru),Ifeanyi Nnataraonye(Mbaitoli), Donatus Onuigwe(Oru West) and Nkenna Nzeruo(Oru West). The lawmakers were suspended in October 2018  for “unparliamentary conducts”. But an Imo High Court on November 5, 2018, quashed the suspension of four of the five suspended members . The court in lifting  the suspension, described the action as unlawful and not known by the constitution. The presiding justice, Goddy Anunihu,j ointly awarded the applicants the sum of N8m in damages and N100,000 in legal fees. The jurist directed the Speaker  who was the first respondent to pay the applicants their salaries, allowances and emoluments for the period they were suspended.
