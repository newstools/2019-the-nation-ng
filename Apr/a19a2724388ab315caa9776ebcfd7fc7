More than 100,000 people have registered for the mandatory health insurance scheme,  Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA) General Manager (GM) Dr. Peju Adelusi said yesterday. She was answering questions from reporters at a four-day orientation for Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS) ambassadors held in Magodo, Lagos. The agency is training about 100 insurance agents, who will market the scheme. “For starters, we are engaging 100 health insurance agents, who have the mandate to go out there to market the scheme. People have to buy into it to get the benefit of the scheme,” Adelusi said. She said there was need for  foot soldiers who understand the scheme to go out there to talk to people for them to come on board and buy into the scheme People, she said, would  enrol and pay the N40,000 premium for a family of six per year.  Individuals above 18 can also come on board by paying N8,500 every year to access quality health care,  the GM added. “Whatever you are paying is less than what you stand to benefit and you have a right to decide which hospital to use, as it covers public and private hospitals.” Allaying fear of fraud, Adelusi said the agents or ambassadors would not collect cash; they go about with POS. Payment, she said,  could be made by subscribers to any bank in the state. She reeled out the benefits of the scheme, saying : “You stand to gain a lot. There is nothing to lose; there is everything to gain and nothing to lose. Remember that it is a healthy society that can be a productive society.” She advised the participants, who were selected after a competitive screening, to be attentive and to have a passion for what they were being trained for. “They should feel free and see this as an opportunity for information sharing, information gaining and acquiring the skills to go out there as great ambassadors, marketers and sales agents for Lagos State. They are the pioneer set and I think that is a privilege,” Adelusi said.
