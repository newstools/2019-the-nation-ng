The results of this year’s unified tertiary matriculation examination (UTME) will be released as soon as reports from the 687 Computer-Based Test centres used for the conduct of the examination are reviewed, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, has said. The board said the review of reports from the centres would be concluded either Monday (yesterday) or Tuesday (today). JAMB spokesperson Dr. Fabian Benjamin, who addressed reporters yesterday in Abuja on the issue, attributed the delay in releasing the results to fraudulent practices by some candidates. The UTME was conducted between April 11 and 17. Benjamin said some candidates abused some of the innovations introduced by the board, making it necessary to properly screen the UTME results to ensure that the board does not release the results of a compromised examination. He said: “We are comparing reports from the field, and as soon as we finish – either today or tomorrow – we will commence the process of releasing the results. “We are collecting reports from 687 centres. The results will be released as soon as we finish what we are doing.” The JAMB spokesman also said the board would investigate issues bordering on biometric failure during the conduct of the examination. There were reports of biometric verification challenge in some centres during the examination. Benjamin said the board would look into it as soon as it finishes releasing the UTME results to ensure that candidates with genuine biometric issues are not made to suffer. According to him, if a candidate could be captured during registration, there is nothing stopping the fingerprints of such candidate from being captured during the examination. “As soon as we finish releasing results, we will look into it. If there is any candidate with genuine reason, we will see what we can do. “We will investigate all issues of biometric verification. If we find the cases to be genuine, we will do the needful,” he said.
