The National Judicial Council (NJC) rose from an emergency meeting on Wednesday and elected to be silent on its report on the probe of petitions against suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen and Acting CJN, Ibrahim Muhammad. The NJC, which considered the report of its five-man committee constituted to investigate petitions against Onnoghen and Muhammad, said it has decided to send its report to President Muhammadu Buhari rather than making it public in view of “the nature of the decision reached Its spokesman, Soji Oye said, in a statement on Wednesday, that the NJC refrained from considering the allegation relating to asset declaration involving Onnoghen, “because it’s was subjudice.” The statement reads: “The National Judicial Council reconvened today in an emergency meeting to consider the report of the five-man committee constituted to investigate the allegations of misconduct made against Hon. Mr. Justice W. S. N. Onnoghen, GCON and Hon. Mr. Justice I. T. Muhammad, CFR. “Council decided that the allegations relating to assets declaration that were levelled against Hon. Mr. Justice W. S. N. Onnoghen, GCON were subjudice and therefore abstained from considering them. “Council reached a decision on the petitions written by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and others and conveyed its decision to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. “Council also resolved that, by the nature of the decision reached, it would be inappropriate to publicise it before conveying it to Mr. President.”
