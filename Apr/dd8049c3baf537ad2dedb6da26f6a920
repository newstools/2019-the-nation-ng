Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari yesterday inaugurated Health Promotion Outreach Campaign in Kurfi Local Government, decrying the alarming rate of child mortality rate in the state. He noted that about 900,000 children and mothers die annually in the country. The Health Promotion Outreach Programme is being sponsored by the state’s “Save One Million Lives Programme, supported by donor agencies and the state Ministry of health Masari, who described the National Child Mortality rate as unacceptable, further revealed that the aggregate data showed that the nation only made modest progress in the health sector in the past two decades despite the huge investment by the three levels of government. He said: “We have observed that solution focused on improved inputs has not worked in the past but the availability of many of the health inputs such as health facilities and trained health workers suggested that governance broadly defined impending or binding constraints. “This Save One Million Lives Programme provides us with an opportunity to broadly address governance and the management issues towards ensuring  greater focus on the result; increased accountability; improved measurement and the encouragement of innovation.”
