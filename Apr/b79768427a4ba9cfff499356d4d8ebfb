One person has been confirmed dead and four others injured in a fresh clash between some indigenes of Abuja and soldiers over land at Tungan-Maje, an outskirt town in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Malam Tanko Sani, one of the community leaders who confirmed the incident in an interview with journalists on Wednesday at the scene, said trouble ensued when soldiers forcefully moved into the land and started work without the consent of the indigenes. He said one of the indigenes, a student, Hamza Usman, was killed at the spot by the soldiers for protesting against the action. The community head said four other persons were injured and are receiving treatment in a hospital within the area. He regretted the soldiers had never engaged the community members for a discussion since the disagreement between them started about three years ago. Female and male indigenes of the town blocked the ever busy Zuba â€“ Gwagwalada road to press home their demand. The situation became worst as motorists plying the route were held in gridlock for over five hours before the intervention of some stakeholders. Reacting to the sad development in his palace, the Agora of Zuba, HRH Mohammed Bello, demanded that the indigenes should be compensated, urging them to be calm. Attempts to speak with the military personnel on ground failed as at the time of filling this report. There was also no official statement from officials of the FCTA. All efforts to speak with the FCT police command on the incident were futile as at when filling this report.
