AWARD winning rapper and actor Falz, music entrepreneur Olisa Adibua and Special Projects Consultant Edi Lawani were among a panel that discussed the challenges and future of Nigerian entertainment on MTV Base’s flagship roundtable show, Musicology. Others on the panel include Superstar Disc Jockey, DJ Kaywise; Co-founder/Business strategist operations for Nairabox, Jay Chikezie; Head West Africa ULIve, Bayo Fatoba and  Digital Media Manager for VIMN Africa, Adetola Adekoya. Hosted by VJ Ehiz, the new episode examined the prospects and challenges currently facing events and concerts in Nigeria. Discussing the nonchalant attitude of artists toward their performances, Falz, said: “Generally speaking, I feel standards of events and concerts have gone down. It’s almost like the consumer takes whatever is thrown at them. As a result, artistes have naturally become lazy.” Corroborating Falz, Bayo Fatoba, said: “We believe in creating experiences for artistes at ULive, it now depends on how creative the artiste is, in accepting what you have sold to them.” Creativity, financial constraints, quality control, consumer experience and research were some of the issues discussed at the panel session. And during the discussion about creativity as it concerns performances, promotion and ticket sales, Mr. Adibua asked the following “If from January to November, I see you at everybody’s show popping up here and there, then you say in December you want to do a concert, why would I come to watch you? What’s the value you’re bringing?”
