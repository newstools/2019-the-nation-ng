LEADING social network, Facebook, has restated its commitment to continuously supporting and investing in the development of various Nigerian communities on its platform, including startups, small and medium businesses, creators, and youths through its various empowerment programmes. The event which held at the African Artists Foundation, Victoria Island, Lagos featured multiple training workshops for Nigerian entrepreneurs on how to boost their businesses, use Facebook’s platforms to generate more followers and customers, as well as how to maximize their brands, among others. The company said it is already doing this by equipping future creatives, communities, SMBs and youths with the tools to grow their network on its various platforms, namely Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company said this last week when it hosted an informal evening to mark its two-day pop-up event for Nigerian entrepreneurs, tagged ‘It’s Your Facebook.’ The event also featured a Creators Panel made up of popular comedian Bright Okpocha, aka Basketmouth, Nkechi ‘Ink’ Eze of Asoebi Bella, and Hadiza Lawal founder of Woven Blends, a food and style blog. According to Facebook’s Communications Manager for Sub Saharan Africa, Kezia Anim-Addo, Nigeria is important to Facebook, prompting it to bring its first ever pop-up in Africa to the city of Lagos. “For our users, the event was really a chance to come down and have our experts give them advice and take them through global best practices, and help to answer their questions, whilst interacting directly,” she said. The event was also an opportunity for the company to take users through the some of the services Facebook provides, including how to personalise their newsfeeds, carry out their security settings and lots more. The event had previously been held in Dublin, Cologne and Dubai.
