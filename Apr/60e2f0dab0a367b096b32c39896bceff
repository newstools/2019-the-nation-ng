Knowing the task ahead of him in the third round tie against world number one – China’s Fan Zhendong, Aruna Quadri has said that he has nothing to lose against the Asian as he is hoping to enjoy himself in the tie. The Nigerian described his second round victory against Iran’s Nima Alamian as the toughest match for him in the tournament. “I think this is the toughest match I ever played this year because we both knew ourselves. We trained together at same camp before the competition and I had also told my coach that it is going to be 50-50 game for me. I found it difficult to return his service because I could not understand it but I managed throughout and I am happy winning at this stage,” he said Quadri added: “Against Fan Zhendong, I am going out there to give my best and also enjoy myself as I have nothing to lose against him.”
