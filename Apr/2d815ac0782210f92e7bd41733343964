A coalition of 70 rights group has expressed confidence in the Nigerian Judiciary over the case filed against the Lagos State Governor-elect, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, challenging his eligibility to occupy the exalted office. The coalition, under the aegis of Campaign for Dignity in Governance (CDG), in a statement from its National Convener, Comrade Razaq Olokoba said his group does not entertain any iota of fear that the Judiciary would do a thorough job on the matter enthusing that Sanwo-Olu would come out victorious. According to Olokoba, the rigorous screening the Governor-elect passed through before becoming his party’s candidate that eventually won the governorship race would see him through adding that, “the unshaking trust we have in the Judiciary has given us the confidence that it is Sanwo-Olu that would utilise the mandate freely given to him overwhelmingly by the good people of Lagos State.” The Coalition, through the statement however praised the political maturity and patriotism of the plaintiffs in the case for toeing the legitimate path of honour by channelling their cases through the legal procedure saying, “this shows that they are peace-loving members of the society, who prefer settling grievances the civilised way.” While awaiting the outcome of the matter in court, the coalition hails the people of Lagos on the way they are eagerly awaiting the change of baton on May 29 with anxiety, enthusing that, “the in-coming new actors would not disappoint them. Olokoba therefore urged the people to remain law abiding as usual reminding them that no progress comes out of any chaotic atmosphere.
