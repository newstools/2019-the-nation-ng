THE Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) last night said 39 Boko Haram terrorists have been killed as its troops engaged the insurgents on the fringes of Lake Chad. It, however, said that 20 soldiers were wounded during the operation. Spokesman of the MNJTF, Colonel Timothy Antigha, said in a statement that the wounded soldiers have been airlifted off the zone for treatment. Bodies of the terrorists were shown in the photographs made available by the troops yesterday. Col. Antigha said in a statement: “In continuation of the ongoing Operation YANCIN TAFKI in the Lake Chad area, troops of the MNJTF and national forces yesterday dealt another blow on Boko Haram terrorists. “The terrorists attacked troops’ position in Cross Kaura, however, the vigilant and gallant MNJTF and national troops overwhelmed the terrorists, killing 39 and capturing equipment in the counter-attack. “Twenty soldiers, who were wounded in action have been airlifted out of the area of operation and are receiving adequate medical attention.”
