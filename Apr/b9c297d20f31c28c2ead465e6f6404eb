Super Eagles’ and Middleborough of England midfielder, Mikel John Obi has blamed ill-luck for his side’s recent drop in form after they went down 0-1 to Bristol City at home on Tuesday night, AOIFootball.com reports. The Eagles captain, who has quickly established himself as a fan favourite at the Riverside, told the club’s website after the loss to Bristol that it was unexplainable the way they fall to defeat but believes the squad can still rally round and turn results in their favour. “For the last three games, I don’t understand how some of the chances go in. It’s unbelievable. Sometimes football is very cruel like that. We come out to try and put in a good performance and make sure we don’t disappoint the fans. We keep getting these chances. “The lads are doing everything possible so that we take the lead when we’re on top, get one or two and then we can settle, but it’s just not coming. But we have to keep on going,” Mikel concluded.
