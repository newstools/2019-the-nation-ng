All Progressives Congress (APC) House of Representatives members from Niger State have resolved to back Femi Gbajabiamila for the Speaker. Although the federal legislator representing Chachanga Constituency, Niger State, Mohammed Bago,  is in the race, they said their decision was based on party supremacy. At a meeing held in Government House, Minna, the state capital, at the instance of Governor  Abubakar Sani Bello,  the senators from the state also resolved to back Dr. Ahmed Lawan for Senate President. Niger State APC chairman Jibril Imam said the party is supreme, urging members to remain united. He said: “Going by what happened during the tenure of the 8th National Assembly, the party at all levels decided to reach a middle ground to enable us present a formidable front on the matter.” Imam said the meeting was a follow up to an earlier one by  APC chairmen and governors from the North Central states in Abuja, adding that the Minna meeting was attended by serving and elected members, who unanimously adopted the two candidates. He said the endorsement was to avert the reoccurrence of the experience in the 8th Assembly, which was unpalatable and slowed down the progress of the nation in the last four years. Imam added: “We are loyal party members and have resolved  to toe the position of the party by endorsing Senator Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan as the Senate President of the 9th Assembly and Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the 9th Assembly. “Our experience in the 8th Assembly is not palatable and it has  slowed down our progress in the last four years and we don’t want a repeat of that”. Speaking on behalf of the legislators Abdullahi Mahmud representing Agaie/Lapai Constituency, said the adoption of Lawan and Gbajabiamila was an affirmation of party supremacy.
