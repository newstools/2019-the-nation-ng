The Association of Vulnerable Children, Widows and Elderly Home Operators in Africa has condemned the physical abuse of children in orphanage homes across the country.. The association called for the prosecution of anyone caught abusing or molesting any child. It’s Africa President, Princess Ononiwu stated this during its national meeting and inauguration ceremony of members of Nigeria branch in Abuja. According to her, a lot of physical and emotional abuse of children are taking place in most orphanage homes in the country. She urged the Federal Government to monitor activities of home operators through the Social Welfare Department of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development. Mrs. Ononiwu said the association is ready to collaborate with the government to bring perpetrators to justice. She said: “One of our aims is to monitor, watch and report to the government about what is happening in orphanage and elderly homes. A lot of homes are doing what government said we should not do. “We are operators. We know who is who. We know those who are doing the right thing and we know those who are just doing it for the money. “This association is trying everything possible to make sure we go into the field, fish out some of these homes that are giving orphanages bad names.” The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Coordinator of the association, Mrs. Chinenye Fubara, said she is moved by the passion to improve the lives of orphans. “I want to see the lives of children in orphanages being improved all over Africa. We have put up programs to visit homes, to create necessary awareness. We have plans to sanitise so many homes so that the operators will know what they are supposed to do. “We are also planning to organize quiz competition for children in orphanage homes in the FCT. We want to bring them together so that they can brainstorm and improve their lives,” she added.
