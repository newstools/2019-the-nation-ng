THE governorship candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) in Rivers State, Biokpmabo Awara, has urged the Federal Government to bring to book the perpetrators and sponsors of cultism in the state. He made the call yesterday in an online statement. His words: “I condemn in its entirety, the killings taking place in different parts of Rivers State, as a result of cult-related activities. “It is quite unfortunate that our dear Rivers State will be experiencing this level of insecurity at this point in time, when other states are working very hard to enhance their economies and promote development”. “The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari should come to the rescue of Rivers people, since it is now obvious that the Rivers State government cannot  address insecurity in our state. “Inability of the Nyesom Wike’s adminstration to meaningfully engage the youths, by providing employment opportunities for them, has snowballed into the state of insecurity in Rivers State.”
