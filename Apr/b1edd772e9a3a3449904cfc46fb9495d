Fuji Music Legend, King Wasiu Ayinde Mashal, popularly known as K1 De Ultimate has promised to sponsor the education of kid artist, Oluwatobi Ilelolawa, the 12 year-old Primary Six pupil, who sketched President Muhammadu Buhari’s portrait with a pen recently. News of the little boy’s creativity got to the foremost musician, following a Facebook post by a journalist, Raheem Akingbolu. K1, through his publicist, Kunle Rasheed, reached out to the writer, saying he was touched by the story of the boy. Thus, he offered  to sponsor the promising artist’s post-primary education to university level. K1 described the boy as a raw talent that must be guided, supported and not allowed to waste. He said: “I was touched when the story was brought to my notice and I see it as one of those things one can do to impact the society.  Education is key to success and who knows the boy we are talking about may be a governor or President in the making. He may become another Ben Enwonwu, Bruce Onobrakepya, Wole Soyinka or an international Artist of repute in the future. If the society fails to give him the needed support now, posterity will not forgive us. This is the time to lift a hand and groom a talent for posterity.” Rasheed has assured that arrangements are being made  to introduce the promising artist  to his new benefactor and perfect ways through which his mentorship and sponsorship would  be handled.
