A 28-year-old divorcee, Bilkisu Aminu, on Monday dragged her ex-husband, Muhammad Jibril, to a Sharia Court I siting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna, over alleged denial of her pregnancy. The case was earlier mentioned on April 1 when the Judge, Dahiru Lawal, ordered the wife to go for a pregnancy test to ascertain the pregnancy. Lawal, after going through the pregnancy test result confirmed the pregnancy and ordered the parties to appear before the court on April 15 for further hearing. Earlier, the complainant, who resides on Benin Street, Kaduna, told the court that she got married to the defendant for three months before they were divorced. “He divorced me on Feb. 6, but after few days at home, I went to a private hospital and the doctor confirmed that I am pregnant. “I called Jibril to inform him of the pregnancy; he told me that he will visit me which he never did,” she said. Jibril, 32, who resides along Zaria Road in Kaduna told the court that he was not responsible for the pregnancy. He said he had no sex with his divorced wife for over two months during their three-month marriage. “We had series of misunderstanding within the few months of our marriage, we did not have sex at all while in the third month of our marriage,” Jibril said.
