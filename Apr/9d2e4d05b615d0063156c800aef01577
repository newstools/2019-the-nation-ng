An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Tuesday discharged a 36-year-old commercial bus driver, Charles Inibu, charged with robbing a man of two mobile phones while armed with a dangerous weapon. The Magistrate, Mrs M. O. Ope-Agbe, discharged the defendant based on  advice by the state Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). Inibu was arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy  and armed robbery. His plea was not taken by the court,  which consequently remanded him pending the advice. At the resumed hearing on Tuesday, the magistrate read the DPP’s submission which advised the court to discharge the defendant on the grounds of  insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Ope-Agbe, therefore, discharged the defendant. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sgt. Cyriacus Nwosu,  told the court that the defendant committed the alleged offences on Feb. 8, at 4.00p.m., on Lekki-Epe Expressway in Eti-Osa LGA of Lagos State. He said that the defendant conspired with one other person still at large and robbed a road user of two mobile phones, worth N55, 000. The prosecutor said that the defendant, while driving a commercial bus marked AAA 9324 A, armed himself with a screw driver and robbed one Mr Toki Omotayo of Nokia and Samsung phones. The alleged offences contravene Sections 297 (2) and 299 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 NAN.
