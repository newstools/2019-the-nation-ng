As part of burial rites for the late Olowo of Owo , Oba Folagbade Olateru-Olagbegi, the community has banned burying of corpses, burial ceremonies and beating of drums until  his remains are buried in line with the tradition. According to intermittent radio announcement by all the High Chiefs in Owo, the community said there is an adverse effect for anybody who violates the order. The ban is expected to last for less than 21 days. The Owo Community Chiefs urged members of the public to comply with the traditional directive in their own interest Olowo’s palace has continued to receive sympathizers and well-wishers. People came to either confirm the sudden news on Oba Olateru-Olagbegi or to pay their respect and commiserate with the Chiefs, family and elders. Already, as part of traditional burial rites for the monarch, all trees in and around the Oba Market and the palace have been cut. The relocation of the market to Ogwata had taken place pending the installation of a new Olowo. The Olubola of Owo, Chief Olusola Ogunleye, who is also the Secretary to the late monarch, described the demise of Olowo as sudden and regrettable to the entire community.
