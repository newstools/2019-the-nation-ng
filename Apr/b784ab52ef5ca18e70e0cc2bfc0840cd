A prophet and a prophetess were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly forcing a 16-year-old domestic staff to swallow an iron cross. Kehinde Salami, 25, and Yetunde Akinola, 42, are facing a four-count charge of conspiracy, breach of the peace, false pretences and attempted murder before Chief Magistrate T. A, Ojo. They pleaded not guilty. The defendants allegedly made the maid to swallow the cross in order to cleanse her of witchcraft. Prosecuting Sergeant Kenrich Nomayo said the defendants committed the offence on March 24 at their Ifako-Ijaiye, Lagos home. He alleged that they attempted to kill their victim by forcing her to swallow the cross against her wish. The defendants, Nomayo added, conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace when they claimed to see a vision in which the complainant was alleged to be a witch. He said the defendants gave the complainant the cross to swallow on the pretext that they were delivering her from witchcraft. The state of the complainant’s health, he said,  was unknown, as she is in an undisclosed hospital. Chief Magistrate Ojo granted them N200,000 bail with one surety each in the like sum. He ordered that they be remanded in Kirikiri Prisons until they meet their bail conditions. Ojo ordered that the case file be duplicated and sent to Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. The case continues on April 30.
