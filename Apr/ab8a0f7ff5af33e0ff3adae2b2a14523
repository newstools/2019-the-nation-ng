A self-proclaimed bureau de change operator, Edwin Nwankwo, was yesterday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, for allegedly obtaining $15,500 under the guise of supplying the naira equivalent. Nwankwo, 51, is standing trial on a three-count charge of fraud and stealing before Mr. B. I. Bakare. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh alleged that the defendant and his accomplices on the run, committed the offences last November in Lagos. He alleged that the defendant fraudulently obtained $15,500 from Abdulmalik Yunusa, “on the pretext of being a bureau de change operator who would supply the naira equivalent of the dollar once his dollar account was credited”. Mameh said the defendant knew that his representation was false, but deceived the complainant into crediting his dollar account with the money. “The defendant received the money, but did not give the naira equivalent of the money,” the prosecutor said. The offences, he added, contravened sections 287(9), 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Nwankwo pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Bakare granted him N750,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on May 22.
