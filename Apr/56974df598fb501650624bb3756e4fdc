Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode said yesterday that synergy was the key to ultimate performance in the public service. He said harnessing the benefits of team building and synergy to maximise performance in the civil service should not be underestimated. “Civil servants need to be trained and retrained so that working together, the output of the civil service will be increased,” Ambode added. Speaking at a two-day training for civil servants in Ikeja, the governor restated his administration’s appreciation of the benefits of training and retraining and their impact on the performance and delivery of services by civil servants. The governor, represented by Establishments, Training and Pensions Commissioner Dr. Benson Oke, said synergy happens when one plus one equals ten or a hundred or even a thousand. He said it was the result when two or more respectful human beings determined to go beyond their preconceived ideas to meet a great challenge. “Synergy is better than my way or your way. It is our way”, Ambode said. He said synergies were not only about cost reduction, but could also be access to markets, exchange of products, avoiding overlaps and exchange of best practices. “Synergy is also described as bonus that is achieved when things work together harmoniously. Synergy is everywhere in nature. Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much,” the governor said. Lagos Business School executive Prof. Pat Utomi said the training was about synergy, to enable civil servants increase their productivity and become result-oriented. He hailed the government for deeming it fit to train the workers. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Establishment, Training and Pension, Mrs. Rhoda Ayinde, congratulated the participants for being counted worthy as part of the programme. She advised them to use the knowledge gained from the training to improve the performance of the civil service.
