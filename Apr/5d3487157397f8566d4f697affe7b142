The National Auditor of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Pastor Jegede  Kehinde, has advised party members to co-operate with the National Chairman of the party, Dr Ike  Oye, who became the leader of the party due to the crisis that erupted after its primaries. He appealed to party members to support the chairman in the interest of the party. He said Dr Oye had built on the foundation laid down by his predecessor, Senator Umeh, while Dr Oye’s tenure had recorded victory in Anambra, Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba states. Pastor Kehinde further said Dr Oye had succeeded in transforming the APGA from a regional party to a national party.
