Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano and the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) have congratulated Air Peace on the delivery of its third Boeing 777 aircraft. Obiano urged the Federal Government to Air Peace with a flag carrier status. Obiano, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, described Air Peace as Nigeria’s fastest growing and most ambitious airline in history. He said: “This is a more pragmatic step to take than the rumoured current attempt in some quarters to make the President Muhammadu Buhari administration establish a state-owned airline, despite the terrible record of Nigeria Airways and the government’s wise suspension of it last September. “There is no way any state-owned or promoted airline can enhance Nigeria’s reputation in the world that Air Peace is not doing, and will continue to do with greater efficiency and results.” The National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) said the airline’s third Boeing 777 aircraft would transform the experience of the travelling public. A March 28 congratulatory letter by NUATE president, Ben Nnabue addressed to Air Peace Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Allen Onyema, reads: “We believe that this new vessel will usher in a luxury experience to the travelling public as safety is already guaranteed.” Air Peace has so far acquired four Boeing 777 aircraft, three of which have been delivered. Since it commenced operations in 2014, the carrier has increased its fleet size to a total of about 37 aircraft.
