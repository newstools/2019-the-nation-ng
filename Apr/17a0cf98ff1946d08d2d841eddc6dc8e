Sergio Aguero scored another crucial goal for Manchester City as his strike in a 1-0 win at Burnley moved the defending champions back above Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table. City were frustrated for long periods at Turf Moor on Sunday but they found the breakthrough in the 63rd minute, Aguero scoring his 20th Premier League goal of the season. Aguero’s strike evaded the desperate efforts of Burnley defender Matt Lowton to clear off the line, with City’s 12th straight league victory moving Pep Guardiola’s side a point above Liverpool with two games remaining. The Argentina attacker has become the second player in Premier League history to score 20 or more times in five consecutive seasons, with his latest goal keeping City on track for the title. Goal.Com
