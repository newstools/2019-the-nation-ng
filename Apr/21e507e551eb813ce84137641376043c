The Managing Director of R.A. One Enterprises, Rotimi Omolekan, yesterday appeared before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court for  alleged N741, 777 theft. Omolekan, 44, was arraigned by the police before Magistrate B.I. Bakare on a two-count charge of obtaining credit facility under false pretence, stealing and issuance of a dud cheque. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Ingobo Emby alleged that the defendant committed the offence in June 2013, at Projects Micro Finance Bank, 61, Marina Street, Lagos Island. The court heard that the defendant applied for a credit facility of N741,777 in 2013 from the bank under the guise of repaying the loan at a stipulated time. The defendant allegedly failed to repay the loan, but issued a cheque for N354,960 to the bank as part payment for the loan. The cheque was rejected on presentation due to insufficient funds in the defendant’s account. Magistrate Bakare granted Omolekan N400,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on April 18.
