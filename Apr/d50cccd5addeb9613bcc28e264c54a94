The National Assembly leadership has released details of its 2018 budget. Findings show that the release of the fiscal document, hitherto held secret, was in line with the directive of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who asked Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolari, to release the document for public view.
