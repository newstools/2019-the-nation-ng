Enugu State Governor and Governor-elect, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has urged Christians and indeed all Nigerians, to take advantage of Christ’s resurrection, which Easter symbolizes, to sustain their abiding faith in God and promote peace, love, unity and virtues that enhance the progress of the country. In his Easter message, Ugwuanyi noted that the observation of 40 days of Lent through fasting, abstinence, praying and charity in memory of Christ’s suffering, death and resurrection, “reinvigorates the spiritual strength of Christians and God’s amazing grace for salvation of mankind”. While wishing the good  people of Enugu State and indeed all Nigerians a happy Easter celebration, Ugwuanyi reiterated his resolve to continue to serve with the fear of God, and urged them to remain committed to the core values of their religious belief which centres on peace, unity, love and progress.
