Lagos State Governor-elect Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday at the Lagos State Gubernatorial Election Petition Tribunal in Ikeja filed his defence to two petitions challenging his March 9 election victory. Sanwo-Olu, who arrived at about 11:14am alongside Deputy Governor-elect Obafemi Hamzat, was confident of victory. The petitions were filed by Chief Owolabi Salis of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and Prof. Ifagbemi Awamaridi of the Labour Party (LP). Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat were accompanied by a former Minister for Defence and chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Chief Demola Seriki. After filing his response to both petitions, the governor-elect also filed his defence. He noted that although he was confident of victory, it was the Tribunal’s duty to determine if the challengers’ petitions had any merit. Sanwo-Olu said: “What we came here to do is to put an official deposition to the challenge by two gubernatorial candidates. “We are certainly confident because Lagosians have spoken, the people went out on March 9 to cast their votes. “It was devoid of any form of incident, there was not one incident reported officially. We trust that the tribunal will do its job well and Lagosians will be happy. He added: “It is a process that all of us must submit ourselves to; that is why we are here today, and we are confident that the tribunal will do its job well.” He promised that his administration would undertake judicial reforms for speedy administration of justice. “Lagos has championed judicial reforms in the last 20 years, and my administration will not be different.
