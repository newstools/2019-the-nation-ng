The Italian was dismissed by referee Kevin Friend and fourth official Roger East in the 94th minute of the match, which was marred by several angry exchanges between the two benches and the match officials, culminating in a mass brawl in front of the dugout at full-time. Sources told ESPN FC Sarri’s anger boiled over after repeatedly being called a “s— Italian” by several members of the Burnley bench. Sarri has until 6 p.m. on Friday to respond to the misconduct charge, but the FA’s investigation of other incidents that occurred during the game is ongoing. Chelsea and Burnley are likely to both be charged with failing to control their players and staff, while members of the visiting club could also face disciplinary action if they are found to have abused Sarri. Details of what was said to Sarri were passed to Friend after the match, and are expected to feature in his report.
