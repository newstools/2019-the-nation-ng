Anglican Bishop of Awka Diocese, Anambra State, Rt. Rev. Alexander Chibuzor Ibezim, has raised alarm over incessant reckless killings in Nigeria. He stressed the sacredness of blood of human beings, which he said was not created by God to be wasted like fowls as daily done in Nigeria. Speaking Saturday at the Cathedral Church of St Faith, Awka, Ibezim warned that spilled innocent blood of Nigerians  would soon seek vengeance. He said, “Blood is sacred and human being is created in the image of God. The blood of those killed will ask for vengeance.”
While calling for an end to the killings, kidnapping and other atrocities, the cleric insisted that abuse of human blood is not only unbiblical, but unethical. “Government at all levels should take full responsibilities of protecting her citizens in its totality to ensure that peace and tranquility prevail in the society,” he noted. Ibezim further called on christians to re-examine their lives to ensure they were still in faith, proclaim Christ as a Messiah and demonstrate servant hood and humility in all they did. “The death and resurrection of Christ is the basis for Christianity. Easter gives us hope of resurrection, victory and life after death,” he added.
