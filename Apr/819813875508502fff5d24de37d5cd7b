The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State has kicked against a bill passed by the House of Assembly awarding life pensions to lawmakers. The party described the bill as unjust, ungodly and self-serving, saying it had set the public pulse racing. Publicity Secretary Doifie Buokoribo said it was unsympathetic for the lawmakers to seek to enhance their own lives at the expense of the people living in pain and penury. Buokoribo described the life pension bill as an unspeakable crime against our people. According to him, the party was making efforts to enthrone a regime of better life for the people of Bayelsa. He said: “We say this latest move by the House of Assembly is avaricious, wicked, and insensitive. By proposing such a law, the lawmakers have merely portrayed themselves as a people who feel no concern for the feelings of their suffering constituents. “They have once again confirmed that they are in cahoots with the executive in the serial impoverishment of the people of Bayelsa State. “APC advises the legislature to withdraw the obnoxious pension bill and avoid the appalling crime against the people. “If the legislature refuses to heed this solemn advice, we appeal to Governor Seriake Dickson, if he is still in touch with his essential humanity, to refuse to assent to the bill when it is transmitted to him. “Failing this, the party calls on the people to embark on a campaign of peaceful resistance against the rogue assembly and the poverty regime of Governor Dickson.”
