The Oyo State Ministry of Works and Transport has reacted to what it described as  ‘ lies peddled by the commentators in the Freshly Pressed programme on Fresh FM’ yesterday.  This was as regards to a fire incident Ile Marun, Iwo Road, Ibadan. The ministry said the information broadcast by the Ibadan radio programme’s commentators were inaccurate. According to the ministry, the commentators were not on ground during the inferno and only came after the fire had been put off. The ministry, in a press statement said the commentators  ” who were not on ground until the fire was completely put off and who did not know the efforts of the State  Fire Service at putting off the inferno, heaped the blame of the incident on the State Fire Service, claiming the State Fire Service said there was no water and chemical resulting into a conflagration. The moderator and analysts even went as far as castigating the person of the Governor of Oyo State for not indicting the Fire Service. The questions are; with what did the State Fire Service put out the fire if there was no water and chemical?  Did any of the analysts and pressmen confront the State Fire Service with the information before coming to damning conclusions and rushing to press? The truth is that as soon as the information got to us about a tanker’s explosion at Ile Marun, Iwo road, the officers from Gbagi Fire Station were deployed to the scene because of the closeness to the place. They were to be complemented by officers from the State Fire Headquarters. The two Fire Stations went to the scene with 52,500 litres of water with which the effect of the inferno was mitigated.”
