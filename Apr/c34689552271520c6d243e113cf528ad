All Progressives Congress (APC) National Publicity Secretary Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu has said the party has modalities for dealing with members that goes against its Constitution. “I think you should avail yourself with the party constitution. It has procedures for handling such things. A member is just making suggestion and you do not expect the party to go against its own rules,” he said. Article 21 of the party’s constitution identifies offences against the party to include: anti-party activities or any conduct which is likely to embarrass or have adverse effect on the party, or bring the party into hatred, contempt, ridicule or disrepute; disobedience or negligence in carrying out lawful directives of the party and any act of impersonation of party offices or it’s holders.” It also lists as offence, flouting the rules, regulations and decisions of the party, engaging in dishonest practices, thuggery, continuously being absent from meetings to which he or she is invited without reasonable cause, carrying out anti-party or other activities which tend to disrupt the peaceful, lawful and efficient organisation of the party or which are inconsistent with the aims and objectives of the party. Article 21(d) however states punishment for members found guilty to include reprimand, censure, fine, debarment from holding party office, removal from office, suspension from the party and expulsion from the party, among others. It also states that “where it is proposed to expel a member of the executive committee, political office holder or a member of a legislative house from membership of the party, such a proposal shall be submitted to the National Executive Committee (NEC) which after deliberation on the matter, may confirm or reject the proposal”. Issa-Onilu said that in all cases, the party will be guided by its own rules and will not do anything out side the laws.
