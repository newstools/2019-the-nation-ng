The National Pension Commission (PenCom) said it has put stringent measures in place to prevent payment of pension to fraudsters. Its Acting Director-General, Mrs Aisha Dahir-Umar who gave the assurance in an interview with The Nation said the administration and payments of retirement benefits under the Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2004, as repealed by PRA 2014, 2014 is fool proof. She said the Commission also checks to confirm that information submitted to it are correct before granting approval for payment to the beneficiary. She said: “The Regulation on the Administration for Retirement and Terminal Benefits, has spelt out procedures and put in place controls that must be followed by any Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holder, before he or she can access the account. “The regulation stipulates that the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) must collect documents and confirm it against their database. The documents to be collected include valid means of identification, banker’s confirmation of account details; official notice of retirement from RSA holder’s employer; last pay slip or any other evidence of total annual remuneration; declaration of age and introduction letter from the employer. PenCom checks all data submitted against the Contributors Registration System (CRS), to confirm that it is complete and accurate. The commission then grants approval to the PFAs for payment to the beneficiaries.
