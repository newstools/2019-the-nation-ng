•Senate President felicitates with Christians Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki has urged Nigerians to imbibe the value of sacrificing in the interest of the country, as demonstrated by Jesus Christ, whose selfless service to humanity is being commemorated across the world this Easter period. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the Senate President congratulated Christians in Nigeria and across the world as they celebrate the Easter festivities. Saraki said: “I believe that our country will become better if we all commit ourselves to selfless service and making sacrifices, both at the individual and collective levels. I also believe that Christians, like their counterparts in other faiths, have spent the Lenten season to stand in the gap for Nigeria in particular and humanity in general. The prayers and fasting of Nigerians have been the bulwark against all the centrifugal and centripetal forces threatening to pull our nation down. We must not relent but only need to add discipline, obedience to law and more intense patriotism to our attitude. “I congratulate Christians and all Nigerians for the demonstration of faith in our common heritage through fasting, prayer, sober reflection and sacrifices in the interest of the country for which we now commemorate the death and resurrection of Christ.”
