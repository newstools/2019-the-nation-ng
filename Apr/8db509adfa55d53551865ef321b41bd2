A strange fire on Easter Sunday destroyed goods and property worth millions of naira at shops in Alagbado, Lagos. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained. Ten shops were burnt down at Egbado Road, off Dalemo, by Kunlex bus stop, Alagbado, Lagos. An eyewitness, Aare Kunle Sekoni, said the inferno started around 1am, adding that fire fighters came promptly to put it out. The Nation, however, learnt that before the officials arrived, the fire had wrecked havoc. Although items worth over N10million were destroyed, nobody died. One of the owners of the affected shops, simply called Mama J Boy, who sells bags of rice, groundnut oil and sugar, said she stocked the shop recently with goods and lost all to the fire. A barber, Success and a chemist shop owner, Ejime, said they lost equipment and goods.
