Tricycle operators have been banned from operating beyond 10pm in Asaba and surrounding environment. Delta State Commissioner of Police Adeleke Adeyinka vowed to arrest any tricyclist who flouts the order. “The command is reinforcing the order owing to the prevailing security situation in the state,” he said. A statement by the spokesman, Chuks Oresewezie, said men of the command on patrol duties have been ordered to impound any tricycle found operating in Asaba metropolis and environs beyond 10pm. The statement solicited the understanding of Deltans, and assured the public of the police commitment to their safety and security. The restriction on commercial tricyclists may not be unconnected with the rising spate of violent attacks on police personnel. There has been an upsurge in violent crimes lately, especially on police personnel, leading to deaths and loss of service rifles. Three policemen were attacked at a check point at Inter-bau roundabout in Asaba and the hoodlums stole their service rifles.
