TWO men, Michael Hastrup, 24, and Bamilare Afolabi, 21,  were yesterday arraigned at an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court for alleged membership of a cult known as “Eiye Confraternity.” Prosecuting Inspector Lucky Ihiehie said the defendants committed the offence on March 19 at Ferry, Oworonshoki, Lagos. He alleged that on that day, some policemen  arrested Hastrup, who had been on the wanted list of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Oworonshoki Division. “Hastrup was sighted at Ferry and upon information, the police raided the place and arrested him with Afolabi, who was in possession of Indian hemp,” Ihiehie said. The duo pleaded not guilty. Magistrate H. B. Mogaji granted them N200, 000 bail,  with two sureties each in the like sum. She said the sureties must live within the court’s jurisdiction and be employed. The case continues on November 20.
