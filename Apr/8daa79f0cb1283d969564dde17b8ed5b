A Chief Magistrates Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State has ordered the remand in prison custody of two teenagers, Prince Ikiriko ’19’ and Johnson Chidinma ’19’ for alleged armed robbery. The duo and others presently at large allegedly robbed Elder Christian Abbey and Ndubueze Sunday of a sum cash of N23, 000 while armed with guns. They also allegedly dispossessed their victims of their phones valued at over N30, 000. The suspects are alleged to have belonged to a cult group called ‘Dey-gbam’ between 2016 to April, 2019 at Elechi Beach, Urualla and Afikpo waterfronts in Diobu, Port Harcourt. They committed the offence on April 6, 2019 at Afikpo waterfronts and Urualla, Diobu, Port Harcourt respectively. The five-count charge which included armed robbery and cultism was not read to them because the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter hence; they were not allowed to take a plea. They were represented by a lawyer who prayed the court to assume jurisdiction and grant bail to the suspects. Magistrate Sokari Andrew-Jaja declined and ordered that the council should address the court on the issue of bail. He also ordered that the suspects be remanded in prison custody and adjourned till May 9, 2019 for address.
