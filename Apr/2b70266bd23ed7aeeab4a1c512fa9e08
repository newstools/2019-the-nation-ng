Two University of Lagos (UNILAG) students yesterday appeared at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly attempting to rape their course mate. Ikedi Okpanlanedu, 21, and Samuel Idongesit, 20, are also accused  of conspiracy,  assault, impersonation and threatening violence. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye alleged that the undergraduates invited their course mate, a make-up artiste, to a hotel room and attempted to rape her. She said the defendants committed the offence on April 1, at Peace Land Hotel, Fola Agoro, Shomolu, Lagos. Olaluwoye said the defendants promised to introduce the make-up artiste to someone, who needed her service. She alleged that the defendants attempted to rape her on arrival at the hotel room. “My lord, they strangled her because she called for help. A hotel worker, Mr. Ohaeri Godlove, who heard her screaming, called the guard. “Okpanlanedu claimed to be an Army personnel and threatened to stab her with the knife he was holding, if she did not cooperate with them. “The knife was recovered from the crime scene. We intend to tender it in evidence,” Olaluwoye added. The defendants pleaded not guilty. They were granted N200,000 bail with two sureties each in the like sum by Chief Magistrate Peter Ojo. The sureties must be employed and possess evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on June 26.
