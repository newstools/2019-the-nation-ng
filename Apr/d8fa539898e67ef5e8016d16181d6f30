POPULAR Nigerian street music singer, Adekunle Temitope, aka Small Doctor, has been unveiled as the new brand ambassador for the country’s fast growing bet outfit, Winners Golden Bet. Speaking at the unveiling which held at the company’s new headquarter in Lagos, Executive Director of WGB, Olabanji Sulaiman, said the partnership signals the beginning of an interesting brand relationship between the fast growing bet outfit – Winners Golden Bet and the national pride and singing sensation, Small Doctor. “The base of Small Doctor’s music is grassroot and our business is too grassroot. You also remember he sang ‘Aja n sare’ which also relates to our business, the ‘Dog Race’ which is part of our product. So it makes more sense for us to come together and have Small Doctor as our brand ambassador to put the company on the next level. This will be a longtime partnership and the deal is something satisfying for both parties,” Sulaiman said. Immediately after Small Doctor signed a contract with the betting company, he declared: “Firstly, I’m happy to come on board as a Brand Ambassador of Winners Golden Bet. My prayer is that this new partnership will yield positive results for both parties. It is a new beginning of greatness for every one of us. “Being a brand ambassador and an entertainer as well, definitely we will give hope to the upcoming artists, make them to strive for the best too and keep their head up. To give them the zeal to bring out the best of themselves. Also give the industry itself more room for others to get bigger deals and endorsements,” the entertainer said.
