Joy Chioma Oruh, the winner of the grand prize of a three-bedroom bungalow in the “win-a-home-today” campaign by Home Lottery Limited, has been given the keys to her apartment. In the presence of her family, friends, journalists and organisers of the event, Oruh, an accountant by profession, was all smiles as she was presented the house in Gold Estate at Ayobo, a suburb in Lagos. Oruh, who was skeptical when she was called that she was the star prize winner during the draw conducted on April 1, 2019, has now faced the reality of graduating from a tenant to a landlord in Lagos. “Today is the happiest day of my life,” she said. “Honestly, it’s like a dream. Since the 1st of April and now, I am still in shock. I played it last year and even forgot about it. When I got the call, at first I thought it was April fool’s day joke. I cut the call but they called me back that I was live on air and it wasn’t a prank. Later I got a call to come to their office for verification and all that. I am so shocked; so excited.” Now she wants others to experience same feelings. “I want more people to play; it’s real,” she said. “I want them to key into this exercise and achieve their dreams of becoming a landlord in Lagos, like me. I want everybody to know this real. I sent ‘home’ to 718. I think I did it about three or four times. And with N1, 000, I am getting a house.” It’s also a case of ‘the more, the merrier’ for Oladayo Oyelaja, the: lead advocate of Dreamview Enterprise an activation agency for the home lottery limited operators of “win a home today” lottery scheme “A home of our own is something we all desire and deserve. With this presentation, I am sure more people will be playing. Ms. Joy is now an advocate of the brand. We expect her to tell everyone she knows about us. We want to put a smile to more faces.” The next draw comes up in   July 1, 2019.
