The Ilupeju Lions Club has sponsored an eye surgery for three-year-old Alimat Ibrahim. The President of the club, Babatunde Raji, said Alimat had not seen since she was born. He said the gesture, which costs N750,000, was to enable Alimat regain her sight. Speaking at the weekend, at Eye Foundation Hospital, Ikeja, after the successful operation on Alimat, Raji said the period which the family came to the club and when the operation took place was within three weeks. Lions Club District Governor for District 404 B2 Nigeria, Dupe Dada appreciated Lions Club Ilupeju for the gesture. “Our major priority is the vision and this is our core area particularly when it comes to medical. We believe that the government cannot do it all alone and that is why we take it as our own responsibility to save souls. At the same time, we can only implore other persons to come and join us to help the needy,” he said. Alimat mother, Khadijat Ibrahim, a trader, thanked the club for coming to their aid. “We have been to different hospitals but we were told nothing could be done until we got to Eye Foundation Hospital that assured us that Alimat would regain her sight. “Since birth, Alimat could not see with the eyes. Lions Club Ilupeju came to our rescue and we appreciated what they have done,” she said. Former Chief Editing Assistant, Lagos State Ministry of Information and Grandfather to Alimat, Taiwo Ishola said the family had been to different hospitals and had done several tests but to no avail. He said they had spent over N200,000 and were eventually referred to Eye Foundation but the family could not afford the cost of the operation. “I wrote letters for financial assistance to several individuals and organisations but all were to no avail. As a family, we appreciate what this club has done and we thank God that the operation was successful,” he said.
