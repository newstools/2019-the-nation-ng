Five-time world champions, Nigeria flew out of Abuja on Wednesday on their way to Tanzania to take part in the 13th Africa U-17 Cup of Nations taking place in that country from 14th – 28th April. Players and officials were seen off at the airport by Acting President of NFF, Seyi Akinwunmi, who charged them to do the nation proud by lifting the U-17 AFCON trophy in Dar es Salaam on the April 28th. The Golden Eaglets secured a ticket to Tanzania after winning the WAFU B U-17 Tournament in the Niger Republic in September last year and will be aiming to be one of Africa’s four flag-bearers at the FIFA U-17 World Cup finals already scheduled for Brazil later this year. Nigeria, Africa’s U-17 football powerhouse, edged fellow juggernauts Ghana on penalties in Niamey to secure their slot in Tanzania, and are in the same Group A as hosts Tanzania, Uganda and Angola.
