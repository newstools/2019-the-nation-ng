The Provost, Federal College of Education Eha-Amufu (FCEE), Enugu State, Dr. Pauline Ikwuegbu, has warned the students to shun cultism and anti-social behaviours or face expulsion. Ikwuegbu spoke during the matriculation of 1,700 National Certificate of Education (NCE) students and the 311 who were the first batch of the school’s degree programmes. The school is awarding degrees in affiliation with the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). She said: “Any student caught involved in cultism or any anti-social behaviour will be expelled. Remain focused on your studies as the school authority will not spare any student involved in cultism or anti-social behaviours. “The college will give students necessary encouragement and support to enable them actualise their dreams. “The 25th matriculation is unique in two ways – this is the first time we are matriculating the first batch of degree students who will be awarded UNN degrees on graduation, and the first time a female provost will be conducting matriculation since the college was established in 1981. “FCEE is grateful to UNN for accepting the affiliation request and to the National University Commission (NUC) for approving the college to run degree programmes. “Workers, students and management are excited on this historic achievement.” Prof. Ozumba, who was represented by the Dean, Faculty of Education, Prof. Dominic Ngwoke, urged the students to be focused as UNN was known for academic excellence nationally and internationally. “UNN has zero tolerance for cultism, exam malpractice and violence, and will not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against students who violate its rules and regulations. “The institution is known nationally and internationally for academic excellence, so avoid anything that will dent its reputation. “UNN praised the provost and management of the college for their efforts in meeting terms and conditions for the affiliation,” he said.
