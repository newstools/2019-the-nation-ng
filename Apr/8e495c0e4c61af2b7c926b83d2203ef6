THE Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) will today begin clampdown on petrol dealers hoarding or diverting products in Ekiti State. The NSCDC, Ekiti Command, said it would not allow those he described as unscrupulous dealers to create artificial scarcity in the state over  anticipation of a rise in official pump prices. Governor Kayode Fayemi  on Friday issued similar threat against some petrol dealers found to be hoarding fuel. This situation has forced motorists to engage in panic buying since Friday. The development had also caused long queues in filling stations across the state and hike in the pump price in some stations to N160 per litre. Speaking with reporters  in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, the command’s  Commandant, Mr. Solomon Iyamu, said he had instructed anti-vandal operatives to begin random surveillance on petrol stations and arrest those hoarding the product. Iyamu, who spoke through the command’s Public Relations Officer, Tolu Afolabi, added that the operation would begin by 8am today. “We realised that long queues and artificial scarcity had been created by some petrol dealers and we are ready to address the issue. “We learnt from good authorities that very high number of our petrol stations are now hoarding the product. Some are also selling above N145 pet litre. These are the issues we will tackle squarely,” he stated. The NSCDC boss appealed to motorists to always inform it of any wrongdoings from any filling stations to help his men and officers in carrying out the operation. He promised that the command would also strengthen its operation to prevent those who could divert products meant for Ekiti to another state, thereby creating scarcity in the system. Iyamu, however, warned petrol dealers against inflicting hardship on the people by hoarding the product, saying it is illegal and any filling station found culpable of such an activity would be sanctioned accordingly.
