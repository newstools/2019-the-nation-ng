Nasirl-Lahil-Fathi of Nigeria (NASFAT) has said it needs N2.5 billion to complete its Islamic Centre in the country. The centre, located in Asese area on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, will have a mosque with capacity for 3,500 worshippers, a conference/seminar hall and 320 ablution points. NAFSAT’s President worldwide Kamil Bolarinwa, who broke the news, said other facilities the centre will have include a hotel and suites, children’s playground and others essentials for a decent Islamic environment. Bolarinwa spoke at the weekend in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, at a fundraising ceremony. Represented by the society’s Vice-President I, Prince Ago Fagbemi, the NASFAT President said: “If we are able to accomplish this, it will be a masterpiece, not only in Nigeria but across the West African coast.” The Islamic leader averred that the project had gulped N257 million, adding: “The next stage is the first floor’s block wall, roof slab and dome estimated at N100 million.” He said it had been resolved at the executive council meeting that the “exercise is mandatory for zones, branches and prayer points across the world”. Bolarinwa added: “To this effect, necessary disciplinary measures will be taken against erring zones, branches or prayer points. It is compulsory for all as there is no exception. We must remain key players in Allah’s project. “The foundation-laying ceremony of this Islamic centre was held in May 2017 by Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun. “I hereby urge philanthropists, public-spirited persons and committed Muslims to support this project, which will not only be the pride of NASFAT alone but that of Islam in general.”
