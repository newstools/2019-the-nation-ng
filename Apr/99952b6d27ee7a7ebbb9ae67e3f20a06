The Lagos State Special Task Force on Environmental Sanitation said yesterday that it had seized 109 motorcycles at Second Rainbow, along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, for flaunting traffic laws. It disclosed that it would destroy over 2,500 motorcycles impounded since January for plying restricted routes. These were contained in a statement yesterday by the agency’s Head of Public Affairs, Taofiq Adebayo. According to him, task force Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), at the weekend led operatives to Second Rainbow in Amuwo Odofin Local Government, following residents’ complaints about the illegal activities of commercial motorcyclists. Adebayo said the raid followed warnings to motorcyclists to desist from operating on restricted routes, particularly highways and bridges. Quoting the chairman, he said crimes among some of the motorcyclists were alarming, adding that some harassed passersby at bus stops. “While some harass the public at bus-stops, others dispossess their passengers of belongings such as phones, jewellery and bags. Motorists held up in traffic in the morning and at night around these areas are not spared,” Adebayo said. Noting that “clampdown on illegal activities of these operators will be sustained,” he said the task force would collaborate with the divisional police officers (DPOs) and area commanders to sustain the onslaught. “The chairman warned dispatched riders using power bikes (200cc above) to desist from engaging in illegal commercial activities, as anyone caught violating the traffic laws will be prosecuted. “He urged motorcycle rider associations to, on a regular basis; educate their members on the 475 restricted routes and the life threatening danger surrounding plying highways and bridges. “The chairman, however, confirmed that over 2,500 illegal commercial motorcycles impounded by the agency in the last three months (January to March) will be crushed by the government,” Adebayo said.
