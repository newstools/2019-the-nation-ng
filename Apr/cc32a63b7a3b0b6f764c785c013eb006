A 42-year-old newspaper vendor, identified as Amaechi, was yesterday found dead. He hanged himself in his room. Although not much could be ascertained about the deceased’s personality, The Nation gathered that Amaechi,  described as a rather withdrawn person, as he hardly interacted with his neighbours, was last seen on Monday. One of his co-tenants said he was an indigene of Kwale in Delta State, He said: “We saw him last on Monday when he was leaving the house. Nobody knew when he returned. We never knew he had hanged himself in his room. It was this morning, when we smelled a pungent odour, that we suspected foul play.” Another source, who pleaded anonymity, said Amaechi hardly interacted with people. Police spokesman Chris Orisewezie said he was informed of the incident, but the information was sketchy. He said investigation into the incident would be made later.
