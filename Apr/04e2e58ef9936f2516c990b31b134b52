The Executive Director in charge of Engineering and Technical Services at the Niger Delta Power Holding Company of Nigeria (NDPHCN), Mr.  Ifeoluwa Oyedele, an engineer, has won the 2019 Ondo Golden Man of the Year award (ODSGMAYA). According to the organisers:  “The ODSGMAYA  is a modest, unique and unadulterated platform established in Ondo State with its variants in other Nigerian states by the African Stride International Limited. “It is aimed at rewarding excellence, good leadership, selfless service, pioneering efforts, innovation and philanthropy among public-spirited leaders, leading public servants, community leaders, successful entrepreneurs and private individuals, political heads of government and administrators, professionals and captains of industry with zest and passion for positive impacts and community cum national development, who are indigenes of Ondo State.” The choice of Oyedele, according to Henry Adesola, the Project Director, was borne out of “his versatility, incredible impacts and invaluable contributions to the development of his immediate community, Ondo State and Nigeria at large, just as his present assignment has brought about tremendous improvement in the power sector, much the same way his outlandish displays in the political skyline of Ondo State and Nigeria have continued to reverberate with incandescent attractions.” The award, which was last received by Chief Olusola Oke, SAN, will be bestowed on Oyedele in June in Akure, the Ondo State capital.
