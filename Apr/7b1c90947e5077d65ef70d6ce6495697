A 32-year-old unemployed man, Sunday Ebiefegha, was yesterday brought before an Igbosere Magistratesâ€™ Court, Lagos, for allegedly shoplifting items worth about N2.6 million from a supermarket. The defendant, whose residential address was not given, is standing trial on a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh said the defendant and others at large committed the offences between May 30, 2018 and April 21, at Adiba Supermarket, 54, Adeola Odeku Street, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Mameh said the brands of wine were valued at N2.5 million. The prosecutor alleged that the defendant returned to the same supermarket the second time on April 21 and stole items worth N66, 300. He said the items stolen the second time were Moet necter rose, Moet eye imperial, Ions moifet wine, a bottle of Hero beer, a pack of towel and tissue paper. According to him, the total value of the items allegedly stolen was about N2.6 million. Mameh said the offences contravened sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
