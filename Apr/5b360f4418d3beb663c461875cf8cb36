Edo State Acting Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, has assured that the state government will not compromise on quality in road constructions across the state, as part of renewed drive to open more parts of the state to economic activities. Shaibu gave the assurance when he inspected road construction work in Kings Garden Road, Jattu, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State. Addressing journalists after inspecting the road construction, the acting governor said the work is being carried out through the Ministry of Infrastructure and the State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR) Plus, a new scheme wholly funded by the state government using the World Bank template to intensify road construction across the state. He said, â€œThe Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration will ensure standard and quality work is done on the road to meet international standards. Shaibu added that the state government through the Ministry of Infrastructure has mandated the construction of standard drainage system for every road construction project. The acting governor also inspected remediation work at the Ewu Gully Erosion site in Esan Central Local Government Area of the state.
