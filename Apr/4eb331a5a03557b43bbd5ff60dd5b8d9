Brent price, yesterday, moved towards $70 per barrel, as expectations of tight global supply outweighed pressure from rising United States (U.S.) inventories and production. Brent futures rose 16 cents to $69.47 per barrel, the highest since Nov. 12, when it last traded above $70. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slipped 13 cents to $62.33 a barrel. The contract hit $62.99 on Thursday, also the highest since November. Brent has gained nearly 30 per cent this year, while WTI has risen nearly 40 per cent. Prices have been underpinned by U.S. sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan crude, along with OPEC production cuts and rising global demand. According to Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney: “There is a clear bias to the upside with the supply restrictions. And there’s a much better than expected demand picture after the recent China and U.S. PMI numbers, along with a potential kicker from any U.S.-China trade agreement.
