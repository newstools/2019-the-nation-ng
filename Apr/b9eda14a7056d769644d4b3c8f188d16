Neymar has revealed that Chelsea forward Eden Hazard is the player he would like to work alongside – saying the two could ‘wreak havoc’ together. Both players have been linked with huge transfers to Real Madrid this season – as Los Blancos prepare to embark on a summer squad overhaul following a disappointing campaign. Zinedine Zidane has returned to the managerial hot-seat and is poised to run the rule over the Madrid squad, with both Neymar and Hazard reportedly on his shopping list. And the 27-year-old Brazil star has revealed he is open to playing alongside the Belgian playmaker. ‘I would like to play with Hazard. He has a style similar to mine,’ Neymar told Fox Sports, as quoted by Goal. “I think I could give it a try. We would cause havoc together.” Neymar finally returned to action for PSG against Monaco last weekend following a recurrence of a metatarsal injury. The injury, suffered against Strasbourg in January, ruled him out of his side’s ill-fated Champions League last-16 tie with Manchester United, but they have gone on to retain the Ligue 1 title and reach the French Cup final in his absence. The Brazilian has appeared in only 50 of 105 possible matches since signing from Barcelona for a record £198million, a move that hasn’t yet proven it’s worth. Neymar left behind a potent strike partnership with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, and he admitted it was not easy to leave Catalonia. “Barcelona is a club that has always fascinated me, and I still love it today. But at that time I wanted to try something new and that’s why I decided to leave,” the 27-year-old added.
