Steel rebars and allied products manufacturer African Foundries Limited said three of its factory workers accidentally touched by a splash of liquid metal from a furnace in its factory actually used an unauthorized location described as restricted area within the company premises. The three workers affected by the industrial accident, which occurred at the company’s factory on April 11, 2019, at about 7:00am, were rushed to a nearby hospital in Ikorodu, Lagos, where they later passed on. But, a statement by the company’s Executive Director, Uche Iwuamadi, explained that the victims had already closed from work, “but were taking their bath in an open place in an unauthorized location described as restricted area within the factory instead of the normal factory bathroom.” The statement, which was made available to The Nation over the weekend, said as a result of the accident, local staff in conjunction with outside hoodlums, rioted and caused damages. “They also looted the company’s property and cash,” the statement added Iwuamadi said that the local staff and the hoodlums also attacked the company’s foreign nationals, causing injuries to some of them, while also dispossessing them of their personal effects and cash in their residential quarters within the plant. The statement said the estimated loss to the company as a result of the crisis was yet to be determined. It, however, said with the intervention of the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Army, the situation was brought under control. The Company also said it has reached out to the families of the deceased for condolences and necessary settlement discussions, adding that at moment, everywhere is calm.
