Goals from Aaron Ramsey and Alexandre Lacazette gave Arsenal a 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday. The win lifted the north London side to third place in the Premier League above rivals Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. Ramsey found his way through a packed defence on the half-hour following a sweeping move. The Welsh midfielder found Lacazette and raced forward into the area to meet the return pass with a sweetly timed left-foot shot that went in off the far post. Lacazette put the game to bed in the 83rd minute when Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles failed to clear a header into the area from Arsenal substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Frenchman nipped in behind Lascelles and chipped an inch-perfect ball over keeper Martin Dubravka to seal the win. The result put Arsenal on 63 points, two ahead of Spurs and Manchester United, with London rivals Chelsea a further point behind. The win ensured that Arsenal keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish and qualification for Champions League football next season. Newcastle remain in 14th place on 35 points. (Reuters/NAN)
