Less than 24 hours after showing Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri exit in the men’s singles of the 2019 ITTF World Championships, world number one – China’s Fan Zhendong met his waterloo on Thursday April 25 after he was also bundled out of the competition. Also, fans’ favourite, Timo Boll of Germany has withdrawn from his round of 16 tie against Korea’s Woojin Jang after it was confirmed that the former world number one has fever. In a statement issued and made available to NationSport, the German legend, unfortunately, fell ill with a fever and had to pull out of the Men’s Singles Event. He will, however, try his best to recover in time for his Men’s Doubles match with Patrick FRANZISKA. Seeded number one and ranked number one in the world, Fan Zhendong has been tipped as one of the favourites to claim the title having dominated the ranking for more than a year but he met a stiff opposition in his compatriot – Jingkun Lian. From the start of the encounter on centre table, it was as if Fan Zhendong was destined to rule the tournament with his powerful shots in the first game. He however struggled to win the first game at 11-5. But Liang restored parity and raced to the lead with 11-4, 11-8, 11-9 wins. But Fan Zhendong was not ready to depart the competition without a fight, the Chinese super star who made nonsense of African champion in the round of 32, fought back in the fifth game which he won at 11-8. The sixth game was explosive with both players entertaining the specataors with their intermitent rally and storkes but at the end it Liang that carried the day with 11-7 win to complete a 4-2 vicotry over Fan Zhendong. A disappotined Fan Zhendong told NationSport after the match that he was disappointed with his performance in the encounter. “I really prepared well for this competition and I am so disappointed with my performance in the round of 16. It was a big loss to me but I hope to direct my energy to the mixed doubles match later in the day,” Fan Zhendong said.
