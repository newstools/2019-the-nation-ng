The National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Chief Victor Oye, has absorbed himself from allegations leveled against him by aggrieved members of the party. He wondered why some party members would continue to castigate and impugn his integrity after working so hard for the party. The party had been rocked with crises over the conduct and outcome of last primary of the general elections which some members kicked against. Speaking with journalists at the weekend in Amawbia, Awka South local government area of Anambra State, the APGA helmsman urged the aggrieved members to sheathe their swords in the interest of the party. He warned that the party would no longer fold its hands and allow any person to destroy efforts put in place to give APGA an identity in the country. He said, “I have not deliberately offended anybody in the course of my duty as the national chairman of this great party. During our primaries in 2019, I didn’t send anybody out to do untoward things for me. I sent them to go and do good jobs for our party and bring me result. If anybody went there to do any dirty thing, it was his integrity that he destroyed not mine nor of the party. Oye continued, “The primaries had come and gone. Everybody won’t win the primaries; some will win. I can’t understand where these grievances are coming from. However, I’m not perturbed. It’s only God that can decide our faith in life. Only God can crown a king; and when God anoints you, no man can undo the anointing.
