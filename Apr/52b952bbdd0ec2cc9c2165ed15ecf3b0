A teenager, Mukaila Shaibu, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for allegedly attempting to dispossess some people of their belongings. Shaibu, whose address was not provided, is standing trial for conspiracy and attempt to steal. He, however, denied committing the offences. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada said Shaibu committed the offences with two persons at large on March 19, at Otedola Bridge on Lagos/Ibadan Expressway, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant was caught while trying to dispossess people, whose vehicles broke down, of their belongings. “Shaibu threatened the people; saying if they misbehaved, he would gun them down,” the prosecutor said. He said the defendant was apprehended and handed over to the police. Chief Magistrate Mrs. M.I. Dan-Oni granted Shaibu N100, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on April 24.
