Residents of Gelegele community in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo have decried the presence of soldiers from the 19 Battalion Koko and 4 Brigade, Benin in their community. Spokesman of the community, Chief Macaulay Ayiwei, who spoke to newsmen in Benin City, said the soldiers were strategically positioned around the Ijaw community. Chief Ayiwei noted that the high presence of the military may not be unconnected with the land dispute between Benin community of Ughoton and Gelegele. Ayiwei said: “Yes, the court is billed to sit on this matter on Monday and Tuesday but what are they (Army) doing here taking over the whole community? “If there is no sinister motive about this, why will a whole detachment of military from Delta and Edo States, armed with gunboats, take over a whole community as early as 6am on Friday? “While we have them around the community, about five truck load of them are stationed at Ekenwan baracks as we speak. “The whole Gelegele community is in utter confusion as to what is happening. We are also not unaware that their presence has something to do with the dispute between the Ijaw community and the Benin. “While we appeal to our people to remain calm, we are also calling on the President to call the army, especially the 4 Brigade Commandant, who is a Benin man, to order and not to plunge the state into crisis.” But the Army urged the people to go about their normal business Spokesman of the 4 Brigade of the Nigeria Army, Captain Mohammed Maidawa, described the presence of the army as a normal routine exercise.
