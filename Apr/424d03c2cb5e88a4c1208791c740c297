FBNQuest Merchant Bank has announced N40.96 billion annual revenue for the 2018 financial year. The result was released at the company’s fourth Annual General Meeting held yesterday in Lagos. In a statement, it said that despite strong growth in other income which was driven by net gains from fees, commission and sundry income, the bank reported a shortfall compared to the previous year’s performance. It noted that the operating environment in 2018 was particularly challenging for the business. The year was characterised by contracting spreads in the fixed income market, a sluggish equity/M&A market, fewer transactions, and a competitive landscape that has become more intense. The company’s profit before tax grew by 56.2 per cent year-on-year to N16.4 billion from N10.5 billion in Dec 2017. The main contributors were the Asset Management, Corporate Banking and Fixed Income, Currencies and Trading (FICT) businesses. This again demonstrates the resilient and diversified nature of the business portfolio. Assets under management (AuM) across the group (FBNQuest Asset Management) increased by five per cent to close at N261 billion .
