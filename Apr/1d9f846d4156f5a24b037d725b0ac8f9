Chief of Air Staff, (CAS) Air Marshal Saddique Baba Abubakar has given marching order to personnel of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) to eliminate bandits and insurgents terrorizing their areas of responsibility. He told his men to think out of the box and immediately evolve strategies, including insertion of panthers into the hostile zones to conduct surgical operations to eliminate the bandits. The CAS gave the order in his remarks during the commissioning of accommodation projects at the Regiment Training Center (RTC) and Military Training Center, (MTC)  NAF base in Kaduna on Wednesday. Represented by the Chief of Policy and Plans, NAF Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal, Emmanuel Anebi, the CAS tasked the Air Officer Commanding, Ground Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Idi Amin, and his regiment officers to ‘think out of the box’ and immediately evolve strategies, part of which includes inserting panthers into hostile zones to conduct surgical operations to eliminate bandits and high value targets terrorizing the country. According to him: “While capacity is been built within the NAF, we must continue to develop strategies to anticipate and curb emerging security threats accross the country.” CAS however said the efforts of the Federal Government to adequately equip the military are already yielding the desired results as the Boko-Haram terrorists are being targeted and neutralised. Air Officer Commanding AOC Idi Amin said there has been a giant stride by the leadership of the NAF in the area of training, kitting and welfare of officers and men of the force and “the result is evident in the successes recorded by its personnel in fight against insurgency and other internal operations across the country by its well -motivated personnel.” The projects commissioned by the CAS include three blocks of 10 by one bedroom in cadets quarters and MTC, two blocks of 20 by one students hostel at RTC.
