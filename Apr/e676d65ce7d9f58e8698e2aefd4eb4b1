Accenture Plc beat estimates for quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast as it continues to benefit from investments in digital and cloud services, sending its shares four percent higher. Much of Accenture’s recent growth has been driven by digital and cloud services, which include everything from managing clients’ social media marketing strategies to helping them migrate to the cloud. The services made up more than 60 percent of its total revenue in the second quarter. Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said Accenture’s beat and raise reflect a very bullish spending environment for the IT services sector. “This is driven by large digital transformation programs at enterprises as well as by a ‘catch-up’ in spending on legacy, rationalisation projects”. Accenture competes with Cognizant as well as with major Indian IT companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. Accenture, which has spent billions of dollars over the recent years on acquisitions to strengthen its business, said on Thursday it still expects to spend up to $1.5 billion on deals during fiscal 2019. It has already made at least three small acquisitions this year. The company’s operating costs rose 5.3 percent in the second quarter, but gross margins climbed to 29.2 percent from 28.9 percent. The consulting and outsourcing services provider hiked its full-year earnings per share forecast range to $7.18 to $7.32, from $7.01 to $7.25. The company’s revenue rose 5.5 percent to $10.45 billion, ahead of estimates of $10.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the quarter ended February 28, net income attributable to the company rose 30 percent. On a per share basis, Accenture earned $1.73 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.57 per share.
