EIGHT hundred and twenty high and medium buses will be rolled out under the  Lagos State Government’s Bus Reform Initiative (BRI), Transportation Commissioner Ladi Lawanson said yesterday. He said 800 of the buses would be released to private operators under a lease model, which has incorporated the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN). Lawanson, who spoke with reporters in his Alausa, Ikeja office, said the BRI would boost government’s determination to organise the public transportation system. He said: “The bus reform project was designed to find solution to the perennial challenges of poor quality service, unpredictable fare, unhealthy competition, high rate of accidents and unreliable service.” Under the BRI regime, he said the yellow mini-buses would be replaced with air conditioned ones of uniform specification, with predictable schedules and routes, supported with infrastructure. The implementation of the initiative, the commissioner said, began with the construction and inauguration of the Ikeja Bus Terminal by President Muhammadu Buhari last year. He said the other terminals were at Yaba, Oyingbo, Ojota, Agege and Ajah.  The masterpiece, the Oshodi Transport Interchange, Lawanson said, would be completed and unveiled by President  Buhari before May 29. The commissioner said the project, which would be technology-driven, would ensure seamless integration of transport modes and passenger movement through 23 routes. He said 75 of the planned 100 bus shelters had been completed under the first phase of the project to support the buses’ operation.
