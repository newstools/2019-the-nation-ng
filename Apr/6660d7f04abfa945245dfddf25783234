IN a competition among multiple Media Agencies in Nigeria at the Young Lions Media competition held recently, Rita Oladimeji and Tobi Babalola from mediaReach OMD grabbed the title of Young Lions Media – Nigeria. With this win, mediaReach OMD will represent Nigeria at Cannes in June 2019 for the Cannes Young Lions Media – Global Competition. By winning the 2019 edition of the competition, mediaReach OMD will be representing Nigeria for the 9th time at Cannes, since 2008. Babalola and Oladimeji have also won the Young Pitcher Integrated competition and have qualified for Dubai Lynx, which will happen in March 2020. The above two competitions were open to young (under 30 years) media professionals representing various Media Agencies in Nigeria. Teams representing various media agencies this year were given a Media Brief as part of Young Lions Media competition and had little over 24 hours to think, create and submit a communication strategy that answers the Media Brief. Finally, based on the presentations to the Jury, comprising of senior Media Advertising professionals, the winning campaign and team was chosen based on criteria used for the Cannes Young Lions Media – Global competition. The Young Lions Media Global competition to be held at Cannes in June 2019, gives the next generation of industry superstars the chance to prove themselves by creating campaigns during the Festival week, where more than 400 contestants representing various countries around the globe compete in seven categories (namely Media, Digital, Design, Print, Film, Marketers and PR). The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is the World’s biggest celebration of creativity in marketing communications. It is also the greatest opportunity of the year for industry professionals to network and learn about brand communications.
