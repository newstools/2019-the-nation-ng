There is a crack in the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress over endorsement of Governor Godwin Obaseki for second term by leaders of the party in Oredo local government area. The Oredo APC leaders had endorsed Governor Obaseki as the party’s sole candidate for next year’s governorship election. General Charles Airhiavbere, a former governorship aspirant of both the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, has indicated interest to contest for the APC gubernatorial ticket. Some APC leaders who spoke to our reporter on condition of anonymity said the action of the Oredo leaders was received with shock. They said it was wrong for the Oredo leaders to shut out other aspirants. An APC chieftain in Edo North said it was laughable that the leaders that orchestrated the endorsement could not win their units and wards during the presidential election. The leader said some Oredo APC orchestrated the endorsement because they could not account for N40m of the money released to mobilise for the Presidential and National Assembly election. According to him, “How could they be talking about endorsement when they did not win election? The Oredo leaders did not consult even with Ward and Unit leaders of the party. “What they did is undemocratic and capable of giving victory to the PDP.  It is a surprise that people that could not deliver their units are running to endorse a candidate when election is not near.” Another APC chieftain from Ikpoba-Okha local government said the individuals that diverted election money would be made to account for it whether they endorse Obaseki or not. State Secretary of the party, Mr. Lawrence Okah, who hails from Oredo said the endorsement was done by confirmed leaders of the party. Okah said those complaining were disgruntled members of the party. He denied allegations that the endorsement was to pacify Obaseki over diversion of N40m.
