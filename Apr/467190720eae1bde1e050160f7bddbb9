 World cup bound Eaglets Saturday played out a 1-1 draw with their Ugandan counterparts in the last group match of the ongoing Under 17 Nations cup in Tanzania. The Ugandan who desperately needed a win to hazard a chance of progressing shot into the lead in the 68th minute of the match through substitute John Alou. The Eaglets however came from behind to level up in the 74th minute thanks to Ibraheem Jabaar who got a timely assist from Olakunle Olusegun. The Ugandans who afterwards mounted a lot of pressure with intent to increase the tally failed to achieve the dream as the Eaglets stood their ground but wasted some begging chances that would have handed them outright victory to ensure three wins in three matches. The team nonetheless finished the group stage on high, topping the group with seven points above Angola who finished in the second position thus showing both hosts and Uganda the exit doors. Eaglets will await the outcome of the ties between Guinea versus Morocco and Cameroon versus Senegal on Sunday.  Cameroon lead group B with 6 points going into Sunday’s match while Guinea occupy the second position with three points going into Sunday’s match. Morocco and Senegal have already crashed with just a point each. Eaglets are likely to face Guinea in the semifinals while Cameroon who will be looking to consolidate their lead Sunday will face Angola in the second semifinals on Wednesday. The finals of the championship take place on April 28 at National Stadium, Dar es Salaam.
