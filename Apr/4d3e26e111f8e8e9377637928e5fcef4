Eventstracer.com, an online business events platform will hold its maiden edition of Small and Medium Sized Event Planners’ Summit. Tagged: ‘Growing my events,’ the summit will hold at Best Western Star Fire Hotel, GRA, Ikeja on Saturday, May 4th, 2019, at 10am. Speaking to journalists during a media briefing, the General Manager Voidant Broadcasting Limited, VBL, a media technology company and owners of eventstracer.com, Maxwell Nzekwe said the summit will provide participants with transformational knowledge about events management and business skills. According to him, among those expected at the event are renowned business owners who have been carefully selected based on their broad experience, achievements and expertise across all aspects of the event management industry. Expatiating, he said the event will close with a post-summit networking, he mentioned the speakers to include Convener, Nigeria International Film Summit, NIFS, Ijeoma Onah, Executive Director, Balmoral Events Limited and a Certified Business Coach, Folashade Odunaiya. Nzekwe said the summit became necessary after a research by eventstracer showed that despite the growth in Nigeria’s event industry, there is still a huge gap in the provision of value to stakeholders in the industry. Explaining that until now, all the stakeholders in the events industry have been operating independently and they play a vital role in the making any event successful, he said the event will make it the first time someone is integrating them into a proper event experience delivery machinery. “The stakeholders include sponsors, event owners, exhibitors, event venue owners and event visitors. The event value chain which consists of event naming, event design, venue choice and event execution still requires plenty of development for the event industry to keep growing and this is one of the reasons eventstracer is organising this summit,” he added.
