The Federal High Court Abuja on Monday, has admitted in evidence, documents tendered by the prosecution, through the 20th prosecution witness,  Mr Chris Odofin, in the N29 billion fraud trial filed against a former governor of Adamawa, Murtala Nyako. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Nyako is being prosecuted alongside his sons, Sen. Abdul-Aziz Nyako, Abubakar Aliyu and Zulkifikk Abba on a 37-count charge of criminal conspiracy, stealing, abuse of office and money laundering. Some of the documents admitted in evidence include a certified true copy of a document captured ‘Blue Opal Nigeria Limited and Blue Opal sales details.’ The charge was preferred against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC). Five companies, Blue Opal Limited, Sebore Farms & Extension Limited, Pagoda Fortunes Limited, Tower Assets Management Limited and Crust Energy Limited, were equally charged before the court as the 5th to 9th defendants. The witness was led in evidence by the prosecuting counsel, Mr Rotimi Jacobs, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). Odofin told the court that in the course of investigating the case, Mohammed Maji-Iro and Abdulmalik Dalhatu were invited by the commission to give statements, but that they both died before the matter was charged to court. He also told the court that Mr. Kobis Ari-Thumnu, former Secretary to the State Government of Adamawa and Mahmud Nyako also made statements to the EFCC, but when the matter was charged to court, all efforts to reach them were futile. The defence counsel in court led by Mr. Ibrahim Isiaku (SAN) prayed the court to adjourn the matter to enable them prepare to cross examine the witness. The trial judge, Justice Okon Abang adjourned the matter until April 10 for the defence to cross-examine Odofin.
