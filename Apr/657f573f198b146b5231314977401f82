Lagos State workers must continue to uphold the value of synergy and teamwork for maximum organisational performance, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has said. Speaking at the opening session of a two-day training programme tagged: Team Building and Synergy Workshop for Peak Performance organised by the Lagos State Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions in Lagos, Ambode who was represented by the Commissioner of the ministry, Dr. Akintola Benson said the decision of the state government to approve training programmes for the workers is a proof that he recognises the importance of team work and synergy in achieving corporate objectives. He said this also represents the government’s commitment to fully assist the civil service to appreciate and acquire the benefits that trainings bring to bear on the attainment of the strategic objectives of the government and the effectiveness of the institutions of the civil service. He said: “The Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions is the government’s agent and trusted partner in this regard, and I believe that the ministry will continue to devote time and resources to the acquisition of all relevant skills by the officers of the state civil service.”
