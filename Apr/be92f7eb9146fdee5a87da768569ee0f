Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress(APC)  yesterday kicked against new appointments and transactions  by Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State, saying these transactions would not be binding on the in-coming government in the state. In a statement by the Publicity Secretary of the Caretaker Committee of APC in the state, Tunde Oladunjoye, it alleged that Governor Ibikunle Amosun- led administration has engaged in last minutes awards of contracts, withdrawals from treasury, sales of land and illegal recruitment of Senator Amosun’s cronies into senior positions of the Ogun State Civil Service, ostensibly to tie the hands of its successor. APC noted that such reported transactions are shocking,  and warned members of the general public that such hurried deals would not necessarily be binding on the incoming administration. The party stated: “It has come to our notice that the outgoing administration of His Excellency, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, is busy with last minute awards of contracts, selling and auctioning of government properties, and secret  recruitments into the civil service,  in a way to tie the hands of the incoming Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun. “While we find these reported last-minutes awards of contracts, withdrawals from treasury, sales of land and illegal recruitment of Senator Amosun’s cronies into senior positions of the Ogun State Civil Service, very shocking, our party wishes to warn the members of the general public that such hurried transactions would not necessarily be binding on the incoming administration. “We urge Ogun State’s top senior civil servants not to be part of the desperate moves of the departing governor to undermine socio-economic stability of our state, by engaging in, condoning or being part of any act that breaches or constitute a flagrant abuse of laid-down rules, regulations and due process. “It is our belief that an administration with less than two months to handover, should, by now, be preparing its handover notes for a smooth transition, instead of digging pits for the incoming government. “May we also reiterate here that all loans, overdraft and financial obligations that do not follow due process, including the approval of the Ogun State House of Assembly, would not be honoured…”
