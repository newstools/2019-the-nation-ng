After a keenly -contested match on Sunday evening, the mechanical engineering department emerged winners of the 2019 Covenant Chancellor’s cup. The team defeated Building Technology department 4: 2 on penalties. Both teams had their chances in the fierce battle for one champion, which was the theme of the competition. But the water-logged pitch impacted heavily on the match’s outcome, which was eventually settled in a thrilling penalty shootout. Alkamah, the Mech engineering goal keeper, lived up to his heroic status, saving two penalties taken by the Building Tech skipper Gyuse and Joshua. Then Layomi tucked in the winning penalty to hand Mechanical Engineering their first Chancellor’s cup. The winning team’s players were later hosted to a dinner by the maverick talent management and sport marketing firm, Bspot.
