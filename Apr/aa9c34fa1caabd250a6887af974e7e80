IMAGINE yourself walk  into a  bank, withdraw $10 million cash from your account, put it in your car, head home and spread the whole lot on the bed. Well, Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, once did that just to look at the cash and convince himself that he is truly rich. Dangote himself confirmed his action at the Mo Ibrahim governance weekend in Abidjan. “The way it is  is that when you first start business, your target is to make your first million. Fine, I did that,” online publication The Cable quoted him as saying. . “After a year or so, I realised that I had much more, and I said ok, fine, all these numbers are just written numbers. “One day I went to a bank, and at that time, there were no restrictions, and I wrote a cheque and cashed $10m from the bank and put it in the boot of my vehicle, and I went home and I opened it and I looked at $10m and I said ‘now I believe I have money’.” Mission accomplished, Dangote returned the cash to the bank the following day. Dangote is reckoned as the 74th richest man in the world with assets worth $16.4 billion.
