Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Task force) Unit, in collaboration with the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), yesterday dislodged over 1,500 street traders. It arrested 15 of them for prosecution during an enforcement operation at Oyingbo. The operation, led by the task force Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, is in continuation of the clampdown on street trading across the state by the task force. Egbeyemi, according to a statement from the agency, said the traders persisted in their illegal activities despite warnings by selling goods on the roads, medians, road setbacks, drainage alignments and railway tracks near Oyingbo market. He said the traders’ actions impeded free flow of traffic along the axis, adding that the government would not tolerate such illegal activities that violated environmental laws. “Section (1) of the Lagos State Street Trading and Illegal Market Prohibition Law of 2003 prohibits buyers and sellers from engaging in business activities at an unauthorised place, while the penalty for engaging in illegal street trading is a fine of N90,000 or six-month jail term for anyone found guilty of contravening the law”, Egbeyemi said. “The enforcement operation was also meant to protect lives of the illegal traders from unforeseen circumstances such as accident by reckless private/commercial drivers and also to decongest traffic along that axis”, he added. Warning those engaging in street trading to desist from endangering their lives and operate inside the ‘Oyingbo Ultra-Modern Market’ built by the government, Egbeyemi said the arrested traders would be prosecuted.
