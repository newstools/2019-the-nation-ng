As a show of commitment to making sure that no student drops out of school on account of financial constraint, the Management of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, has awarded scholarships to the tune of N1,150,000 to 23 physically-challenged students. The scholarship scheme was part of support to students by the Students’ Support Centre of the university – with each of the 23 beneficiaries getting N50, 000. Presenting cheques to the beneficiaries, the Vice Chancellor, Prof Igbekele Ajibefun, who was represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), Prof Francis Gbore, reassured the students of the university’s love for them and reiterated that the university would not relent in supporting them. Responding on behalf of the beneficiaries, Boboye Adeusi, 400-level student of the Department of Mass Communication, appreciated the kind gesture of the University Management and appealed for continuation of the scheme, which he described as a model and an ideal initiative that should be emulated by other institutions. Earlier, the Coordinator of the Student Support Centre, Dr. Adediran Ikuomola, had said the Institution values all students as demonstrated in giving the scholarship. He said the Centre will continue to work on the challenges faced by students and explore more creative ways of making the centre more functional.
