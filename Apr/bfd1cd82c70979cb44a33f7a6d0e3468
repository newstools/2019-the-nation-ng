The Federal Government has shifted the Abuja carnival  scheduled to take place in December 2018 to November 2019. Permanent Secretary Ministry of Information Deaconess Grace Gekpe said the carnival among other gains will provide a platform  to recreate and continue the onerous task of nation building after the peaceful general elections. She added that the carnival is conceived to showcase the country’s strength even in our diversity and to forge a nation of one destiny, one people. Gekpe stated these on Monday in Abuja at the 2019 Abuja carnival stakeholders meeting. She said: “It is worthy of note that carnivals aside from being a vehicle for wealth creation, poverty reduction, employment generation, and social integration is also a panacea for a peaceful and stable society. Though diverse in language, tribe, culture and tradition as well as in religious and political philosophy, the carnival is conceived to showcase our strength even in our diversity and to forge a nation of one destiny, one people. “This year’s carnival, among other gains, wili provide the platform to unwind, recreate and continue the onerous task of nation-building after the peaceful 2019 generai eiections. “The Ministry is not unmindful of the justifiable concerns of the stakeholders within and outside of the sector over the postponements of the Carnival from December, 2018 to November, 2019. “While we regret the inconvenience caused by these shifts in dates, it is however pertinent that the input from the technical forum would enhance our capacity to organise a world-class event. This way, we will not only sustain the Abuja Carnival but surpass the standard of previous editions.”
