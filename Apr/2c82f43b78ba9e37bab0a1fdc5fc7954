The Albert Einstein Hospital said on its website that Peleâ€™s surgery went well, but did not provide additional details. The 78-year-old returned to Brazil on April 2 after spending five days in a Paris hospital for a urinary infection. He had been in France to attend an event with Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe. Pele has been in the hospital frequently over the last few years for kidney and prostate problems.
