SYNLAB, formerly Pathcare Laboratories, has announced the relocation of its Victoria Island branch to 64 Adetokunbo Ademola Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. The company, renowned for high-quality clinical laboratory testing, has begun service at the new address since 1 April. Dr. Tolulope Adewole, executive director (operations), SYNLAB Nigeria, said “Our beautiful new location is more spacious with more than double the previous phlebotomy room capacity, reducing waiting time for our clients. The new location offers better parking facilities, while the modern interior and improved customer care is poised for a better customer experience.” He urged residents and those who work on the Island to “come and visit us at our new home and experience healthcare as it should be, and not what we know it as.” SYNLAB presently offers access to more than 5,000 tests, including some of the most advanced genetic tests. The company prides itself in the reliability and accuracy of its test results. In line with its vision to make healthcare accessible, SYNLAB has also opened a new ultra-modern laboratory in Abuja and a patient care centre in Calabar during the first months of 2019, while construction is already underway on its Abeokuta facility. Over the past 15 years, SYNLAB has brought international expertise, world-class healthcare, new specialised services and enhanced medical diagnostic to Nigerians.  The SYNLAB group, Europe’s number one medical diagnostics provider, operates in more than 40 countries across four continents.
