The National Judicial Council said it has extended the appointment of the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad for another three months. The NJC, in a statement earlier today, said it took the decision at its 88th Meeting held last Thursday. NJC’s spokesman, Soji Oye said, in the statement, that the extension was at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari, who made a request to that effect. The statement reads: “The attention of the National Judicial Council has been drawn to an online newspaper and daily newspaper report stating that the Council would meet next week to deliberate on the extension of the Acting Appointment of Honourable Dr. Justice I. T. Muhammad CFR, as the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria. “Contrary to the above, the Council actually met on Thursday 18th April, 2019 and at the 88th Meeting considered and approved the request of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for the extension of the appointment of Hon. Dr. Justice I. T. Muhammad, CFR, as the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria for another three (3) months and council has since forwarded its approval to the President.”
