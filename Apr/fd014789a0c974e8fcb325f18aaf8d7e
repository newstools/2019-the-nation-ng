Arcadia Premium TV, a new cable and online television company, has said it is poised to revolutionise television experience in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. The new television company, which would launch its products in June, this year, will be on Startimes Channel 176 and also online. In anticipation of the official launch of the television station, its founders, Olamide Yousuph and Akintunde Marinho hosted some journalists to a round-table recently. According to the founders,  the television station would focus on telling the African story through the mobile TV platform. They said Arcadia was propelled to create premium entertainment on cable TV for a wider and diverse audience producing content ranging from music, sports, movies, comedy, fashion and lifestyle, amongst other premium content. “We are producing 19 original titles that you have not seen anywhere else before and this is something that is very new,” Akintunde Marinho, Co-Founder Arcadia Premium TV said. “We have international content partners like Sony, Universal, HBO that we are in contact with to help with international content. However, the drive is to develop an inventory of original content from Africa not just Nigeria. We are looking at content from South Africa, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya.” Olamide Yousuph, the Chief Operations Officer of the company, said: “There’s always going to be consistency in the quality of shows we air.”
