Bode Abiodun and Edem Offiong were relentless in their win against their opponents at the ongoing ITTF World Championships in Budapest after recording 4-0 and 4-1 respectively in their group opener. It was Edem Offiong who gave Nigeria more hope in the women’s singles as she walloped Latvia’s KLIMANOVA Natalija with 11-6, 3-11, 11-3, 12-10, 11-4 to improve her chance of advancing to the elite stage of the women’s singles. Like Offiong, Abiodun was no match for New Zealand’s Dainis Reinholds after a convincing 11-6, 11-7, 11-4, 11-4 to put one leg into the main draw. Offiong, Abiodun, Olufunke Oshonaike, Segun Toriola, Olajide Omotayo and Ajoke Ojomu will be playing their last group matches with the sole aim of picking slots in the main draw of the men and women’s singles.
