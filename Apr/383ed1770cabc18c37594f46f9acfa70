Jigawa State Acting Governor Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia has confirmed the arrest of five suspects in connection with the robbery at Gidan Maidawa village in Dutse Local Government. The acting governor, who is also the deputy governor, made the confirmation while responding to the allegation by the lawmaker representing Gume/Gagarawa/Maigatari/ Suletankarkar Federal Constituency, Muhammed Sani Zoro, who accused Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar of abandoning the state, causing alleged increase in crime. The acting governor dismissed the allegation, saying “it is baseless and is political. Jigawa is one of the most peaceful states in the country.”
