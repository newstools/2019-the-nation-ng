In furtherance of his mandate to develop infrastructure in the state to drive development, Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki has awarded the contract for the construction of Textile Mill Road; Iyoba, Iyobanosa and Omozogie streets as well as an underground drainage system in the area valued at N2.8 billion. The contract was awarded during a recent Executive Council (EXCO) meeting held before the governor proceeded on his annual leave. On completion, the project will “solve the perennial flooding problem of the area and enhance human and vehicular movement especially to the two major motor spare parts market at Evbareke and Uwelu communities and security of lives and property as well as bring to life access to the revered Traditional Palace of Iyoba,” a document on the project stated. Edo residents, particularly those in the area, have hailed the award of the contract, appreciating the Governor Godwin Obaseki for the project which will drive development and provide a conducive environment for businesses in the axis to thrive. The governor, during the campaigns for the last elections in the state, visited the communities and assured them that construction would start on Textile Mill Road and the adjoining streets, a promise which is now being fulfilled. The project follows closely behind the award of contracts for the construction of Benin-Abraka Road; St. Saviour, Oba-Obazagbon, PZ-Okabere Roads and Ugbor-Amagba Road, which were hailed by Benin City residents. The Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration has sustained the campaign to deliver infrastructure projects in different parts of the state, aimed at fortifying the infrastructure base to drive industrialisation, one of the administration’s cardinal policy thrusts. The projects are also expected to open up new towns, as well as, regenerate urban centres.
