Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM), OPPO Mobile at the weekend in Lagos, said it decided to come into the country because of the stability in the foreign exchange (forex)  market and the country’s youthful population. It said any brand willing to play in the global space must open shop in the country. The firm launched  its 2019 flagship devices, the OPPO F11 Pro and the OPPO F11 Pro Avengers limited edition in Lagos at the weekend in line with Marvel Studios partnership. Its Marketing Director, Lily Wang, had said though the firm is a little bit late in coming to the country, she is optimistic that the quality of its products will satnd it out in the local market having remained on the number four slot in global smartphone market. She said: “Yes, it is true that we are coming late to Nigeria because the exchange rate, the economic situation, in the past three years have not been so nice. Nigeria is a big market because Nigeria has 200 million population which makes her the most important country, the biggest in West Africa. Also, Nigeria has a rich culture, rich entertainment, music, Nollywood. Nigeria is the centre of attraction for any brand willing to play on the global stage. That made OPPO to come to Nigeria. “But this year, the economy has improved, especially the exchange rate has become stable. Over the years too, we have seen improvement in the economy. So we think now is the right time to come to Nigeria.” Addressing guests on the occasion, its  Marketing Manager, OPPO Mobile Nigeria, Nengi Akinola, said the firm’s drive is to always deliver products with superior quality, high standard and ‘many firsts’.
