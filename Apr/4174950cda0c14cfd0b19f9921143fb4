A 43-year-old carpenter, Adewale Abolarin, was yesterday brought before a Yaba Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding his customer of N230, 000 under the pretext of making furniture for him. Abolarin pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of stealing and obtaining by false pretence. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Oriabure alleged that the defendant committed the offences on February 1, at Okobaba, Ebute-Meta, Lagos. He said the complainant, Mrs. Remi Nobei, had contracted the defendant to make 25 sets of wooden tables and chairs for her to donate to her alma mater. Oriabure said the defendant and the complainant agreed on N230, 000 as the total sum for the furniture. “As soon as the defendant was paid the entire sum and confirmed receipt of the money, he kept giving excuses for not supplying the furniture. “My Lord, he even deceived the complainant by showing her another customers’ furniture that was not made by him, claiming he had started work on the complainant’s furniture,” he alleged. Magistrate Oluwatoyin Ojuromi granted the defendant N100, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said both sureties must be employed with their addresses verified by the court. Ojuromi ordered that the sureties must live within the court’s jurisdiction and show evidence of three years tax payments to the Lagos State Government. The case continues today.
