While many celebrities tag days of the week with different names such as My Woman Crush, My Man Crush, among others, Nollywood actress and philanthropist Kate Henshaw has tagged hers as ‘Thankful Tuesday’, following her visit to one of the school of blind; Bethesda Home in Agege, Lagos. Narrating an encounter with one of the pupils, the actress noted that many do not know the value of what they have. “So many of us don’t know the value of what we have,” she said. “I sat back and reflected on our visit to Bethesda Home for the blind and I concluded that I have been very ungrateful. While there I was privileged to speak to one of the students who confessed to me that he was born blind…he made a statement that brought tears to my eyes, he said he wished he could see who he is talking to him. I couldn’t hold back the tears. “He doesn’t know what his mother, father and siblings look like and wished God could just give him back his sight. I left feeling ungrateful for constantly complaining of the things He hasn’t done for me and not thanking Him enough.” Bethesda home for the blind is a voluntary and non- profit organisation set up to give physically challenged persons who are visually-impaired and helpless.
