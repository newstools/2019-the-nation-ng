The Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Uyo has ordered Ifa Ikot Akpan village of Etoi clan in Uyo Local Government Area to vacate some plots of land being used as ‘keke’ park to Ibiaku Issiet community in Uruan Local Government Area, the rightful owners. The two neighbouring communities had been locked in a dispute over the land called “Idim Uduok”. According to Ibiaku Issiet people, their forefathers had planted a boundary tree called ‘Akono’, which is still at the boundary till date Delivering judgment on the suit filed by Eteidung Edem Aniedi Ebong and four others on behalf of Ifa Ikot Akpan village, Justice Charles Ikpe said the plaintiffs’ suit lacked merit as it failed to prove its case. The suit No. HU/71/2017 was dismissed and N40, 000 was awarded to the defendants, Ibiaku Issiet community, as cost. According to Justice Ikpe, the court considered “the submissions of the claimants’ counsel and that of defendants, the processes filed by the respective counsels, evidence of witnesses, exhibits tendered in the proceeding and the final written addresses filed by both counsels. He stressed that the plaintiffs’ suit lacked merit and was accordingly dismissed with N40,000 only as cost in favour of the defendants. The court also declared that all parcel of land, which currently make up the ‘keke’ motor park in the area, which the claimants earlier leased to Gitto Construction Limited, belonged to Ibiaku Issiet community. Reacting to the judgment, Ibiaku Issiet village head, Chief William Effiong Etim, said the judgment is nothing, but the truth which prevailed against falsehood, adding that right from the time of their forefathers, the boundary between Ibiaku Issiet community and Ifa Ikot Akpan had always been Idim Uduok where the boundary tree is planted.
