OGUN State Deputy Governor-elect, Mrs Noimot Salako-Oyedele has assured the less-privileged of better days ahead. She stated this when she paid a visit to the lepers’ colony in Iberekodo and the Gideon Orphanage and Home for the aged at Asero, Abeokuta. Accompanied by the wife of the governor-elect, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun, Mrs Salako-Oyedele said the visit, which was to celebrate Easter with them, was also a gesture towards showing the  goodwill of Prince Dapo Abiodun to the physically challenged and people with special needs. Mrs Salako-Oyedele said the incoming administration will make adequate provisions for these. She reiterated the plan to make education free from Primary to Junior secondary levels, saying this would be of benefit to the less privileged. She told reporters after they made donations to the management of the home that the incoming government would look into some of the challenges they had raised, such as increasing their N10,000 monthly  stipends, scholarships and bursary for their children and wards who gained admission into higher institutions.
