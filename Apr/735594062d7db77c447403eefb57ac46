21-year-old carpenter, Wasiu Nojeem, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, for allegedly setting ablaze the car of his neighbour whose wife rebuffed his sex request. The police charged Nojeem  with two counts of breach of the peace and arson. Prosecuting counsel Sergeant Michael Unah alleged that the defendant set a Mitsubishi GDI Space Wagon with registration number AGL 366 EC, valued at N500,000, property of Mr. Abubakar Akeem, ablaze. He said the defendant committed the offence on March 15, at 3am, at 20, Power Line Street, So Easy, Ayobo-Ipaja, a Lagos suburb. Unah said the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by unlawfully demanding sex from the complainant’s wife when he was on a night shift. “The defendant knocked on the complainant’s door at night and demanded sex from his (the complainant’s) wife. “The defendant claimed he saw the complainant’s wife in his dream having sexual intercourse with him and he approached her to let them have sex in real life. “The wife declined and the defendant angrily set the complainant’s car on fire,” the prosecutor alleged. The offence, he said, contravened sections 168 and 342 (b) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised) Chief Magistrate A.A. Fashola granted the defendant N100,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties must be employed with evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified by the court. The case was adjourned till May 9.
