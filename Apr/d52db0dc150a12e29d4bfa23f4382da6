Beyonce’s Coachella set the pace for other artists so much so that when it came to the choice of this year’s headliner, organizers had to ensure to pick someone that could at least hold a match to Bey’s shine. According to report, it has been gathered that the Grammy award-winning Grande raked in N2.8 billion for her two headline slots at Coachella festival. While she is totally deserving of the fee, what has got folks talking is the fact that the amount is reportedly, twice the amount Beyonce got for her gig. It was reported that Beyonce was paid approximately N1.4 billion ($4 million) for her 2018, two-hour “Homecoming” show that sparked a Netflix documentary and a live album of the same name where she performed dozens of her hit songs.
