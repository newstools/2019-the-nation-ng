A 27-year-old plumber, Azeez Muhammed, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistrate’s Court for allegedly breaking into a school to steal laptops and a speaker. He pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of damage and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti said the defendant committed the offence on April 19 at Mushin, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant scaled the fence to gain entrance into Euba Secondary School. Koti added that Muhammed damaged the principal’s office to steal the items, the value of which was yet unknown. “The defendant unlawfully damaged the principal office’s door to steal. “The value of the stolen items is yet to be ascertained,” he said. The prosecutor said the tricycle the defendant parked in front of the school to cart away the items was traced, and he was arrested. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola granted the defendant N 80,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 13.
