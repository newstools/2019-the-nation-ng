Management of the Akwa Ibom State University has promised to reward whistle blowers with N100,000. Speaking during the 2018/2019 matriculation, the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Eno Ibanga, said the measure was adopted to checkmate corruption and its perpetrators. He promised that management would compensate the whistle blower, provided that the information given was valid, adding that such individual’s identity would be protected. Ibanga said: “We have launched the whistle-blowing policy aimed at increasing exposure of staff and students who go against the rules and regulations of the university. “The whistleblower will be rewarded N100,000, if the evidence provided is true, his or her identity will be kept secret and security will be attached to such person if necessary.” The ceremony, which held at the university’s main campus, was attended by new students who took the oath of matriculation. Others present were parents and well-wishers, as well as the varsity’s top principal officers.
