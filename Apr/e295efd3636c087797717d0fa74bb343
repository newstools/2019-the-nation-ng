PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has restated his call for urgent steps to tackle Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs). The latest call was through the Director-General of Nigeria’s Directorate of Technical Aid Corps, Pius Osunyinkami, at the second United Nations (UN) High Level Conference on South-South Cooperation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Osunyikanmi, who led the Nigerian delegation to the conference presented a stunning charge from the President. According to Mr. Osunyinkami, IFFs distort the growth and development of countries, drain foreign reserves, undermine genuine investment and eliminate resources that would have been used for poverty alleviation. The director-general said: “Ending the scourge of IFFs was one of the most cost- effective strategies for facilitating the timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda and other development priorities of the affected countries. “I, therefore, call on all member states and corporate entities participating in this conference to commit to scaling up international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows and strengthen good practices on assets return.” Drumming support for the South-South and other similar cooperations, Osunyinkami stated that Nigeria had been providing volunteer assistance to various countries in need of relevant expertise, a gesture which has challenged the view that Africa was only at the receiving end. According to him, “this scheme and other such schemes in Africa, have challenged the commonly held perception that Africa is only a recipient of aid. It is gratifying that Nigeria’s volunteer service has over the years made positive contributions to the socio-economic development of many African, Caribbean and The Pacific Countries”.
