The cleric said that there was need for Christians to make sacrifices for people who were in need just as Christ died for the salvation of mankind. “We are expected to do what Jesus did for us by accepting to die on the cross for our sins. We must be ready to make sacrifices so that other people will live. We must support people who are in need,” he said. He explained that the salvation of the world was made possible during Easter as it was the time Jesus died on the Cross to save humanity. Audu stated that the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter marked the turning point in the lives of Christians, adding that His resurrection was the determining factor of Christianity. He urged Christians to emulate the life of Jesus whose death and resurrection brought freedom to mankind. “Jesus died and rose from the dead and that is why his resurrection has become a determining factor on why we are his followers. “His rising from the dead has guaranteed us that He can help us to overcome death,” he said.
