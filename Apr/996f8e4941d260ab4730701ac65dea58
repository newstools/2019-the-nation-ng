The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has fixed Councillorship by-election into Ward A (Obele/Oniwala) in Surulere Local Government Area of the State for April 27. Its Chairman, Justice Ayotunde Phillips (retd), said this at a forum organised by the commission for the stakeholders in the ward. Represented by Mrs Toyin Ibrahim-Famakinwa, an Electoral Commissioner, Justice Phillips said the by-election was meant to fill the councillorship seat which became vacant following the death of the occupant, Razak Bello. The Chairman promised that the commission would ensure that the by-election would be credible. She, however, expressed concern over “the decline in voters turn-out during elections” conducted at the local, state and national levels, noting out that the trend was unacceptable. She pledged that the Commission would “intensify efforts and adopt new strategies towards sensitising and mobilising voters for more effective participation in the electoral process.” Political parties, she said, must do much more to complement the efforts of the commission towards eliminating voter apathy and enhancing voter participation in the electoral process. Justice Phillips urged political parties to adhere to the provisions of the guidelines issued by the commission on the by-election, adding that the programmes were time- bound and would be strictly adhered to.
