Members of Rivers State House of Assembly yesterday approved the suspension of the 12 local government chairmen suspended by Governor Nyesom Wike. Wike last week announced the suspension of the 12 chairmen for failing to participate in a state function, and sent a request to the House to seal the action. The affected councils are Okrika, Abua/Odual, Emohua, Degema, Khana, Gokana, Ahoada East, Ikwerre, Eleme, Andoni, Omuma and Ogu/Bolo. The request was read by the Speaker, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, for adoption, debate and approval by the lawmakers during plenary yesterday. Lawmakers who spoke said the governorâ€™s action was in line with the Local Government Laws, 2018, as made by the Assembly. Chairman of the House Committee on Local Government Kelechi Nwogu said the suspension will deter others who might feel they are above the law.
