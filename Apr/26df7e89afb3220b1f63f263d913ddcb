House of Representatives Leader Femi Gbajabiamila yesterday empowered 210 fish and vegetable farmers drawn in his Surulere Federal Constituency 1 of Lagos State. The beneficiaries went home with collapsible fish ponds, fish feeds, start-up capital, bags of fertiliser and insecticides. A Lagos State House of Assembly member, Mr Desmond Elliot, who represented Gbajabiamiala, at the event said: “The 210 constituents underwent training and were certified as trained fish and vegetable farmers. “This is the first time our people will be benefiting from collapsible fish pond, fish feeds and start-up capital. Our vegetable farmers at Tejuosho, NTA and Babs Animashaun will also receive fertiliser seedlings and herbicides.” He urged the beneficiaries not to sell the facilities, but to  use them to earn a living. Elliot promised them more projects, more jobs and legislation that would be beneficial to them if Gbajabiamiala becomes Speaker. According to him, “if he didn’t discriminate in Surulere, we are sure he will unite the lawmakers in the Green Chamber of the National Assembly.” He solicited the support of the North Central for Gbajabiamiala “because his wife is from Plateau State.” Said he: “We all know that for 16 years to date, the North Central has occupied the seat of Senate president and Chairman of the National Assembly. During this period, we supported them. Now is the time to reward a man who has spent many years in the National Assembly in pursuit of causes that will favour all parts of Nigeria.” The ceremony was attended by the Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Agboola Dabiri; Chairman, Surulere Local Government, Mr Tajudeen Ajide; Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) in Surulere, Mr S.S. Ajao  and Gbajabiamiala’s mother, Alhaja Latifat.
