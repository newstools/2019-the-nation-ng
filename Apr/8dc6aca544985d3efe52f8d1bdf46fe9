After coming from behind to beat Nigeria’s duo of Aruna Quadri and Olajide Omotayo in the main draw of the men’s doubles of the 2019 ITTF World Championships, Germany’s Timo Boll has admitted that experience played vital part in their triumph over the Africans. The Germans had to come from 2-1 down to beat the Nigerians 4-2 in the explosive encounter with the German legend – Timo Boll partnering Patrick Franziska in the match. “It was a tough match because we never expected them to give a serious challenge and this happened. From the start they are very strong but we had to restrategise to overcome. I think experience holds the key for us in the encounter. We had to rely on our experience in the game to muscle the victory from them. I am so happy we started well and I hope we will improve as we progress,” he admitted. Quadri and Omotayo gave the fans something to cheer in the encounter with their display against the experienced Germans. The backhand spin from Omotayo most times confused Timo Boll but the change of tactics from the Germans demystified the Nigerians in the match.
