The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says it has issued permits to Meter Asset Providers (MAP) of Ikeja and Benin Disco’s in accordance with Section 4(3) of the MAP regulations. A statement by Dr Usman Arab, NERC’s General Manager, Public Affairs, in Abuja on Friday said the permit was granted to the MAPs that were successful in the procurements conducted by Ikeja and Benin DisCos. Arab said Section 4(3) of the 2018 MAP regulations required all electricity distribution licensees to engage MAPs that would assist as investors to close the metering gap and thus eliminate the estimated billing in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). He said Ikeja DisCo has appointed Mojec International Limited to provide 399,790 meters, while Consolidated Infrastructure Group Ltd is to provide 397,922 meters. Similarly, New Hamshire   Capital Ltd would also supply 276,699 meters within the Ikeja   Disco’s coverage areas under MAP. He said Benin Disco has appointed FLT Energy System Ltd, G-Unit Engineering Ltd, Inlaks Power Solution Ltd, Sabrud Consortium Nigeria Ltd and Turbo Energy Ltd to provide meters within its coverage areas. He said NERC has directed that the rollout of meters shall begin on May 1. Arab said customers of Ikeja and Benin Discos should expect installation of the meters within 10 working days of making payment to MAPs in accordance with Section 18 (3) of the MAP regulations. According to him, MAPs shall charge an upfront of N36,991.50 for single phase meters and N67,055.85 for three-phase meters. “These costs of meters are inclusive of supply, installation, maintenance and replacement of meters over its technical life. “The commission shall monitor closely the roll out plan of distribution licensees and overall compliance with the regulations and various service agreements by the MAP and electricity distribution licensees,” he said.
