 Super Falcons and Barcelona ladies forward Assisat Oshoala has returned to training a development which has put smiles on the faces of technical crew of both teams. The three time African Women footballer of the year suffered a hamstring injury on the 17th of March in Barcelonaâ€™s game against Atletico Madrid. It was speculated then that the injury would keep her out of the game for at least five weeks, but the club interestingly confirmed on their twitter handle Tuesday that she has returned to light training and is likely to get into full action sooner than later. Oshoala who missed Falcons last set of friendly matches in Spain was seen in pictures released by the club jogging alongside teammates even as they intensify training ahead of their clash against Madrid CFF on Wednesday. Barcelona Ladies, who are occupying the second position on the Primera Division Femenina log behind table leaders Athletico Madrid, are going into Wednesday match fresh from a 6-0 demolition of Malaga last Saturday. Oshoala who joined the Spanish side from Chinese Super League Dalian Quanjian F.C has made over five appearances for the sides with five netting five goals. Although the 2015 BBC Women footballer of the year may not be on parade against Madrid tomorrow, there is however strong believe that she might get back into competitive in a pending tie against Sevilla at the end of the month.
