A 34 -year-old fashion designer, Gabriel John, charged with defrauding a woman of N900, 000, was on Wednesday in Lagos hauled up before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, who resides at Gbagada, Lagos, was arraigned before Magistrate M.O Tanimola on a two-count charge of stealing and obtaining money under false pretences. John, however, denied committing the offences and was admitted to a bail of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Tanimola said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Police Prosecutor, Insp. Aondohemba Koti, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Jan. 13, at Mushin, Lagos. He said that the defendant presented himself to be an American Embassy agent to defraud Miss Elizabeth Eromosele of her money. “The defendant collected the money from the complainant to help her process Canadian visa after claiming he is an agent of American Embassy,”Koti said. The prosecutor said that after the money was paid into the defendant’s account, he ran away to unknown location. “The defendant disappeared with the complainant’s money and efforts made by her to get her money proved unsuccessful, as the defendant refused to pick up her calls. “He was later arrested and handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. The offences violate sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing while section 314 prescribes 15 years for obtaining money under false pretences. The case was adjourned until April 24 for mention.
