A Sharia Court II sitting in Magajin Gari in Kaduna State on Thursday ordered a poultry farmer to pay his ex-lover N61,600, being amount he borrowed from her to start a poultry business. The Judge, Musa Sa’ad-Goma, ordered Shu’aibu Rani, 33, to pay, Zulaihat Umar N10,000 on the spot and subsequently pay her N5000 monthly to exhaust the amount. Umar, 24, had prayed the court to recover the amount from her ex-lover. Umar said that she borrowed Rani the sum of N86,600 to start up a poultry business in 2014, adding that the defendant agreed to pay her N5000 monthly until the amount was exhausted. “He had promised to pay me back after he sells the birds but he only gave me N25,000 and failed to pay the balance,” she said. Rani, who did not deny owing his ex-lover, said he separated from Umar after he got married to another woman. NAN
