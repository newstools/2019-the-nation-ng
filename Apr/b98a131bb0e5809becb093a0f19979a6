The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency has fined the Python Engineering Company Ltd the sum of N260m for oil spillages caused by its vessel, MV Celine. NOSDRA sanctioned the oil company for spilling an estimated 250 barrels of AGO and two drums of lubricating oil which occurred at Escraves Breakwater, Delta State on April 19, 2018. Additional violations include failure to carry out the Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) as required by the Oil Spill Recovery, Cleanup, Remediation, and Damage Assessment Regulations and failure to clean up the spills as required by section 6 (3) of the 2006 NOSDRA Act. The Director General of NOSDRA, Mr. Peter Idabor, in a notification letter, directed Python to pay to the agency the N130m each within twenty-one days for the AGO and the lubricating oil releases as sanctions for violating Sections 6 (2) of the NOSDRA Act of 2006. NOSDRA also required the violating company to provide logistics within three days for a damage assessment visit as required by the Agency rules and regulations.
