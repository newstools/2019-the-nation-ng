As a cadet player, Olajide Omotayo used to admire the skills of Germany’s Timo Boll and he was fond of watching his videos but on Monday April 22 at the 2019 ITTF World Championships in Budapest, the 23-year-old played against his longtime idols in the main draw of the men’s doubles event. Despite forcing the Germans to rely on their experience to overcome them, Omotayo told NationSport that he was so excited playing against Timo Boll. “I was looking up to Timo Boll when I started playing table tennis because he was such a legend of the game. His style of play is a beauty to behold and I am so excited when I found out that we are going to face them in the main draw of the men’s doubles. I made sure I give my best but I realized that this great German star still has a lot to offer despite ageing,” Omotayo said. The Italy-based star believes playing well against Boll has inspired him. “I think when we were leading Timo changed something in the match and this diffuse our tactics. The German has shown that he has experience and this really came to fore against us in the match. After we lost the fourth game for the match to be at 2-2, we lost concentration and this really affected us to lose the match. I am so excited playing against Timo and it was a rare privilege playing against such a great player and I think this will motivate me to aim higher in my career,” the 2018 African Championship semifinalist said.
