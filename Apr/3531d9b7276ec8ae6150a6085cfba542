 Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho played for just six minutes as Leicester City held West Ham United to a 2-2 draw on Saturday. The former Manchester City ace that has become a source of worry for super Eagles technical crew following his minimal playing time was thrown into the match in the 84th minute as replacement for Demarai Gray who had enjoyed a starting shirt. As usual however compatriot Wilfred Ndidi was in action for the entire duration of the match.Â  The homers had shot into the lead in the 37th minute of the match through Michail Antonio who got an assist from Mark Noble. West Ham managed to hold on to the lead till the end of the first 45 minutes but on resumption of the second half Jamie Vardy leveled up in the 67th minute. Lucas Perez restored the lead for West Ham in the 82nd minute and it looked all that the homers were running away with a win and three points in the kitty to the delight of their vociferous fans, but that was not to be as Harvey Barnes chose the two minutes of added time to spoil the party for West Ham fans. Earlier Manchester City, who had their Champions league hopes dashed by Tottenham midweek, got a well-deserved revenge beating Spurs by a lone goal. Combined effort from Sergio Aguero and Philip Foden was all that was needed to shoot the citizens into the lead as early as the fifth minute. And just like they did in the Champions league tie, Tottenham created chances that came close to turning the table but City just held on till the end to temporarily reclaim the summit of the league pending the outcome of the matches lined up on Easter Sunday. Everton host Manchester United, Arsenal host Crystal Palace while Liverpool will be guests of Cardiff.
