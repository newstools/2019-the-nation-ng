AY, Reekado Banks, Peruzzi and Dj Cuppy are set to thrill fans alongside other superstars at Kanu Heart Foundation’s first ever charity concert. The event tagged ‘Using music to save a heart’ will hold on May 19, 2019 at the Indigo2 at The O2, London. The convener of the concert, ex-Arsenal and Nigerian footballer Kanu Nwankwo, said that he is determined to change the lives of many, by funding heart surgeries for children suffering across Africa with funds raised from the concert. Asking for support early this year, Kanu said 20 patients of the Kanu Heart Foundation were operated on by March but there are 200 still on the waiting list for surgeries.
