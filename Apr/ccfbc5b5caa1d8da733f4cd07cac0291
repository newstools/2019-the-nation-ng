Afrobeats musician Seun Kuti has said that Nigerian elites should do more thanutter words to address the various forms of extrajudicial killings in the country. Addressing the story emanating from Zamfara State in which 50 persons were reportedly killed recently, Seun, who is also the son of founder of Afrobeats and activist, Fela Kuti, took to his Instagram account to give the call. “What do u call a parasite with millions and millions of dollars?” He asked. “A Nigerian elite. The country just continues to live through collective trauma and live in a collective post traumatic space and we all have to drink and dance everyday and get high to mask this real psychological attacks that enforces the indoctrination that we don’t matter. You can pray for Zamfara but until we are ready to do something about it, it won’t change. Do something about Zamfara, don’t just pray #getthesax.” The security situation across many states of Nigeria has been deplorable and killings have taken place at frightening scales in some northern states such as Zamfara, Kaduna, Benue, Plateau, Taraba, Yobe, Borno and Adamawa.
