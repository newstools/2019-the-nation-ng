Some retired workers of Radio Lagos and Lagos Television yesterday appealed to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to fund the organisations, to enable them offset their terminal benefits before May 29. They spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, claiming that there had been a delay in processing the benefits. Mr. Biodun Akinbusuyi, who spoke on behalf of the retirees, said they were transferred from two parastatal-agencies to the main service in 2016. He said the Lagos State Pension Commission returned the retirees’ files to the two parastatal-agencies and that their terminal benefits should be paid by the organisations. “We are appealing to Ambode to assist the parastatal-agencies by approving the terminal benefits, which is not up to N100 million, before the administration winds down. “We are not more than 20 retirees affected by this development,” Akinbusuyi said. Information and Strategy Commissioner Mr. Kehinde Bamigbetan had at the last congress of the Lagos State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, promised the retirees that their terminal benefits would be paid. He said the ministry would assist in ensuring that issues causing the delay in treating the files of the affected retirees were sorted out. According to him, although Radio Lagos/Lagos Television is financially insolvent to pay the retirees’ terminal benefits, the governor will do his best before handing over.
