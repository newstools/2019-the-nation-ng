In its bid to achieve quality health inclusion and improved hygiene for all Nigerians, Dettol has joined the rest of the world to celebrate the World Health Day. Speaking on the theme for this year’s celebration, ‘Universal Health Coverage’, General Manager, RB West Africa, Dayanand Sriram, said there is a need to improve global health and ensure that people get the right healthcare, where and when they need it without any form of financial barrier. Sriram stated that “Dettol is happy to join the rest of the world in celebrating the 2019 World Health Day. At RB, we see this as a good opportunity to renew our commitment to helping Nigerians live healthier lives through the adoption of good hygiene practices. We believe that simple activities, such as regular washing of hands, go a long way in preventing the spread of diseases like diarrhoea amongst children and adults. He said that, according to UNICEF, the prevalence rate of diarrhoea in Nigeria is 18.8%, accounting for an estimated 150,000 deaths yearly amongst children under five due to poor hygienic and sanitary practices. Dayanand added that Dettol recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Federal Ministry of Water Resources to launch the ‘Clean Naija Program’, a national hygiene initiative designed to create awareness and educate the public on the importance of handwashing in order to promote personal hygiene and achieve a cleaner and healthier Nigeria.
