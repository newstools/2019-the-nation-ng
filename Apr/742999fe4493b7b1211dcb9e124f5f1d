A woman, Ijeoma Udeabor, who allegedly obtained N4.5 million under the guise of investing it in a gold multi-level marketing (MLM) online business, was yesterday arraigned at an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Udeabor, 33, was arraigned by the police before Mrs. O. O. Oshin, on a three-count charge of fraud. Prosecutor Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), George Nwosu, alleged that Udeabor committed the offence in January 2017 in Lagos. He said Udeabor obtained N4.5m from two women under the guise of investing the money in Swiss Golden Investment, an online investment that purportedly deals in buying and selling of gold bars. The court heard that Udeabor promised the complainants, Mrs. Chika Okoli and Mrs. Ifeayinwa Ukanna that she would refund their capital with an interest of N1.5 million each after 60 days of investing the capital. Nwosu alleged that the defendant obtained N2.25 million from each complainant through her Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) account. Udeabor pleaded not guilty. Her counsel, Mr. I. E. Okoroafor, applied for the defendant’s bail “in the most liberal terms.” Okoroafor prayed the court to allow him stand as surety for the defendant, saying he was aware of the implications of such decision. He presented his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Discharge Certificate, Call to Bar Certificate and Bachelor of Laws (BL) Certificate to prove his preparedness to guarantee Udeabor’s appearance for trial. In a bench ruling, Magistrate Oshin granted the defendant N200,000 bail with one surety in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on June 3.
