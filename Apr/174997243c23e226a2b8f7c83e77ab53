Standards organisation of Nigeria (SON) Director-General (DG), Mr Osita Aboloma, has warned manufacturers of products that have direct impact on safety and health of consumers against sharp practices to avoid disasters. Aboloma gave the warning in Ado Ekiti at a one-day sensitisation programme on the “Importance of Metrology for Quality Assurance for stakeholders in the Southwest”. He said the agency was worried at the increasing inconsistency in the measures and units used in evaluating products and services in the country. He said: “SON is deeply alarmed at this practice, which has significantly reduced economic growth and integrity of services in the country.” He described metrology as a science of measurement, which must not be ignored during any production process. According to him, measurement is an important part of everyday lives; the iron rod maker, the fuel dealer, the agro-produce farmer, the exporter, the gas distributor, the engineer on site, among others. He advised  all to ensure that measurement of products and services are done accurately if they will deliver quality and value to the customers. The D-G, who was represented by SON Southwest Regional Co-ordinator, Mrs Tosan Akosile, maintained that measurement has always been needed to facilitate trade. Business and commercial processes cannot be regarded to be fair and honest when the weights and measures are inappropriate. In his paper: “Importance of Metrology in Quality Assurance”, Mr Olalekan Omoniyi, said  many of the nation’s products meant for export had often been rejected, largely because of inaccurate measurement, arising from lack of functional quality control policy. He said metrology and measurement should work together  to deliver quality service in so much that consumers do not get cheated or harmed.
