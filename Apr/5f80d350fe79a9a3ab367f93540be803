The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said that Lagosians made the right decision by voting Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu as governor. The party spoke through Chief Sunny Ajose, its Deputy Chairman, at an ”Appreciation Dinner” held on Saturday night, to thank the residents for voting Sanwo-Olu and his running mate, Dr Obafemi Hamzat. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the dinner was organised by some chieftains of the party including Commissioner for Science and Technology Mr Hakeem Fahm and Mr Dele Alake, a former Commissioner of Information and Strategy in the state. Ajose described Sanwo-Olu and Obafemi Hamzat as technocrats with great leadership experience, saying that they would serve the state meritoriously. ”We thank Lagos residents for voting Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat and we want to assure the people that they will fulfill their promises and meet expectations. ”Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat are tested and trusted leaders. Now that they have been given the mandate to pilot the affairs of the state, they will drive responsibly,” he said. Ajose commended party members for their contributions to the success of the APC, and urged them to support the leaders so as to get the best from them. In his remarks, APC chieftain Chief Pius Akinyelure, congratulated Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat on their electoral victory, saying that their overwhelming success reflected the confidence voters had in them. Akinyelure particularly thanked Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, a leader of the party, for his efforts toward ensuring victory for the party in both the presidential and the governorship elections. He described Tinubu as “a great political strategist and a visionary leader”, saying that his foresight had helped to entrench effective governance in the state. NAN reports that prominent personalities at the dinner included Oba Rilwan Akiolu of Lagos and a one-time Commissioner of Finance, Mr Wale Edun.
