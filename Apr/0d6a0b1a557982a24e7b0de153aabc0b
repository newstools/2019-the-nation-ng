The management of The Polytechnic Ibadan yesterday suspend activities of institution’s Student Union Government. The institution’s management also directed all students to proceed on mid-semester break with immediate effect. Announcing the management’s decision, the institution’s spokesperson, Mr. Adewole Soladoye, said the suspension became necessary as the student union body had failed to obey and follow the rules guiding its activities on campus. According to him, the management directed the immediate suspension because of the ongoing football competition, which had been disturbing the peace of the institution ahead of next week’s examination. He urged the students to stay committed to their examination, which begins shortly. He added that the management would not hesitate to punish anyone, who flouts the rules guiding the institution. In a statement yesterday and signed by the institution’s Registrar, Mrs. Modupe Fawale, the management said the police have been invited to ensure smooth vacation of the students from the campus to prevent breach of peace. The statement directed the students to report back for studies on April 10, 2019, urging parents and guardians to requests their children to return home.
