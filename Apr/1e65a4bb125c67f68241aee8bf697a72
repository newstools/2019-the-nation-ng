A secondary school teacher, Mr Ajayi Akintunde, was on Thursday granted N500, 000 bail in Lagos, over an alleged sexual assault of an 18-year-old secondary girl. An Ikeja Chief Magistrate’s Court, which granted the bail, asked him to provide two sureties as part of the conditions. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Yewande Aje-Afunwa, ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and should show evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State Government. She added that one of the sureties should be related to the defendant. The defendant, whose address was not provided, is facing a charge of unlawful sexual assault. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Asp. Peter Nwangwu told the court that the offence was committed in 2018 at Fazi-I-Omat High School Iwaya, Lagos. Nwangwu said the defendant was arrested by the police after a case was reported at Iwaya Police Station. He said that the defendant had unlawful oral sex with the girl, when he forced her to suck his private part. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Section prescribes a 3-year jail term for any offenders. The girl had told the police on two different occasions that she succumbed to pressure and gave the teacher oral sex. She said that the teacher further demanded sex if she ever wanted to graduate from the school with her classmates, but she refused. The spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command, DSP Bala Elkana, confirmed that the teacher was arrested and paraded at the police command. NAN
