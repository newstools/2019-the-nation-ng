Prestige Anchor International will hold its fourth Prestige Anchor Leadership, Empowerment and Capacity building (PALEC) awards and Leadership Conference at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile- Ife, on Friday 17th  and Saturday 18th,  next month. According to a statement by the programme convener, Adebayo Nathaniel, the award will celebrate individuals and firms that have helped solve youth-related problems. “PALEC award is committed to recognising and rewarding students, individuals, firms, who have helped in one way or the other to solve societal problems faced by our vibrant and talented youths of today and empower them by building their skills and capacity,” the statement stated. Adebayo added that the award is to encourage youths to be actively involved in community development: “The award is imperative to serve as an encouragement for upcoming youths to rise and take charge of the community in a bid to cause a paradigm shift and social change. The conference is set to preach leadership and panel discussions to set student leaders in focus and build their capacity.” According to him, the conference with the theme: ‘The Maverick’, would begin with essay competition on the first day, while the following day, which is the grand finale, would feature activities such as talent hunt and entrepreneur empowerment/exhibition, among others. It will be recalled that the previous editions of the event, which  held in Minna, Niger State, Abuja, and Benin respectively, brought together over 2000 young and vibrant leaders with over 175 young leaders, firms, individuals, and activists presented with awards.
