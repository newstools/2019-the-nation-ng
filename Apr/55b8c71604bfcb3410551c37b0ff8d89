Following the post of her #fvckyouchallenge, via her Instagram account, singer Simi has apologised for the use of the line: “abi o ro bi mo kola ni”, a Yoruba phrase for ‘Do you think I have tribal marks’. The singer noted that the words used in the video did not go well with some people, saying it was insensitive on her part. Taking to Instagram to address the issue, she wrote: “Guys I had to bring down my post cos I used the line “abi o ro bi mo kola ni” “Do you think I have tribal marks?)- Which people meant to say “Am I stupid”. “It’s an old Yoruba ‘joke’, but I never acknowledge how insensitive it is. It offended some and I shouldn’t have used it. Lots of unlearning to do. We should remember to be sensitive and empathetic to others.” “Also I know the video is all over the place already, but it’s a step in the right direction and I apologize to anyone that was/is offended by it I only ever mean well.” Commending the singer for coming out to address the issue without feeling offended by people calling her out for using such words, its_rumens wrote, “I love your maturity and the fact that you did the needful. Respect!!!
