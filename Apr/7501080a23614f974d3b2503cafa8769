Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) has pledged its public advocacy and enforcement against noise and environmental pollution. It said it will continue to do this until the state becomes noise free. LASEPA General Manager Ayodele Anthonio, who spoke yesterday in Alausa, Ikeja, at the 2019 International Noise Awareness Day organised by the agency in conjunction with Ministry of Environment, with the theme: “Protect your hearing, protect your health”, said noise pollution was one of the threats affecting residents. Anthonio, an engineer, said the agency would not relent in the fight “against this ugly trend until it becomes a thing of the past.” He said Lagos, being the commercial nerve centre of the country, with one of the largest population, was exposed to noise and environmental pollution on a daily basis, adding that the agency would not relent in public advocacy and enforcement “against this menace, as it has negative impact on health and well-being of the citizens.” A senior audiologist from Decibels Consultant, Lagos, Dr. Graham Amponsah, advised the public to be mindful of the drugs they take, saying some anti-malaria and antibiotics drugs can cause hearing loss. He lamented the high rate at which people lose their hearing because of abnormal use of musical gadgets and earpiece, noting that too much noise affects the brain, hearing and health.
