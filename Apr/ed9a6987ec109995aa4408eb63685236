The Lagos State Central Mosque has offered prayers for Oba Rilwanu Akiolu’s victory in court. An Ikeja High Court on March 29 declared Akiolu as the bona fide king of Lagos after 16-year legal battle. During special prayers after  the Jumat service last Friday, the congregation thanked God for seeing Akiolu through the tussle. The Bashorun of Lagos, Alhaji Sikiru Alabi-Macfoy, said : “We are praying for a successful reign of Oba Akiolu after winning the 16-year court case. We are happy that the decision made by the Lagos State Government that he’s the most competent and the lawful person to assume the throne has been validated by the court’’. He added : “He (Akiolu) has modernised the palace. He interacts with religious bodies. His doors are always open to all Lagosians. So, we thank God who vindicated us and established him as the rightful Oba of Lagos. We thank God and pray that he will continue to excel in his duties to the glory of this country and Lagos State’’. The Bashorun of Lagos urged Lagosians to move closer to him and tap from his wisdom.
