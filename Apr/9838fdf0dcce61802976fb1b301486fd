The Nation reports that the irate trucks drivers with over 200 trucks blocked all roads leading to the Inland Containers Limited (Bonded Terminal) along Abdullahi Bayero road over the long delay on their clearance. However, armed policemen have been deployed to the terminal to avert possible breakdown of law and order. The protesters accused the importers, clearing agents and terminal operators as well as customs of the lackadaisical attitude of implementing a speedy clearance of those containers that have blocked Kano roads for the past two months. Most of the drivers lamented the pathetic situation they have been going through for the past two months in Kano without been attended to and vowed not to remove their vehicles from the roads until the authorities concerned attend to their plights. Malam Bala lsa and Yusuf Musa, truck drivers, told this reporter, that “we conveyed these containers from Lagos. Some of us have spent over two months waiting for the clearing agents, the terminal operators and the custom officials to harmonize their differences and clear the containers but to no avail. “Look, we have exhausted all we have.  We have no money to feed ourselves “ Reacting to this development, the custom’s Public Relations Officer, in charge of Kano /Jigawa command, Isah Danbaba said that the ongoing protest by truck drivers was not against the customs. “The protest is the concern of terminal operators, importers/ clearing agents’ so we have nothing to do about this situation, adding that those concerned are also expected by customs to come forward with appropriate custom documents and clear their goods.
