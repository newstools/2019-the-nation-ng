Three lawyers were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly assaulting an Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) operative in the line of duty. The lawyers were said to have obstructed the operatives from arresting a former Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja branch, Yinka Farounbi, on March 4. They are Lateef Abdulsalam, 55, Evans Okwuede, 45, and Abiodun Kolawole, 48. The defendants, who are all members of the Ikeja NBA,  are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, resisting a public officer and assault before Chief Magistrate O. A. Layinka. They were alleged to have assaulted Mrs. Patience Kalu during the monthly meeting of Ikeja NBA. Prosecuting Inspector Akeem Raji alleged that the defendants assaulted Mrs. Kalu while trying to arrest Farounbi, over allegations of financial misappropriation. Raji claimed that the defendants injured Kalu on her hand and neck. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Layinka granted them N100,000 bail with one surety each in the like sum. She said the sureties must be lawyers and provide their NBA seal as proof. The case continues on May 15.
