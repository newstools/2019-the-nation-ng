Some residents of Mushin yesterday protested at the head office of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), Marina, Lagos Island, alleging estimated billing, power outage and assault by officials of the company. The residents, who identified with Mushin Constituency 2 and were joined by a group – Advocacy for Anti-Bribe Corruption and Crime Prevention Initiative (AABCCPI) – thronged the EKEDC office at 11am. The protesters also alleged that officials of the EKEDC regularly extorted money from them, using armed policemen. Our reporter, who visited the protest scene, saw hundreds of protesters carrying placards. They chanted: “EKEDC Ole. Enough of abysmal extortion and assault. Mushin people no be thugs. We are gentle people.” The inscriptions on some of the placards read: “We cannot continue paying for darkness.” “Our mumu don do.” “We deserve 24hrs electricity.” “No light no NEPA bills.” “No estimated billing payment.” Mrs. Adoronke Osoba, a lawyer, said they had written EKEDC several times, calling for a dialogue on how to resolve the issue of “outrageous estimated billing” in Mushin. “We have written several letters. All our yearnings and cries have fallen on deaf ears. They never took us serious. We’ve engaged community leaders and their branch office at Idi-Araba. We tried all means of having dialogue on this matter, but to no avail. This is why we are protesting. People think we are thugs in Mushin. We are not. We are enlightened and gentle people.” Efforts to reach the principal officers and the management of EKEDC proved abortive, as heavily armed security operatives stationed on the premises locked people out of the gate.
