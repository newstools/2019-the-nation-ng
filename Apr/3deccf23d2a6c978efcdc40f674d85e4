The All Progressives Congress (APC) says allegation that Kwara governor-elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq forged his Senior Secondary School Certificate (SSSC) is laughable. The APC said those spreading the falsehood were engaged in a futile exercise. The governor-elect was alleged to have forged the SSSC he presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the state’s gubernatorial election. Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary said in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, that the allegation was politically motivated. “Our attention has been drawn to the politically sponsored allegation against the APC Kwara governor- elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, that he forged the SSSC he presented for election. “We understand the desperation of the sponsors of this campaign of calumny to get power through the back door after the crushing defeat they suffered from Kwara electorate in the last general elections. “While it is the right of the rejected opposition and their proxies to approach the election tribunal relying on their flimsy and false claims, we assure Kwarans that it is an exercise in futility,” he said. Issa-Onilu said the allegation would surely come to nought, adding that challenging the popular mandate given to Abdulrazaq amounted to mere shadow boxing. He noted that the outcome of the elections in Kwara was an expression of a collective resolve of Kwara electorate for a new progressive order that had long eluded the state. He, however, stressed that the APC was confident in the Kwara governor-elect, affirming that all documents he submitted to INEC for the election were authentic. He, therefore, urged APC members in Kwara not to exercise any doubt about the governor-elect, but to gear up for the task of setting the state on a path to progress under Abdulrazaq.
