Residents of ‎Nariya Community, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis on Sunday came out in large number to protest against the kidnapping of two pregnant women, three others in the area. The protesters blocked the busy Nnamdi Azikwe Express Way (Western Bypass) Sunday morning to demonstrate their anger. The protesters said kidnapping has now become a daily routine in the community as kidnappers operate with impunity in the area. The Nation gathered that, the protest was prompted as two pregnant women and three men were abducted in their respective houses around 2:00am on Sunday. One of the protesters who does not want his name in the print said, he saw the kidnappers with guns. “I saw them with guns because they attacked my neighbours house and took away two pregnant women, other women from another house and a man. We are tired of kidnappers operating freely in the community. “We are only blocking the road to drew the attention of the government on our plight. We want the governor to come to our aid” he said. The road has however been cleared as the protesters were dispersed by men of the Nigeria Police.
