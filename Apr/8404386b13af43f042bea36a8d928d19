Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh has said government should make primary health accessible to every citizen. She said this on World Health Day which held on Sunday, April 7, 2019, with the theme ‘universal health coverage.’ “This year, the World Health Day focuses on “universal health coverage” meaning that all people have access to the quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. We believe this is possible and it starts with strong primary health care,” she said. “Primary health care is a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being centered on the needs and preferences of individuals, families and communities. To make health for all a reality, governments need to invest in quality, accessible primary health care. Health workers need to care and advocate for patients and educate them on how to get and stay healthy. Individuals and communities need to be empowered to take care of their own health individually such as exercising, washing of hands, healthy feeding, self-examination of breasts in females for lumps, brushing of teeth at least once a day, keeping a clean environment to prevent diseases, regular check-up etc. “Health is a human right. Together, we can make health for all a reality.”
