The Federal High Court in Birnin Kebbi has again adjourned to April 5 a case challenging the validity of Sen. Bala Na’Allah’s candidacy for Kebbi South Senatorial District. Alhaji Sule Sami has challenged Na’Allah’s validity to contest for a second term at the All Progressives Congress primary election conducted in October 2018. Justice Bassey Onu adjourned the matter upon oral application made by the first and third respondents, Sanusi Samaila and Ifeoluwa Adeyemo and which the second respondent, Mr Afraimu Jingi, collaborated with the submission seeking for adjournment of the matter to one week. Responding to the submission, Onu adjourned the hearing to enable both respondents file their replies on the amendment of the writ of summon. He also ordered that all the replies be filed before the court on or before the adjourned date. “You all know that this matter must be heard and determined within 180 days from the date of filing the case and this matter was filed on Nov. 1, 2018 and has less than a month to expire now. “Justice must be served within the stipulated time,” Onu said. The counsel to the plaintiff, Usman Hajji, expressed confidence on the court to determine the matter within the stipulated time. NAN
