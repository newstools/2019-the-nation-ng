Students of the Ondo State University of Science and Technology (OSUSTECH) Okitipupa, on Monday disrupted academic and other administrative activities on the campus to protest against hike in the school fee. The protest came few days after that of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA), which forced its management to close down the institution and ordered students to vacate the campus premises. OSUSTECH’s management had however shut the institution to restore peace and directed the students to vacate the campus with immediate effect. Sources said the students in their large number staged a protest over the school fees payable in the institution. They were angry over the management’s decision to retain the amount of fees they paid in their first year. One of the students said: “We are protesting against the management because the school fees we are paying is too much. “What we paid last year was between N150, 000 and N200, 000 being new students and now that we are in 200 levels the fee should at least be reduced. “The management is saying we are paying the same amount we paid last year, hence the reason for the protest.” The Registrar of the University, Felix Akinnusi expressed displeasure over the protest embarked upon the students. Akinnusi disclosed that the Senate of the institution has taken a decision to shut down the varsity for two weeks. “It was a surprise to us this morning that our students are protesting. We don’t know the reason and we will be meeting the students’ leaders to know the reason for the protest”. The Registrar said, “In view of this development, the Senate has ordered the students to proceed on two weeks mid-semester break. The circular will be released soon. We will use this break to meet with their leaders and resolve all issues,” he said.
