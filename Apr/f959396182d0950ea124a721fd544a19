A 26-year old man, Sylvester Arikhan, who was arrested with a police serviceable pistol, said yesterday that he was given the gun to protect ballot boxes during the House of Assembly election in Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo State. He alleged that he was given the gun by one Ehis, who promised to pay him N130,000. Arikhan, who spoke to reporters when he was paraded by Police Commissioner Danmallam Abubakar, said he carried out the job because he needed money to travel out of the country, “as I’ve just been released from prison for cult-related offences.” Arikhan said he concealed the gun in his trousers as a party agent at Ward 02, Unit 01, at Udomi Primary School, Irrua, in Esan Central Local Government, in anticipation of violence. “After the election, we followed the ballot boxes and nothing happened, but I did not return the gun because I was paid only N10,000. I hid from Ehis. He is a bad guy. He tried to set me up. “When we attended a wedding, my friend brought N6,000 for me to buy bullets and fired some shots. I did so and gave the gun to Oboh Samurie to keep for me. “Oboh took a girl to a hotel and the police arrested him after they found the gun on him,” he said. The police commissioner said the suspects would soon be arraigned.
