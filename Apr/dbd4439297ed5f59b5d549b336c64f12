The Nigerian female wrestling team has retained its title as the best team at the 2019 African Wrestling Championship which ended yesterday in Hammamet in Tunisia. Nine of the 10 registered wrestlers won different medals. Also for her display coupled with the way she handled most of her opponents, Odunayo Adekuoroye was adjudged the most outstanding wrestler of the tournament. The nine female wrestlers won five gold, two silver and two bronze medals, with only of them missing out from the podium. It was Sunmisola Balogun that claimed the first gold medal for Nigeria in the 65kg after beating Burkina Faso’s Yvette Zie 1-0, while Blessing Oborududu continued her dominance in the continent with her ninth gold medal at the continental championship. To claim the gold medal, Oborududu, a Commonwealth Games gold medallist, defeated Senegal’s Anta Sambo 10-0 in the 68kg. In the 57kg, Adekuoroye was outstanding from the first round when she defeated Algeria’s Chaimaa Aouissi and in the final she overwhelmed Cameroun’s Joseph Emilienne Essombe Tiako, to be flawless in all her fights. This prompted the organisers to pick the Nigerian as the most outstanding wrestler of the tournament. Also, Mercy Genesis in the 50kg beat Egypt’s Nada Mohamed to claim the gold medal. Blessing Onyebuchi won the fifth gold medal for Nigeria in the 76kg after beating Egypt’s Mona Ahmed in the final.
