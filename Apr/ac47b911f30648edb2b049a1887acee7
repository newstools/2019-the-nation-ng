THE Lagos State Government has approved about 145 Transport Impact Assessment (TIA) applications in its bid to transform the sector, ensure safety of lives and improve service delivery. Commercial, residential buildings, places of worship,  recreational and institutional centres are to obtain the TIA report, which will determine the traffic impact of their land use and plan for mitigating same. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Taiwo Olufemi Salaam, told reporters yesterday at Alausa, Ikeja that “this is part of the holistic measures put in place by the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration to tackle transportation planning and give Lagosians a new transportation experience.” He said since the population was growing 10 times faster than those of New York, Los Angeles and 32 African countries combined, the growth rate plus the chaotic character of the urban transport system led to the TIA study, especially for commercial, residential buildings, particularly high rise with more than five floors, event centres, petrol/gas stations and worship centres. Salaam said TIA would aid the generation of data for transport planning policy and implementation, as well as traffic volume count, road safety audit review and origin and destination survey. He said 188 applications were received out of which the 145 were processed and approved.
