The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) have hailed the Lagos State Government for the massive investment in road infrastructure. The state chairmen of NURTW and RTEAN, Alhaji Tajudeen Agbede and Alhaji Mohammed Musa, gave the commendation yesterday in Ikeja, Lagos, in interviews with reporters. They spoke against the backdrop of key road infrastructure executed by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday. The union leaders said the 10-lane expansion of Airport Road, inauguration of Oshodi Transport Interchange, new buses and terminals are milestones in the development of public transportation. Agbede, who praised Ambode for investing in the transport sector, said efficient transportation was crucial to the socio-economic development of any state. He said the new 820 buses and road infrastructure would boost transportation and reduce difficulties faced by residents. “Our union appreciates the governor for the delivery of these projects and buses. “It is a welcome development and it will complement the existing ones to help Lagosians move from one place to another comfortably,” the NURTW chairman said. Musa, who commended the government for its investment in road infrastructure and public transportation, appealed to the federal and state governments to fix bad roads in the state and country.
