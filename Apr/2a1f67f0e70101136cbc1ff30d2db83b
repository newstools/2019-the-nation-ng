The head of Oke Ahun community in Efon Alaaye, Ekiti State, Alahun Jacob Adelowo (Omole II) yesterday complained about the seizure of his monthly statutory salaries by Efon Local Government, Ekiti State. He alleged that his salaries for seven months have been stopped by the council on the advice of the paramount ruler, the Alaaye of Efon Kingdom, Oba Emmanuel Aladejaye (Agunsoye 11). Alahun Adelowo said the withholding of his salaries followed his agitation for autonomy for his community. He described Oke Ahun as a distinct community in Efon Alaaye. Other quarters clamouring for autonomy in Efon Alaaye are Aaye, Obalu, Isaja, Ejigan, Emo and Ikagbe. The state government has set up a committee headed by Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi to investigate the merit of their claims and counter-claims. Alahun Adelowo, who recently presented 10 ceiling fans and cash gifts the patients at the  Efon General Hospital, said he had embarked on a peaceful agitation. The monarch urged other eminent citizen of Efon to help donate one thing or the other to the hospital. He said the donation was meant to support Governor Kayode Fayemi, who, he said, has resolved to reposition the health sector in the state. The brief ceremony was witnessed by many chiefs from Ahun Community, including High Chief Alanaka, High Chief Oloro, Chief Elejofi, ‘Olori’ Olayinka Adelowo and Efon All Progressives Congress (APC) leader and Erungbua of Obalu Quarter, High Chief Joseoh Alake,  who promised to donate a modern electronic oxygen  bank to the hospital. Alahun Adelowo urged the state government to prevail on Efon Council to pay his salaries. He said: “My chieftaincy stipend allowance and those of my chiefs have been withed for the past seven years on the advice of the Alaaye of Efon Alaaye simply because of my agitation for autonomy and recognition of Alahun of Ahun as the tradition ruler of Ahun community. We urge the government to look into the Ahun community’s long suffering.”
