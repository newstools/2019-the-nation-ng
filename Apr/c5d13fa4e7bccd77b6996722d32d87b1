According to the Mada monarch, “the situation is quite unfortunate, devastating that a peaceful, law abiding and innocent community like mine, which over decades have never involved in skirmishes either internally or externally, would be attacked when in celebration mood of a naming ceremony by men suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.”
