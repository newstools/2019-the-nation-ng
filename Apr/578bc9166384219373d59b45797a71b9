Ridwan “Scorpion” Oyekola, the winner of the best boxer award at GOtv Boxing Night 15, has expressed the desire to reclaim the award at GOtv Boxing Night 18. The award carries a cash prize of N1million. In a telephone chat, Oyekola, who won N1 million when he emerged the best boxer at GOtv Boxing Night 15, said he will be at his best when he takes on Taofeek ‘Taozon’ Bisuga in the national super featherweight title bout scheduled for the event,  which holds at the Indoor Sports Hall of Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan, on Sunday. “I have won it before and I want to win it again and I will win again. I thank the sponsors for what they are doing, as they have changed the lives of Nigerian boxers for the better. Taozon will fall. I will sting him till he falls,” he said.
