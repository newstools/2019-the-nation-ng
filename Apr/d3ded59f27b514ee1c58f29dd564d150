In his words “the remarkable results that we have been able to achieve in about two years since we were appointed to run the affairs of the Bank. They demonstrate our determination to justify the confidence of President Muhammadu Buhari in our capacity to reform the FMBN as an effective tool in the hands of government to tackle the lingering housing deficit. The FMBN remains the best route to affordable homeownership for the Nigerian worker and we seek the support of all housing industry stakeholders in our bid to transform and reposition it to deliver on its mandate of providing affordable social housing”
