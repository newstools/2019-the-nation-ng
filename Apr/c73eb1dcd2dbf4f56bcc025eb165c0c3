The Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe has expressed displeasure over alleged abscondment to duty by health workers in some health centres in Anambra state. Achebe, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues when health workers paid them courtesy visit in Awka, said the rate at which health workers abandon their duty posts was regrettable. He said, “Whenever I stopped to ascertain how the health workers were faring in some of the centres, I often met nobody at their duty posts.” While commending them for the visit, Achebe who doubles as Chairman, Anambra State Traditional Rulers Council, urged the workers to always do the needful for the good of the people. He also enjoined them to intimate the council on their activities at various health centres for improved healthcare delivery. Acting Chairman, Anambra State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (ASPHDA), Dr Emmanuel Okafor, said the agency would soon commence checks on all the health centres. He warned that anybody found wanting at their duty posts would be sanctioned. He said, “The state health workers have no reason to absent themselves from work going by government’s commitment toward them.” Okafor who said the visit was to intimate the monarchs on the activities of the health centers, described as cordial the relationship between the state government and health workers. Appreciating government for salary increase and promise of payment of the new minimum wage, ASPHDA boss appealed for employment of more health workers to replace the retiring ones.
