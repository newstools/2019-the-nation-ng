A data-scientist, Mr. Adewale Omoniyi, has said that the spate of insecurity in the country can only be curbed by the usage of data to create economic and social opportunities that will discourage crime and vices. Omoniyi, who was the governorship candidate of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP) in Ogun State at the last election, said the newly elected governors must reinvent their states to create a new lease of system. Speaking with newsmen, the renowned statistician said, “I will continue to urge the incoming governors-elect that when they come on board, they should reinvent the system especially the security of their states which will in turn impact on the security of the nation. “I urge them to first be organised in their approach to governance because it is apparent that the current system is not working especially as it relates to security. “The governors-elect, especially those in the South-West, must know that you cannot successfully preside over the people you don’t know. They must connect with the people to have a seamless administration. “That is why we are always saying that if government must serve the people effectively, it must have the real data of the real people. When you know the number of the people you are dealing with, it will be easier for you to fulfill your campaign promises. “If states are organised on the basis of data, we will know the percentage of the unemployed and cater for them. When they are employed, crime will automatically go down. It’s not all about carrying arms and ammunition; the system can correct some ills “Any government that cannot protect its citizens is a failed government. The foundation is for us to organise ourselves, know how many we are and how track some basic indices. This is what some of us have been doing and preaching for a long time,” he said.
