The Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, has urged Nigerians to display virtues of love, tolerance and sacrifice in their daily activities. These, Dr. Fayemi said, are the hallmark of Easter celebration and catalyst for rapid socio-economic growth and development. The governor, in his Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, said Jesus exemplified the virtues of love, selflessness and tolerance during his earthy ministry. While congratulating Christians for the successful completion of the Lenten season, a period of 40 days of fasting and prayer which culminated in the Easter celebration, Fayemi said the Easter period offers Christians and the entire people of Ekiti State another opportunity for sober reflection, while celebrating with one another the joy of the season. “Our society requires more expression of love and peaceful lifestyle in order to improve the quality of life of the people”, Fayemi said.
