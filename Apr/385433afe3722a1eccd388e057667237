The Obstetrics and Gynaecology Centre of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, popularly called Ayinke House, has been upgraded from 80-bed to 170-bed capacity. It will be inaugurated soon to offer the best service to women, its Chief Medical Director (CMD) Prof Adetokunbo Fabamwo said at the weekend during a media tour of the facility. Fabamwo said the facility would satisfy the needs of women, children and newborn babies with its state-of-the-art equipment. “Women in Lagos and its environs are in for a very good time. We can only compare the facilities here with what you will find in developed countries,” he said. Fabamwo said the old Ayinke House was donated by the late Sir Mobolaji Bank Anthony and was an ultra-modern edifice “that served us for about 10 years. “The government felt it needed to be renovated. Now we have an ultra-modern hospital for women in Lagos and its environs.” The Head of Project Unit, Ministry of Health, Dr. Abiodun Adewole, said the government was committed to ensuring that the facility was functional. “The government approved intake of medical personnel across board even before the completion of the facility. What it has done is to address the lapses. This is a promise delivered.” The hospital and medical equipment consultant, Dr Sylvester Odigie, said it was originally a 80-bed capacity facility, noting that the government expanded it to 170. “This facility is equipped with 30 incubators; all with oxygen delivery system capability. There is a special space for challenged newborn babies requiring intensive care. The facility for intensive care has the capacity to deliver and support pre-organ treatment. It also has the capacity of 16 beds and a very high-dependency unit that incorporates a theatre to attend to emergencies,” he said. Works and Infrastructure Commissioner Ade Akinsanya said the facility would not be inaugurated until everything had been put in place to ensure its functionality.
