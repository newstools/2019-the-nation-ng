With the successful consummation of its merger with Diamond Bank, reports show Access Bank as the largest bank by size and top-line earnings, but the contest remains in the bottom-line. Analysts believe that value accretion from the merger may further catapult Access Bank in the leadership of the banking sector. Capital Market Editor, Taofik Salako, reports Nigerian banks generally maintained steady growth in the first quarter of the year, building on the performance of last year. Emerging results showed improved bottom-line; although banks appeared to be slow with the top-line in the first three months. The striking difference in the results is the emerging structural change in fundamental positions of banks. Access Bank, which during the quarter consummated a business combination with the defunct Diamond Bank Plc, is clearly now the largest bank in terms of assets and top-line earnings, leaping from  the third position by the end of last year. The three-month report for the period ended March 31, 2019 showed that Access Bank grew top-line earnings by 16.5 per cent to N160.12 billion in first quarter of the year, as against N137.54 billion in first quarter of last year. Profit before tax jumped by 66 per cent from N27.44 billion to N45.10 billion. After taxes, net profit leapt by 86.03 per cent from N22.12 billion in first quarter 2018 to N41.15 billion in first quarter 2019. Earnings per share also rose from 77 kobo to N1.39.  Fundamental shift From its third position last year, Access Bank’s total assets rose by 29.9 per cent from N4.95 trillion in December 2018 to N6.43 trillion in March 2019. Customer deposits leapt by 53.1 per cent from N2.56 trillion to N3.92 trillion, while shareholders’ funds increased by 17.8 per cent from N482.64 billion by December 31, 2018 to N568.74 billion by March 31, 2019. Most analysts believe that the first-quarter performance reflected both the immediate impact of the merger and the steady organic growth of Access Bank. First-quarter results showed that Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) Plc grew top-line earnings by 1.2 per cent to N110.33 billion in the first quarter of the year as against N108.97 billion in the first quarter of last year. Profit before tax rose by 8.3 per cent from N52.62 billion to N56.98 billion. Profit after tax also rose from N44.67 billion to N49.30 billion. With these, earnings per share increased from N1.58 in the first quarter of last year to N1.74 in the first quarter of this year. GTBank, Nigeria’s most capitalised financial institution, in terms of market valuation, closed first quarter 2019 with total assets of N3.56 trillion and shareholders’ funds of N627.2 billion. Customers’ deposits had risen by  six per cent to N2.41 trillion in March 2019 as against N2.27 trillion recorded by December 31, 2018 while loan and advances rose from N1.26 trillion in December 2018 to N1.28 trillion in March 2019. Last year, Access Bank had surpassed other competing leading banks, recording double-digit growths across key performance indicators. It rode on the back of improved operating efficiency and risk management to cross the N100 billion profit mark. The audited report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2018 showed that the bank grew pre- and post-tax profits by 32 per cent and 58 per cent. Gross earnings had risen by 15 per cent. Total assets increased by 21 per cent while customers’ deposit grew by 14 per cent. Group gross earnings rose to N528.7 billion in 2018 compared with N459.1billion in 2017. Interest and non-interest incomes contributed 72 per cent and 26 per cent to the top-line. Profit before tax rose from N78.2 billion to N103.2 billion while profit after tax increased to N95.0 billion in 2018 as against N60.1 billion in 2017. With these, earnings per share rose from N2.11 in 2017 to N3.31 in 2018. Return on average equity (ROAE) stood at 19.0 per cent while return on asset closed 2018 at 2.1 per cent. Access Bank’s total assets rose to N4.95 trillion in 2018 as against N4.10 trillion in 2017. Loans and advances had increased from N2.06 trillion to N2.14 trillion while customer’s deposits improved to N2.57 trillion from N2.25 trillion. Zenith Bank Plc recorded mixed performance in the first quarter with a decline in the top-line counterbalanced by improvement in the bottom-line. Gross earnings dropped from N169.19 billion in first quarter 2018 to N158.11 billion in first quarter 2019. Profit before tax meanwhile rose from N54.00 billion to N57.29 billion. Profit after tax also increased from N47.08 billion to N50.23 billion. Earnings per share thus rose from N1.50 in first quarter 2018 to N1.60 in first quarter 2019. Zenith Bank closed the period with total assets of N5.88 trillion and shareholders’ funds of N780.89 billion.  Growing value Market analysts believe that the merger may provide further impetus for growth for Access Bank, citing the bank’s pedigree of value accretion and seamless integration. Analysts at GTI Capital said the share price of Access Bank could rise by about 70 per cent over the next 12 months, a target premised on the first-quarter performance of the bank and the enlarged growth opportunity. “In light of the above and the favourable macroeconomic outlook for 2019, we anticipate a better dividend payout by Access Bank for the 2019 financial year. Hence, we maintained our price target of N11.30 for Access Bank,” GTI Capital stated in a first-quarter earnings review. The board of Access Bank has recommended payment of a final dividend per share of 25 kobo to shareholders, bringing the total dividend per share for the 2018 business year to 50 kobo. The bank had paid an interim dividend of 25 kobo per share. Under the terms of the merger with the defunct Diamond Bank, Access Bank took over all assets, liabilities and undertakings of the defunct bank, which was subsequently dissolved without being wound up. In exchange, Diamond Bank’s shareholders received a cash consideration of N1 per share and two ordinary shares of the enlarged Access Bank for every seven ordinary shares of Diamond Bank held as at the effective date. Directors and management of the banks have said the merger will create significant values for all stakeholders, underlining the inherent synergies and value accretion in the business combination. Group Managing Director, Access Bank Plc, Mr Herbert Wigwe said the enlarged Access Bank is well-positioned to beat the competition in the  banking industry and attain its goal of being the financial hub for Africa. He pointed out that increased earnings during the first quarter underscored the value potentials of the newly expanded business model. According to him, following the successful completion of the merger with Diamond Bank in March 2019, the bank has now fully positioned itself in the retail market to bring the power of banking to the doorsteps of millions. “We are providing a broader platform to facilitate payments services in Nigeria and across Africa, by harnessing our significantly enhanced digital technology capabilities,” Wigwe said. He noted that the capital and liquidity position of the bank remained above regulatory levels, with capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 19.5 per cent and liquidity ratio of 47.6 per cent, which further demonstrated the capacity of the enlarged balance sheet to cope with possible negative shocks. He pointed out that the bank has made solid progress throughout the first quarter of the year in line with its 2018-2022 five-year strategy, assuring that it remains committed to the achievement of its strategic imperatives going forward as it continues to invest in people, technology and most importantly, product offerings to customers. “Our focus is to become the world’s most respected African Bank by leveraging on the strength of our retail and wholesale business to provide unrivalled value to our customers,” Wigwe said. He noted that the enlarged bank will create significant opportunities and benefits to customers, shareholders, staff and other stakeholders, pointing out that similarity of several common values and technologies has made its business combination a seamless one. Against the background of the performance in 2018, Wigwe said the banking group has continued to make significant progress in spite of the challenges in the operating environment. According to him, the bank made solid progress throughout 2018 in line with its 2018-2022 five-year strategy, and it remains committed to the achievement of its strategic imperatives going forward. Looking forward, Wigwe assured that the banking group will continue to invest in its people and technology in order to improve operational efficiency and service touch points with earnings growth in 2019.  Ambitious plan Access Bank had in 2018 started implementation of a new five-year strategic plan aimed at making it Nigeria’s foremost bank by 2022. The new plan was expected to build on the successes of a series of transformative strategies that had resulted in sustained growth over the years. From 2013 to November 2017, Access Bank had increased its total assets at a cumulative yearly growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent and delivered shareholder returns of 90 per cent. The bank had also grown its customer base from 90,000 in 2002 to over eight million in 2017 and in the same period opened 351 new branches. Thus, the new five-year strategy was expected to accelerate this growth story to position Access Bank as the leading bank by 2022. The new strategy has many strategic levers including digitally led, retail banking growth and consolidation in wholesale markets, customer focused, analytics driven, with robust risk management, strong global collaboration in key gateway markets and the creation of a universal payments gateway. To deliver the transformation, Access Bank will adopt a new organisational structure. The retail bank will have a customer segment focus, driven by digital and payments. The corporate bank will build deep sector expertise and deploy global relationship managers. Also, Access Bank’s subsidiaries will be organised around strategic clusters, with strong collaboration between them to secure trade finance and correspondent banking. The bank’s transformation programme will be underpinned by robust risk management together with high levels of automation to enhance the compliance and risk functions and drive customer insights. In next phase of its transformation programme, Access Bank will also embark on a series of bold initiatives. At home, the goal is to be the ‘Number One Bank’ in Nigeria by growing the retail customer base, SME client base, and by dominating the top 100 Nigerian corporates. Internationally, Access Bank will develop an integrated global franchise by strategically developing its presence in key African markets, enhancing collaboration in global financial gateways, including London and New York, Asia and the Middle East, and strengthening its trade hubs in India, Dubai and China. A strengthened presence in key African markets, and the creation of universal payments gateway combined with an integrated global franchise, ideally positions Access Bank to be Africa’s gateway to the world. While the merger with defunct Diamond Bank took the financial services sector by storm, the success of the maiden N15 billion green bond by Access Bank has been lauded as one of the “bold initiatives”. The first corporate green bond to be issued in Africa to be fully certified to have met global climate bonds standard, the Five-Year Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured N15 billion Green Bond was awarded an Aa- rating by Agusto & Co, while the underlying framework was verified by PwC (UK) and the bond was certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative as having met the global climate bonds standard. The green bond was achieved by way of a book build which was fully subscribed. Access Bank would use the net proceeds from the green bond to foster its green bond framework, including support for projects directed at flood defense, solar generation facilities and agriculture. Deputy Chief Executive, Climate Bonds, Justine Leigh-Bell, said Access Bank’s Climate Bond-certified corporate green bond represented a major milestone in the development of the local green finance market. “In addition to being an inspiration to other private companies, the leadership demonstrated by Access Bank is critical for the long term development of the green finance market in Nigeria and a great example for other African nations to follow,” Leigh-Bell said. Wigwe noted that the green bond issuance highlights the bank’s commitment to sustainability and its status as a pioneer in green financing in both the domestic and international capital markets.
