The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) at about 11am today released a former 2nd Vice-President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Monday Ubani after 23 days in its custody. Ubani was arrested and detained on March 19, along with ex-Senator Christopher Enai for allegedly failing to produce a former Managing Director of Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, NSITF, Mrs. Ngozi Olejeme, who both men stood for as sureties. Olojeme is facing a N6.4billion fraud charge preferred against her by the EFCC. Ubani had maintained his innocence over Olejemeâ€™s disappearance insisting that she absconded after the EFCC raided her home He also stated that his decision to stand surety for Olejeme was because he compelled her to return to Nigeria to face the charge against her and all effort to secure her bail was frustrated by the EFCC.
