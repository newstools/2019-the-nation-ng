A Board of Trustees member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka has described as misnomer agitation for Biafra without correspondent development of other cities outside Igboland. He expressed dismay over Igbos continued establishment of factories in diaspora without recourse to investing in their homelands. Ezeonwuka who spoke to newsmen in Nnewi on Saturday, insisted that Igbos must embrace the think-home philosophy before the Biafra republic could be achieved. He said it would not be an overstatement to say that the Igbos were the most enterprising race in black Africa but have not been able to harness their potentialities to their best advantage. He said, “Nobody should give Ndigbo Biafra. We already have Biafra here with us and Biafra belongs to us as was declared on May 30, 1967. It is an act of stupidity to ask anybody to give you Biafra. “The land of Biafra is crying because our people in diaspora have abandoned it to develop other areas like Abuja, Lagos and other places and you are here telling them to give you Biafra.” Ezeonwuka, who is the propriator of Rogenny Games Village, Oba, insisted that things could be produced in Biafran land, labeled made in Biafra and exported to other countries of the world with general acceptability.
