The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) on Tuesday shut down five filling in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, stations for selling fuel above N145 per litre. The Head of Operations, DPR, Ibinabo Jack, led a team of the department to investigate the activities of the stations following warning issued to them independent marketers recently to stop selling the product above the regulated price. Some of the stations sealed were Sobaz, Emily and two NNPC stations located in different parts of the capital city. Ibanabo, said the operation was part of the duties of DPR to ensure that the public were not shortchanged by petroleum retail marketers. He said: “Actually we are out on a surveillance over the abrupt increase in pump price prevailing in the state. We visited some stations and anyone we saw selling above pump price we sealed such station with strident penalties. “Some that were sealed were actually meant to receive some numbers of trucks of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), but we discovered that those trucks loaded with PMS never arrived. “Some of them were under dispensing. An NNPC filling station was selling at NNPC price of N142 but we discovered that some of the pumps were faulty and we sealed them up.” Ibinabo urged the public to bear the temporary scarcity their action could cause to ensure permanent solutions to the problems. “People have to bear with us because we want to bring permanent solution to public suffering. The price of PMS has not changed at the depot and we won’t tolerate any increase in price”, he said.
