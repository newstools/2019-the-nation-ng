The National President of the All Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Kolade Alabi, has promised to restore the glory of the association. Alabi said this while receiving handover documents from his predecessor Gambo Tanko Kagara at the ALGON’s Abuja secretariat last Thursday. He becomes the first person in the Southwest to emerged National President in the 20 years of the association. According to him, when ALGON sneezes, the nation will catch a cold. “We will restore those good old days back,” he said. Alabi, who described the day as “significant” said that was the first time there would be a smooth transition of power from one regime to another in the last 20 years. He promised to hit the ground running, noting that ALGON would not only go to the next level but greater heights. He thanked the Odunayo Ategbero-led Board of Trustees (BoT) and National Executive Council (NEC) members for providing a conducive atmosphere for the smooth take over. “I will not take the confidence reposed in me for granted. We will all work together to reposition ALGON for better,” Alabi said. The former president, Kagara thanked God “for guiding us to a successful election.” He congratulated Alabi, urging to deliver his promises. He also hailed the BoT for a harmonious relationship during his tenure. “They (the BoT) do not interfere in my activities but advised where necessary. I will appreciate if such a gesture could be extended to my successor,” he said. ALGON Financial Secretary Frank Archibong urged Nigerians to emulate smooth transition from ALGON. “What has happened today is a good example for Nigerians to learn from. It is a clear indication that we can move the nation forward,” he said. Archibong assured Alabi of NEC members’ supports. “We do not doubt your capacity. As NEC members, we will do our best to move the association forward,” he said.
