Media Entrepreneur Mo Abudu has encouraged women to go for CoolSculpting instead of the regular exercises, which she says has not worked for her. Mo, who recently visited the Aspire Clinic, said a friend recommended the hospital during her last trip to London. She said: “It was lovely spending part of my day at @aspireclinicberks recently with Jenny, Christina and the rest of the team. One major topic we all love to talk about as women is weight loss and diet. “Well sharing is caring. A friend of mine during my last trip to London recommended the @aspireclinicberks for CoolSculpting. I had a crazy work schedule, but fitted it in! Yep all, I tried Coolsculpting on my tummy. It seemed no matter how many sit ups I did, my tummy area had a mind of its own. Cool sculpting is painless and non-evasive! But you need to wait three months to see the full effects! Will keep you posted on that.” Omotola Ekehinde, who replied to the post, added that it is the new procedure of losing tummy fat. “Yep. It’s the new non evasive rave,” she said. On the clinic official Instagram page, the media entrepreneur was recgonised. “It was wonderful to welcome the fabulous @moabudu to Aspire Clinic last week for her Coolsculpting treatment with our Clinic Director, Jenny O’Neill. Coolsculpting is ideal for those hard-to-shift pockets of fat, and as the world’s number one permanent non-surgical, fat-reduction treatment, there’s little to no downtime, so it’s ideal for anyone with a busy schedule! According to www.medicalnewstoday.com, coolsculpting or cryolipolyse is used for fat reduction. It is a branded, FDA-approved form of fat reduction called cryolipolysis. After the procedure, it may take around 4-6 months for the fat cells to leave the body. In that time, the area of fat will decrease by an average of 20 percent.
