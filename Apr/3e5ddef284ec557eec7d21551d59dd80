The Executive Director of Tesscom West Africa, Olukemi Ilori who made this known at a press conference said that it is a festival that celebrates Nigeriaâ€™s collective cultural identity as a nation in foods like jollof rice which has gained global acceptability. She noted that the festival gives us an opportunity to take our national food brand, Jollof Rice to other Rice festival and create awareness about Nigeria Jollof Rice, the best in the world as well as other Nigeria Rice dishes. Ilori stated that the festival is most importantly designed to enhance commercial activity in the entire rice value chain. It does so in such a way that people enjoy it and are happy, adding that we are fast tracking the development of the brand by hosting two festivals a year: one on the mainland and another on the island.
