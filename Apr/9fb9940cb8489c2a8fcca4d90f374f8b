A Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) official has been accused of physically assaulting three underage children taking shelter in a school at Oshodi, Lagos Mainland. The suspect, said to be on the run, allegedly assaulted the children aged eight, six and four at his father’s school at Oshodi, where the children had been sleeping since their parents abandoned them. The children have been rescued and taken to the government shelter by officials of the Ministry of Youth and Social Development. The incident, which was reported on a child’s advocate platform, caused outrage, with members demanding the arrest of the culprit. It was gathered that the children had suffered series of abuse from residents, who usually accused them of theft, until a neighbour reported the latest incident, following the injuries on them. The suspect, whose parents were said to have gone after the neighbour that reported the abuse, allegedly used a hot iron to inflict injury on one of the children’s buttocks. A member of the Child Protection Network (CPN), Mr. Wisdom Knight, said the school proprietor was invited by policemen at Akinpelu Division and asked to provide the suspect. He said the man’s wife allegedly threatened to send thugs after the neighbour who reported the incident, to kill her, making the woman to be afraid. “The suspect’s wife and her children later went to the home of the neighbour who reported the matter, threatening to kill her. “The woman escaped with her three children around 4am and ran to the local government secretariat where she works. “The case is being handled by Akinpelu Police Station. The suspect is yet to be arrested. “The family he lives with should be prosecuted if they fail to produce the suspect,” Knight said.
