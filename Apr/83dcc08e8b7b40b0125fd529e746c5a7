The police in Lagos have arrested two men, Friday Emmanuel, 21, and Obiora Nwabueze, 29, for allegedly stealing women’s panties. The suspects were nabbed by operatives of the Satellite Division on April 20, under the Mile Two Bridge, while fighting. It was learnt that a fight had broken out between the men after Nwabueze failed to pay Emmanuel N30,000 agreed upon for him to steal the panties. Police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said in a statement yesterday that when Emmanuel brought the panties, instead of paying him the agreed amount, Nwabueze attempted to snatch them and that caused a fight. “During interrogation, Emmanuel regretted listening to his friend, Nwabueze, who pestered him to get him women’s panties he desperately needed to become rich. “Both suspects were yesterday charged to Magistrates’ Court 23, Mbah Road, Ajegunle, Lagos, for conspiracy and stealing,” he said.
