Elected members of National Assembly from South East have been urged to support President Muhammadu Buhari and his party ideals to ensure the actualization of their political mandate to the people. Convener, All Progressives Congress (APC) South East Young Progressive Forum, Comrade Paschal Otimkpu, made the appeal in a congratulatory message made available to journalists in Awka Anambra State. He said there was no time for personal or self-serving agenda at the detriment of Ndigbo in particular and Nigerians at general. Otimkpu urged the lawmakers to be good ambassadors of Ndigbo with renewed resolve to attract more socio-economic development to the state and the region. He said, “All elected National Assembly Members from South East Zone are expected to align with pro-people agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari. “We urge them to hit the ground running by working closely with the federal government to identify ongoing federal government projects in order to fast track their completion as well as attracting other strategic projects. “The federal lawmakers must establish themselves in the National Assembly as loyal and sincere patriots and work, without compromise, for the overall development of the South East and the country at large.” The South East lawmakers were also enjoined to close ranks and establish synergy with the state governments in the zone in an attempt to forge a common front in bringing meaningful development to the region. They also urged the lawmakers to lobby, where necessary to attract more national presence in the region, assuring them of full support. The group maintained that Principal Officers in the National Assembly, especially the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives should be zoned to South East for equity, justice and fairness.
