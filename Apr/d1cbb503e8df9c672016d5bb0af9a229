Now in an intimate relationship, former Big Brother Naija housemate Teddy A praised girlfriend Bambam who turned 30, saying they have been through a lot together to become famous. The singer who described Bambam as a woman of many virtues, wrote on his Instagram page “Happy birthday to my queen, bestfriend, gossip partner, ride or die, business partner, personal adviser and cheerleader. “We’ve been through a lot together, lord knows we have. In this world of fame and wanting to build an empire you’ve always got my back just like I’ve got yours. You’re the definition of beauty, substance, class, subtlety, eloquence, intelligence, intellect and maturity. You saw right through me when no one else did and till this day you still do. “No matter how tough I act, you always have my mumu button lol. You were termed “fake” and I remember telling you the world would eventually adjust, they would realise you were raised differently. I could go on and on but I’m a whisper the rest in your cute lil ears! Today you turn 30, a significant number. May you continue to grow in wisdom, great health, prosperity and abundant blessings. Happy birthday Queen B!#WorldBammyDay Teddy A was reported to have revealed that he did not like BamBam at first saying she acts like a “church girl.” The singer made the disclosure during the Big Brother Naija Reunion show aired recently.
