The President of Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE), Mrs. Funke Egbemode, has called for synergy between the guild and the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). She insisted that such synergy would ensure better working conditions and welfare for journalists operating in Nigeria. Mrs. Egbemode, who is also the Managing Director of New Telegraph Newspapers, noted that increased working relationship between the NGE and NUJ would be of a great benefit to journalism as a profession. The NGE president said there should be fraternity between NGE and NUJ to enable both bodies gain mutual respect and redeem journalism’s image from ridicule and intimidation from external forces. According to her, the NGE administration has been advocating mutual understanding and operation between NGE and NUJ. She urged stakeholders of the two professional bodies to think towards this direction. Mrs Egbemode hailed the Kano State Council of the NUJ for conducting themselves “in a more mature and professional way”. She added: “The Kano NUJ has remained pace-setters across the country. I am glad with what you are doing. “The only place we saw this kind of maturity and excellent relationship between NGE and NUJ was in far-away China, not knowing it is highly workable in our own country.” The Kano State NUJ Chairman Abbas Ibrahim praised Mrs Egbemode for her giant strides in office. The chairman urged her not to relent in the efforts to re-brand journalism in Nigeria. He said: “Today in the world of journalism, Mrs Funke Egbemode is a success story and a source of inspiration. Her qualities should be imbibed for better journalism practice.” A former Director of Press in Kano State and senior journalist Sule Yau Sule said: “Today, what is actually missing is that sound relationship between working journalists on the ground and their editors. If that is achieved, the practice would tremendously improve for the better.”
