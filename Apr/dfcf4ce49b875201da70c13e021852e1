The Rotary Club of Lagos Mainland, District 9110 Nigeria, has rehabilitated 15 restrooms and a borehole at Iponri Grammar School, Ebute Metta, Lagos. Its President, Kazeem Bakare, said yesterday that the club’s gesture was at the  community’s instance. The toilets, comprising six each in the boys and girls sections,  one for the head teacher and two for staff members, were in a bad shape before the intervention, he said. Bakare said the club approved the project because it fell under one of its six core areas. The toilets, he said, were equipped with hand washing items to inculcate hygienic habits in pupils. “By refurbishing the toilets and digging a borehole for the school, we hope the pupils will take advantage and play their part in the maintenance of the facilities, so that they can stand a better chance for a lifetime of success,” he said. District Governor Kola Sodipo said: “We do this in order to enable teachers and pupils concentrate on what they are doing because when it is time to answer the call of nature and you don’t have a good toilet, you will be uncomfortable.” He urged the pupils to keep the toilets clean so that the club can be encouraged to accede to further requests. Head Teacher Akin Opawunmi said he would ensure that the restrooms were ‘’well maintained’’. A pupil, Iroko Abosede, thanked the club for its gesture, promising that the  school would use the restrooms properly.
