The Head of Arota/Ologun Family of Orile Oshodi in Oshodi Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State, Chief Teslim Adeola Almaroof, has hailed Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for transforming Oshodi. He said the transport interchange of the government inaugurated yesterday by President Muhammadu Buhari would accelerate development in the area and the state. Almaroof said Oshodi residents were excited about the project, which he noted would reduce gridlock. He described the transformation as the best and biggest transport interchange in Nigeria, adding that it would attract and boost business opportunities. Praising the innovation, Almaroof said the governor had carved a niche for himself by prioritising people’s welfare. He said travelling within and outside the state would be made easy with the availability of easy-access ticketing system, shopping malls and Internet facility. Almaroof said the aesthetic design of the parks had made Oshodi to become a place to behold – a tourist centre. He said the all-night security light mounted around the facility would help in averting theft by hoodlums. The terminals one and two, which are expected to be ready in less than three weeks, will take care of inter and intra city transport. The project is part of the bus reform initiative of the Ambode administration designed to bring sanity, transform Oshodi and enhance connectivity. There are over 30 parks at Oshodi, which are expected to be reduced to13, with modernised entry and exit points. Although, it is only the terminal three of the facility that will begin operation from May 2, as work is ongoing at the other two terminals, when completed, the interchange is expected to process about three million passengers per day.
