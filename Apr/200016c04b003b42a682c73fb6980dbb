Agege Local Government has empowered 40 indigent business owners and artisans with N100, 000 each. This brings the number of recipients of its monthly financial empowerment programme to over 300. The empowerment is an initiative of the Chairman, Mr. Ganiyu Egunjobi, aimed at supporting entrepreneurs and artisans. Speaking at the weekend during the presentation of the cash to the beneficiaries at the council secretariat, Egunjobi said Agege Local Government under his leadership prioritised petty businesses and was out to support the owners and ensure continuity of their businesses. He said the industry was critical to the economic growth of the area and the social well-being of residents, adding that the council would improve people’s well-being. “Since I took over office in July 2017, the council has made it a tradition to support selected indigent business operators every month. The beneficiaries are Agege residents from sectors of our economy, including market women and men and artisans. “The criteria to qualify for this monthly scheme are not rocket science. It is just to be a struggling business owner and resident of Agege.”
