The official report stated that the 30-year-old swore and shouted at referee Jesus Gil Manzano and also grabbed him “on numerous occasions” after he had been given his marching orders in the 28th minute. The ban, which ends Costa’s season as there are only seven games remaining, consists of four games for being found in breach of Article 94 of the league’s code of conduct for using insulting or offensive words towards a match official and another four matches for breaching Article 96, which refers to the use of light violence towards referees. Atletico were fined 2,800 euros (2,413.70 pounds), while Costa was fined 6,010 euros over the incident. They have 10 days within which they can lodge an appeal.
