Meanwhile, a tricycle operator, popularly called keke driver was allegedly stabbed to death at Saniz street Onitsha, the commercial city of the state. The deceased was reportedly killed by illegal revenue agents operating in the area following his delay in paying certain levies demanded from him. An eye witness, who simply identified himself as Obadiah, said trouble started when the deceased who had paid almost N2000 to the agents was asked to pay extra fees. “Even after parting with almost N2000, they still demanded another N1,700 which he appealed to them he will pay later,” he said. The witness however said the pleas fell on deaf ears as the agents stabbed him with bottle and abandoned him to bleed to death. The Nation learnt that the deceased was later taken to hospital by his colleagues where he was confirmed dead. Reacting, Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed said he needed to confirm the report from the DPO of the area before getting back to this  reporter.
