Nestle has sponsored the presentation of start-up grants to the beneficiaries of the 2019 edition of Youth Entrepreneurship and Empowerment Programme (YEEP). Put together by Activate Success International Foundation (ASIF), the beneficiaries of the programme were drawn from Kano, Benue, Kogi, Abuja, Niger, Delta and Plateau states respectively out of over 100 business proposals received from about 1000  youths who recently participated in the empowerment programme. TV Host and Founder of ASIF, Ms. Love Idoko said that YEEP was aimed at helping and encouraging young people to maximise their potentials. The beneficiaries, who were given their cheques at a brief event included those who were into fish farming, arts and craft, food processing, fashion, Information Technology and skin care products. She said: “The programme is held once every year; where youths register from all over Nigeria. We have people coming from all the states of the federation to attend this event and then we bring in young CEOs that have made remarkable achievements in different fields to speak to them and share their success stories.”
