Making staff part of decision-making process, teamwork and appreciation are some of the motivational indices that have kept Isolo General Hospital ahead of other general hospitals in service charter delivery in Lagos. This much was disclosed recently by its Medical Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Godwin Akhaboa during its Service Charter second quarter stakeholders meeting held at the hospital. According to Akhaboa, “We have made our staff part of the decision makers and you know you cannot fight a decision you are a part of. So we are a team that works together in word and action. We have also adopted this spirit of abundance, whereby accolades and appreciation go round. We also have non-monetary motivation, whereby we support staff for training, celebrate them during their birthdays and give them letters of appreciation. We also have outstanding staff of the quarter award, and this makes them want to do more.” Reeling out the hospital’s scorecard, Akhaboa said the hospital has attended to 750,997 patients and won several accolades including three Service Charter awards since he assumed its leadership in 2016, while stressing that the management and staff are committed to doing more. Akhaboa said the quarterly stakeholders meeting is designed to hear from patients/clients of the hospital, whom he described as ‘the critical stakeholders of the hospital,’ adding that since the introduction of Service Charter, “the hospital has been getting more of commendation than complaints.”.
