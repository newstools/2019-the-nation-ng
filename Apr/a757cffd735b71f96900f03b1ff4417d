There is pressure on Governor Godwin Obaseki to drop his Deputy, Hon. Philip Shaibu, as his running mate for next year’s governorship election. The pressure is said to be coming from some All Progressives Congress leaders in the Estako axis of Edo North senatorial district. Shaibu is regarded as a confident and ‘son’ of the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole but the leaders have asked for his removal as a condition for them to support Obaseki’s second term bid. It was gathered that the leaders have penciled down some names to be presented as Shaibu’s replacement with a view to whittle down his powers ahead of 2024 when the governorship seat will be zoned to other senatorial district. Those pressing for Shaibu’s removal, according to sources, are said to be from Auchi, Fugar, Okpella, Jattu, Owan East and Agenebode. An APC chieftain who spoke on anonymity said part of Shaibu’s sins were that he opted to support Obaseki‘s second term agenda and the role he played between silent wrangling between Uzairue and Auchi. A top government official however said Governor Obaseki would decide Shaibu’s fate in November when his administration clocked the third year. President of the Estako Solidarity Forum, Mr. Saidu Momoh, who confirmed the pressure to drop Shaibu said the group would wait for Obaseki to formally declare for second term before taking a stand.
