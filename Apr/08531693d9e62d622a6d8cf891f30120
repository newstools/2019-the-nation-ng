Having enjoyed an easy win in the first group match of the 2019 ITTF World Championships, it was a painful exit for Olufunke Oshonaike yesterday in the women’s singles after she narrowly lost to Estonia’s Airi Avameri in the deciding match of the group. Before the tie against the Estonian, Oshonaike was one win from making the main draw just like she did in 2017 in China, but a sheer ill-luck coupled with the disposition of her opponent, Oshonaike exited the tournament abruptly. A disappointed Oshonaike told NationSport: “I really wanted to win this match but it became difficult for me because my opponent was using long pimples. This really made it hard for me to predict what she will play. She is a good fighter as well because I thought that if I had won the second game, it would have been a different ball game entirely. The second game was very crucial unfortunately I lost. It is very painful for me losing this match because I prepared very well for this tournament.” She now shifted attention to the African Cup and African Games later in the year. “I think this is also a good preparation for me for the Africa Cup and African Games; I hope to continue my training and work more on myself before these important tournaments later in the year,” she added.
