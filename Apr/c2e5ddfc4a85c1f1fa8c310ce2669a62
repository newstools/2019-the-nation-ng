Federal College of Education (Technical), Omoku, Rivers State, has been thrown into mourning following the passing-on of a former Provost of the college, Prof Sir Addison Mark Wokocha. The late Wokocha, who held the Ikemba of Ogbaland title, was the third to administer the institution between 1998 and 2005. The deceased was honoured as a Fellow of the college in 2016 because of his good work while in the saddle. As a mark of honour, management had declared a three-day mourning with the college flag flown half-mast throughout the period. Similarly, a condolence register has been opened at the Administrative Block in honour of the deceased. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the college, Prince Charles Amadike-Otoboh, stated that the management of the institution led by its Provost, Dr. Emmanuel Ikenyiri, had earlier paid a condolence visit on the deceased family at his home town, Okposi near Omoku in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area. Speaking during the visit,  Ikenyiri described Wokocha’s demise as a big loss to the institution, noting that his achievements remain unmatched by any of his successors. He prayed the Almighty God to grant the soul of the former provost peaceful rest. Replying on behalf of Wokocha’s family, Chief Mark Wokocha praised the management for the prompt visit. He also thanked the management for the honour accorded the deceased.
