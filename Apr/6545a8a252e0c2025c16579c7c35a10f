Akeem “Dodo” Sadiku, the idol of Ibadan boxing fans, has declared his readiness to make his fans proud when he confronts the Republic of Benin’s Ekpresso Djamihou in an international light middleweight challenge bout on 21 April. The encounter is one of the eight bouts scheduled for GOtv Boxing Night 18, which holds at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Obafemi Awolowo (formerly Liberty) Stadium, Ibadan. Dodo, who won his last three fights via knockouts, vowed he would continue along the same line. “My fans know that I’m the knockout king. I will make them proud by knocking out Djamihou. I don’t see him going beyond three rounds. I’m fully prepared for this bout and he will see hell,” said Dodo. He added that his immediate ambition is to win the national title and believes that very soon, the ambition will be realised. Four other Ibadan-based boxers are slated to fight at the event. They include the highly rated Ridwan “Scorpion” Oyekola, who will take on Taofeek “Taozon” Bisuga in the national super featherweight title bout. The headline bout on the night is the African Boxing Union lightweight title clash between Nigeria’s Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph and Ghana’s Success “Brave Warrior” Tetteh, who has vowed to be the first boxer to defeat his Nigerian opponent. The event will also see Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde, West African Boxing Union welterweight champion, back in the ring.
