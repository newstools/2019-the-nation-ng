The Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) yesterday donated 32 neo-natal incubators to 13 government hospitals. It also donated six birthing suites to Lagos Island Maternity, Amuwo Maternal and Child Centre and Epe General Hospital. COWLSO Chairman and wife of Lagos State governor, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, accompanied by wife of the Governor-elect, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu,  spoke of the group ’s vision for expectant mothers to have access to world-class delivery facilities in public hospitals. According to her, an ideal childbirth will ensure the best outcome for mother and baby, in a safe environment that guaranteed quick recovery from the process, and allowed early and optimum bonding of mother and child. “My vision and that of COWLSO, is that in Lagos State, any expectant woman, regardless of origin, economic status and location, will have access to quality and safe child delivery experience that is in line with international best practice, in any of our public hospitals, at a minimal cost. “Child birth has always been one of the life-changing experiences that women go through. Different women go into labour having different emotions and expectations about the process and outcome. There is hardly a woman who had been in labour that would not remember that experience, many years after,” Mrs Ambode said. Birthing suites are stand-alone delivery units, where all three stages of a woman’s labour and delivery take place. They have private conveniences for patients and are fitted with automated birthing beds, ultra-modern vital sign monitors for mother and baby; specialised machines for monitoring the heartbeat of mother and baby and post- delivery care. The incubators will regulate the body temperature of pre-term babies and avail them the right environment to be nurtured, till they are fit to go home. The Medical Director of Lagos Island Maternity Hospital, Dr. Ademuyiwa Eniayewun, said  the committee’s gesture would help reduce infant and child mortality.
