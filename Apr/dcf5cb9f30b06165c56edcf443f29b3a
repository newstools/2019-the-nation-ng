Magistrate B.O. Osunsanmi ordered that Rasheed Kasali and Isiaka Adisa be remanded at Kirikiri Prisons. Osunsanmi ordered that the case file be sent to the DPP office. The defendants’ pleas were not taken. Kasali, 39, who lives at 18B, Dipo Olubi Street, Surulere, Lagos, and Adisa, 38, who resides at 11, Tosun Street, Itire-Ikate, Surulere, are facing a charge of rape .
