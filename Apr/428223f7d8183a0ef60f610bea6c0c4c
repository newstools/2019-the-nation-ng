As part of the preparations for the commencement of the Masters Degree Programme in Film Archiving by the National Film Institute (NFI), Jos, three staff of the NFI and a staff of the Department of Theatre & Film Arts of the University of Jos, have arrived the Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany, for a two months intensive under study. The programme is an educational collaboration between the Goethe University, Frankfurt; University of Jos and the National Film Institute, Jos. According to a statement signed by Head of Public & Intergovernmental Affairs of the Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC), Mr. Brian Etuk, the Masters Programme which is being funded by TNB-DAAD of Frankfurt for an initial period of four years to the tune of over 400,000 Euros, will run at the NFI from September 2019. The statement quotes NFC’s Managing Director, Dr. Chidia Maduekwe as saying that the Master Degree Programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria and indeed sub-Saharan Africa. The German government, Maduekwe said, should be commended for facilitating the programme at the Institute, as well as for other support and assistance to the Nigerian Film Corporation. He listed the restoration and full digitization of the film “Shaihu Umar” as well as the donation of a restoration and digitization scanner which has been deployed at the National Film Video & Sound Archive, Jos, as a pointer to the readiness of the NFI to commence the Masters Degree programme successfully. The programme is expected to enable Nigerian scholars, especially film professionals, to acquire the necessary skills and capacity to drive the nation’s quest to par with developed nations in archiving and film culture. The statement added that efforts are also being made to enable the NFI commence Post Graduate Diploma Programmes in Film, Television Studies and Film Engineering.
