ALTHOUGH presently keeping a low profile, cross-over actress Bukky Wright who recently celebrated her birthday, has decried people who choose to be ungrateful to God because of other challenges of life they may be facing, calling such people fools. “Appreciation is the cure for depreciation,” she said. “If you’re not Thankful, your tank can not be full; if you’re not Grateful, you are nothing but a great fool. Thank you Lord!. Holding a grudge might feel good in the moment. It might even make us feel powerful and vindicated, as if we are letting the person who hurt us know that we are holding them in prison until they recognize their wrong towards us. “In reality, all it does is create more pain and hurt inside of us. This has a severe impact on our physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional self. It is imperative that people understand that holding a grudge and allowing bitterness to take a deep root inside us is not a power position, but a position of bondage”. The multiple-brand ambassador is also the CEO of Wright Media & Associates.
