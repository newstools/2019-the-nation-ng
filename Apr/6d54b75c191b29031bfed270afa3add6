The Lagos State Task Force on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences has arrested two persons for alleged impersonation and extortion of money from a motorist. In a statement yesterday, the agency’s spokesman, Taofiq Adebayo, said  Ademola Oyegunwa, 40, and Olaogun Adamson, 48, were arrested at Ojota after they had negotiated and collected N15,000 from the motorist. Quoting his boss, Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), Adebayo said preliminary interrogations showed that the suspects presented themselves as task force officials and arrested the motorist for traffic obstruction. “They arrested the owner of the vehicle for obstruction at Ojota, drove him to Bolade bus stop, opposite the task force office, where they negotiated and collected the N15,000 from him. “We have received complaints from motorists, particularly commercial bus drivers, about the activities of these unscrupulous fraudsters who specialise in impersonating officers of the agency and defrauding people. “The chairman reiterated that police officers attached to the Lagos State Task Force enforcing traffic and environmental sanitation laws wear jackets with the inscription,  ‘LASG TASK FORCE’, for proper identification while on duty. “Only Lagos State Task Force and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) are empowered by law to enforce traffic laws on ‘BRT’ corridors across the state’’. The suspects will soon be charged to court.
