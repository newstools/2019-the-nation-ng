 Super Eagles Ahmed Musa and his Al-Nassr teammates will be hoping to pick vital points when they face Al Zawra’a in the Asian Champions league on Monday. Al-Nassr occupy the last place in Group A with no points in the two matches played so far. There Monday opponents Al Zawra’a lead the group with four points followed by Zob Ahan in the second position with same four points but inferior goal difference to Al Zawra’a. Although Al-Nassr appear to be on the disadvantage going into Monday clash they nonetheless hope that a good outing could narrow the gap and perhaps turn the table especially if Zob Ahan who are facing third placed Al Wasl away falter in that encounter. Musa who has made over nine appearances for the Saudi Arabian side scoring five goals in the bargain look good to net more goals for the side. The former CSKA ace that only few days back emerged Player of the year in the AlteoNFF award remains quite formidable and has within a short time endeared himself to the hearts of Al-Nassr fans. Musa who joined the side shortly after the World Cup in Russia for a reported fee of £14.5 million over N6.7billion has contributed in no small measure to boosting the fan base of the club. Musa is one of the players Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr is banking on to help him deliver in this year’s nations cup billed for Egypt. The German tactician is in a hurry to lay hands on a trophy after taking charge of Super Eagles since 2016. After qualifying for the Nations cup that will for the first time feature 24 teams, Rohr has moved to the next stage that of praying to have favorable draw to start with. “We have achieved one of our dreams which is to qualify for the Nations cup which we have achieved the next thing is to prepare well and be ready to compete with the bests since there are no pushovers anymore,” he said
