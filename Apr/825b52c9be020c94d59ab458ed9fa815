Nordic governments have become the first in the world to call for a global treaty to tackle the plastic crisis in our oceans. The landmark declaration was made at a gathering of the environment ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden at the Nordic Council in Reykjavik. The announcement comes after world leaders failed to agree to meaningful policy decisions on the issue at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi last month. “This milestone declaration by Nordic governments should serve as inspiration for others. Plastic pollution in our oceans is a crisis that requires concerted action from world governments – a global treaty is the only viable way to address the eight million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans every year,” said Director- General of World Wild Fund International (WWF), Marco Lambertini. WWF is an international non- governmental organisation founded in 1961 in Switzerland. Its mission is to stop the degradation of our planet’s natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature calling for a binding treaty that would establish national targets and transparent reporting mechanisms that extend to companies. In addition, any treaty should provide for financial and technical support for low income countries to scale up their waste management capacity. Having invested well over US$1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1985 alone, WWF is working to bring a balance between our demands on our world, and the variety of life that lives alongside us.
