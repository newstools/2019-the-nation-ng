A Non-Governmental Organisation, Centre for the Advancement and Protection of The Rights Of Vulnerable People (CAPRIGHTS-VP), has unveiled two manuals on sexual violence and juvenile delinquency for schools in Alimosho Local Government Area, Lagos. It said the manuals will support teachers, counsellors and parents in the treatment of vulnerable issues and ensure they remain effective and efficient support base for pupils. The unveiling coincided with the closing of Voices of Freedom project by CAPRIGHTS-VP, and handing over of the project to the participating schools. Programme manager for CAPRIGHT Clara Kanu urged the pupils to speak against sexual abuse, bullying within or outside the school. She urged school authorities to support the pupils in making their voices heard. Kanu also implored the Lagos State Education Board to facilitate the adoption of Voices of Freedom platform in other schools and ensure that copies of the guidelines are handed over to them. She said: “Our original plan was to pilot this project within government secondary schools but this is an opportunity to relaunch the partnership opportunity with government schools. “With the commitment of the Education Board, CAPRIGHT team will be standing by to provide the necessary support that will ensure that the brilliant impact of this project is not limited only to schools in Alimosho. “I, therefore, challenge the schools, especially the pupils, to keep the light shining, let the platform become more formidable than it is today and a force to reckon with both within and outside Alimosho Local Government Area.”
