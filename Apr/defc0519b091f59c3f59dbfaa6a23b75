Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Task Force) Unit and the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) have dislodged those trading on road setbacks and walkways in Ikeja. They gave food vendors  blocking a portion of Awolowo Road, opposite Airport Hotel, Ikeja, 72 hours to quit so as to allow  residents unfettered  access to their homes at night. In a statement yesterday,   task force Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, said the illegal traders, hawkers and other environmental nuisances were  impeding free flow of traffic around Kodesho Street, Medical Road and Ikeja Under Bridge towards the railway line. The statement said Section 1 of the Lagos State Street Trading and Illegal Market Prohibition Law 2003 prescribed N90, 000 fine or six-month jail term for  buyers and sellers of goods on all roads across the state. “Despite continuous advocacy, enlightenment and appeals from the government, some illegal traders and hawkers are still in the habit of violating the extant environmental laws of the state by causing disorder and serious environmental infraction on the roads through their activities”, it said. It warned “all illegal traders and hawkers to vacate the roads in order to drastically reduce inconveniences to motorists, enhance the sustainability of the environment and protect public infrastructure, which are often vandalised by hawkers and street traders.” Seven persons were arrested, while goods including fairly-used clothes (okrika),  shoes, belts, electronics, gas cylinders and phone accessories were seized during the exercise. Commissioner of Police Zubairu Muazu has directed that they be prosecuted.
