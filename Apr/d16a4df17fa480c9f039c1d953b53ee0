The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN) has distanced himself from claim by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) that he was working with Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi to void the result of the last governorship election in Rivers State. Malami’s spokesman, Salihu Isah, described the claim by the PDD as ridiculous and demanded that the AGF should not be linked with the local politics in Rivers State. Isah, while speaking with The Nation on Sunday, said: “I am not aware of any such ridiculous plan. There is nothing like that, to my knowledge. “We are in a democracy, and there are institutions with powers to void elections if the need arises. That is not part of the responsibilities of the Attorney General of the Federation. “So, they should not link him (the AGF) with such ridiculous claim. They should leave the AGF out of the local politics in Rivers State.   “There are better and more important issues to attract the attention of the minister,” Isah said.
