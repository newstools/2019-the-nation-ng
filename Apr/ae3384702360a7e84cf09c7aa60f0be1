To curb what is commonly tagged “crazy bills”, some Lagos lawyers have urged the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to map out pricing guidelines for consumers’ benefit. The lawyers, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), described as “outrageous” the monthly bills sent by electricity distribution companies, and classified same as a crime against the public. They called for the adoption of an urgent measure to serve as a control on the pricing system in electricity distribution. Mrs. Vivian Ekwegh, from the law firm of Chief Benson Ndakara and Co, said ‘Crazy bill’ was exploitative and a crime against the masses. Exemplifying herself as a victim of excessive billing, she said: “Estimated billing is a crime against the masses because this is just one out of many ways in which the masses are being exploited. “I am a victim of estimated billing, and despite erratic power supply, each month I am sent a ‘crazy bill’ to pay up or risk disconnection,” she said Ekwegh said efforts to go through channels to redress the situation and obtain a prepaid meter had failed, as the bills kept coming in monthly. “Despite going through the appropriate channels to get a prepaid meter, which, in my opinion, is a proper pricing system to determine how much I really owe, it has proved abortive. “This raises my suspicion that indeed, estimated billing may be intentional; it is a racketeering against the public,” she said, and called for proactive measures on the way forward. “The solution is for the NERC to live up to its responsibility of protecting consumers by ensuring that every household is given a prepaid meter. “If this is done, it will foster a proper pricing system and better estimation of how much electricity consumers utilise,” Ekwegh said.
