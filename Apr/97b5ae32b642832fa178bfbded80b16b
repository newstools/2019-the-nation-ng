 Ahead of their semifinal clash against Guinea U17 Wednesday, Eaglets coach Manu Garba has told his boys to forget past victories and treat the clash as final showdown. While admitting that the achievements made so far at the on going championship in Tanzania is heartwarming, the party according to the former Flying Eagles coach must be put on hold to fight all the way to the final. “We topped the group and we didn’t lose any match that is good, but we must put all that aside and give full concentration to the semifinal clash like I said will be very tactical, “he said Guinea finished as runners up in Group B with six points in three games to set up semifinal clash against Nigeria. Garba who won the FIFA U-17 world cup in 2013 and the 2015 Africa U-20 championship in 2015, is hoping to add the U-17 Nations cup title to his resume. Nigeria last won the championship in 2007 in Togo, finished as runners up in 2013 in Morocco, and in the 4th place in the 2015 edition in Niamey. In comparison Guinea’s highest level in the championship has been the third place finish. Interestingly the West African country have finished in the third place three times 1995,2015 and 2017 and will no doubt be dreaming to go beyond that in  Dar es Salaam.
