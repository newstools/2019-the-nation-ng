The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has condemned the molestation of a four-year-old pupil of the University of Lagos Women Society (ULWS) Nursery and Primary School by a driver. In a statement by the institution’s Principal Assistant Registrar, Communication Unit, Mrs Taiwo Oloyede, the university management promised to see the case to a logical conclusion. The statement follows allegations that the school was trying to cover up the  case and beg for leniency from the child’s parent, which has been denied by the school. The university has assured that the case would be thoroughly investigated with transparency and justice would be served. The statement reads: “The attention of the University of Lagos Management has been drawn to the case of the alleged molestation of a four-year-old pupil of the University of Lagos Women Society (ULWS) Nursery and Primary School, Akoka, Lagos by a driver. “We wish to reassure all our stakeholders, parents, members of staff and the general public that the Management of ULWS Nursery and Primary School and the University will not treat this matter with levity.”
