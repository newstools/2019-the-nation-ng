The Kogi State House of Assembly has recommended the removal of the Chief Judge (CJ) of state, Justice Nasir Ajanah, for alleged gross misconduct. This followed Tuesday’s adoption of the report and recommendations of the House committee on public account, which indicted the Kogi State High Court and Kogi Hajj Commission of financial breaches. The House said that the Chief Judge could step aside to defend himself over the indictment by the auditor general of the state. The House also recommended punitive measures on those indicated, to “avoid a reoccurrence.” It however directed the state government to urgently resume payment of salaries of judicial workers. Committee Report 30 of the House Committee on Public Accounts on the State’s Auditor General’s on the 2016 Financial Statements (Budget Performance Analysis on Personnel Cost, Overheads, Capital Expenditure and Revenue Performance of Kogi State for the Year Ended 31st December, 2016), was presented by Hon. Ahmed Mohammed, Committee Chairman. It would be recalled that Kogi judicial staff members have been on strike for close to six months over unresolved differences between the judicial arm and executive, arising from their alleged non submission to the staff payroll verification exercise embarked on by government late last year. The judicial arm had earlier alleged of plans by Governor Yahaya Bello to remove Ajanah from office. Kogi Speaker Prince Mathew Kolawole had however denied knowledge of such plan.
