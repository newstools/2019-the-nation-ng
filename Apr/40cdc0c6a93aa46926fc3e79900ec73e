Borussia Dortmund eased past Freiburg 4-0 on Sunday with goals from Jadon Sancho, Marco Reus, Mario Gotze and Paco Alcacer, to stay a point behind leaders Bayern Munich with four games left in the Bundesliga season. England international Sancho tapped in from close range for the visitors in the 12th minute and Reus completed another fine move in the 54th to score his 16th goal of the season. The pair then combined to set up Gotze for their third in the 79th and Dortmundâ€™s top scorer Alcacer made it 4-0 with an 87th minute penalty, his 17th league goal. The result kept Dortmund, on 69 points, within striking distance of Bayern, who are top on 70 after their 1-0 victory over Werder Bremen on Saturday. RB Leipzig are in third place on 61, nine points clear of fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt.
