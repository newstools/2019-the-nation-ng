FC Midtjylland of Denmark striker, Paul Ebere Onuachu has been tipped to leave the Scandinavian outfit this summer for a princely sum that could be way above €10m and FC Porto of Portugal are already in the forefront for his signature. Reports out of Denmark indicate that Midtjylland are not keen on letting Onuachu go, but Porto are putting pressure on the Herning-based side for the lanky attacker’s signature, after he scored in his second match for the Nigerian national team. Onuachu’s goal in the 1-0 win against Egypt made marks as the second fastest ever in international football, second fastest all-time on African soil, and helped Nigeria beat The Pharaohs for the first time in 19 years, thereby setting the lad up for rave reviews. Expectations are now high that he will be part of Nigeria’s squad to this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, which could further shore up his value, yet Midtjylland are playing hard to get in the summer window. With 19 goals and six assists to his name so far, Onuachu has caught the eye of several clubs across Central Europe, but Porto are said to be in the forefront for his signature, and the former UCL champions are expected to formally open talks for his transfer at the end of the Danish season. Porto are in a rush to get the deal sorted out, considering Ounucha’s soaring image, and the Portuguese side want to conclude a switch for him before the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in June. Midtjylland initially placed €10m on Onuachu, who has been with them since 2013 and has two years left on his contract, until the summer of 2020, following his contract extension in 2016. Speculation, though, is now rising high that Midtjylland are considering upping their asking price on the lanky lad, who first made headlines when he scored against Manchester United in the Europa League three years ago, as his club bosses believe his value has shot much higher.
