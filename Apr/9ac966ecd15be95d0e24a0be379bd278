AHEAD of the emergence of its leadership and  commencement of the Sokoto State 9th Assembly, serving and members-elect on the platform of the All Progressives Congress(APC) have vowed to resist any attempt to alter the existing provisions of the House standing  orders, stressing that all lawful measures would be taken to abort it. The lawmakers who are 21 in number, observed that the eleventh hour orchestrated attempt, is aimed at manipulating the orders to favour certain egocentric interests of some political zealots. “We the Serving and Members-elect on the platform of APC categorically disassociate ourselves, our party and all our political associates from the heinous and hasty move.” Addressing a press conference Thursday in Sokoto, Hon. Abdullahi Garba who led the lawmakers said they unanimously and vehemently reject the obnoxious plan by the outgoing 8th Assembly to amend the existing House standing orders. Garba who described the  alleged attempt as alarming also noted that the outgoing 8th Assembly had commenced the all important process belatedly at a time its being wound up. “The House standing orders are the guiding rules for the general operations of Honourable House as well as the conduct of the Honorable members at the plenary. The orders also guide the process of the election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker respectively. The exercise should not have been embarked upon when it has only few weeks to cease to exist,” the serving lawmaker pointed out.
