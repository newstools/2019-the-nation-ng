ORO Descendants Union (ODU), Oloro of Oro Kingdom Oba Abdurafiu Ajiboye Oyelaran and the Oloro-in-Council in Irepodun local Government Area of Kwara State yesterday sued for peace among members of the ancient community. The community was reacting to a media publication by some people, who allegedly distorted the history of the ancient town pertaining to a recent judgment by the Supreme Court. Other towns that make up the kingdom include Ijomu Oro, Iludun Oro, Okeola Oro, Agbeola Oro, Iddo Oro, Affin Oro, Irebode Oro, Okerimi Oro, Sie Oro and Olorunsogo Oro. Addressing reporters in Ilorin, the state capital, ODU National President Uthman Balogun urged the people of the community “to be patient and refuse to be provoked by this publication or any others that any misguided or evil-minded people may publish”. The Oloro of Oro insisted that every citizen of the kingdom should be calm despite any provocation. “Contrary to the publication, Oro Kingdom existed from time immemorial and that the kingdom has always been under the paramountcy of the Oloro. It is a kingdom recognised by our custom and tradition. No amount of falsehood or malicious and irresponsible publications can change the truth of the history and custom of Oro Kingdom – the menace of a separatist few notwithstanding. “The said publication, in its design and timing, amounts to a deliberate act of provocation capable of triggering public disturbances, among other criminal offences. We are sure the relevant authorities will look into this. “The Supreme Court judgment of January 18, 2019 referred to in the publication never pronounced on the name Otun-Oro or Oro as mischievously and maliciously said. Only unrepentant liars will quote the highest court of the land wrongly,” the monarch said.
