Prince Owumi further said that the club made the initial N200,000 deposit for his admission and commencement of treatment at the private health facility. “Christian Chukwu is a legend and our governor holds him in high esteem and takes whatever concerns him with high regard. “So, it beats me hollow for some media channels to start peddling stories that he was abandoned. It is not true. “Our legend, Chukwu has been assessed by medical personnel at the hospital and is gradually getting over the health challenge. “We did not want to make the efforts of Enugu state government and Rangers, in this case, public, because his family never wanted his condition a public affair,”he said.
