A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Women Arise for Change Initiative, has suggested that gun-carrying police officers be subjected to psychiatric test, “to save Nigerians from their unusual brutality.” Its President, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, who spoke yesterday in Badagry, Lagos, when she received the Female Activist of the Year award from the Society for Human Advancement and Creativity Organisation (SHACO), an NGO, said the police were supposed to be life savers, “but the recent killing of innocent people is very sad and disturbing.” She said: “The brutality being perpetrated by those who bear firearms has resulted in one death too many and I think that was what I said two years ago when we engaged the Federal Special Anti-Crime Squad in their training on human rights. “I said those who bear arms must be subjected to psychiatric test. “There is also the need, from time to time, for a test to be conducted (on them) in terms of alcohol (intake). “The way police officers who carry arms drink alcohol has resulted in the killing of innocent citizens. “I want to say that anyone who carries out this dastardly act must be brought to book. “Besides dismissal, the (guilty officer) should be tried in a court.” Okei-Odumakin hailed Acting Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu and Lagos Police Commissioner Zubairu Mu’azu for their efforts at ensuring ‘’policing with integrity’’. “They should let those who bear arms know that no one is above the law. “For those who are victims of police brutality, we stand with them and pray to God to uphold their families. “But for those who are dead, I cannot bid them farewell until justice is served. That justice must be served until we bid them farewell,” she said. SHACO founder Mark Akande said Okei-Odumakin was honoured  because of her role in the Walk for Light protest last year.
