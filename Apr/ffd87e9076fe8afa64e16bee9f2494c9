The Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) has appointed Muhammad Mainoma as its 11th National President. Speaking during his investiture in Abuja, the new ANAN leader,  commended the founding fathers, past presidents, fellows and members of the association for their commitment and resilience in building a strong Professional Accounting  Organisation (PAO) in the country. “Under my leadership, as the 11th President and Chairman of Council, the association shall focus on networking globally, technical support, innovation and consolidation, new knowledge and technology and global brand building,” he said adding that greater collaboration is required among professional accounting organisations in Nigeria on national issues. “The council shall be working with other PAOs to form a joint accounting body as formidable platform for advancing government. The Federal Government’s National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS) needs the support of PAOs in Nigeria. PAOs must work alongside government, regulators, law enforcement and international bodies to combat corruption, tax evasion, money laundering and to strengthen transparency and accountability programmes,’’ Mainoma said. On the economy, he said the macroeconomic performance of the Nigerian economy had largely reflected the role of the global economy.
