 Super Eagles forward Henry Onyekwuru was in a refreshing mood after scoring against compatriot Victor Moses’s Fenerbahce in the Turkish league last Sunday, but regretted that the game ended in a 1-1 draw. Onyekwuru who found the net in the 66th minute of the match that produced a lot of caution from Centre referee Ali Palabıyık said it was one match they had vowed to win with intent to claiming the maximum three points at stake. Both Onyekwuru and Victor Moses played for full 90 minutes with Moses only replaced in the two minutes of added time by home boy Alper Potuk. Onyekwuru’s goal was cancelled out five minutes later by Eljif Elmas to pull Fenerbahce level as the two teams ultimately settled for a point apiece. The result leaves Galatasaray five points behind log leaders Istanbul Basaksehir who are closing in on a first Turkish Super Lig title even as they get set to host 11th placed Kayserispor on Saturday “When you play against your rival, it is a very important and nice feeling for a footballer to score in such a match. I’m happy to have this feeling, but it was a game we wanted to win,” Onyekuru told Galatasaray’s official website. “The score did not satisfy us. After this time, we have nothing to do. We have to put this match aside and prepare for each match separately. “You know anything can happen in football. There is five-point difference but every moment can be everything. We need to fix our mistakes, we need to work harder and continue without error. As I have just said, anything can happen at any moment,” he concluded. Unfortunately both Onyekwuru and Victor Moses had their own share of the yellow cards in the match that produced nine yellow cards and a red. The two Nigerians may be missing in their club’s next match against Kayserispor and Alanyaspor respectively. Onyekwuru who stands a good chance of making Super Eagles squad to the Nations cup in Egypt due for submission June 10, has so far netted 12 goals for Gala this season.
