A ROAD crash yesterday claimed the lives of seven persons in Oke-Oyi, Ilorin East local government area of Kwara State. It was gathered that the dead include three men and four women. The injured were 34 women and 24 men. Also injured were 12 children, comprising six boys and six girls. The ghastly motor accident was said to have happened at about 9:40am at Osi Bridge, Apado area on old Ilorin-Jebba-Mokwa road. Kwara State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Uchechukwu Wihioka confirmed the incident. He said the auto crash involved a Toyota Dyna with plate number FA 655 NAS and Toyota Hiace with plate number LSD 919 SR. Wihioka attributed the cause of the crash to dangerous driving and wrong overtaking. The FRSC boss said the Dyna truck driver could no longer control the vehicle after finding himself in the dangerous condition. “The driver flung his passengers in different directions on the road,” Wihioka said. He said a combined team of FRSC officials and men of the police came to the scene on time to render necessary assistance. Wihioka cautioned commercial drivers and other road users to always drive with caution. The sector commander also urged passengers to drive along with commercial drivers, so that they could caution them when driving recklessly. Wihioka added that passengers have the right to do that, adding that lives would be saved when everyone is involved in road safety.
