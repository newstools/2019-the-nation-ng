The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State has kicked against a bill passed by the state’s House of Assembly awarding life pensions to its members. The party said it also observed how the strange idea, which was proposed as a bill and passed by the House on Wednesday, had set the public pulse racing. The party said completely rejected the idea describing the bill as unjust, ungodly and self-serving. The State Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr. Doifie Buokoribo, said it was unsympathetic for members of the House of Assembly to seek to enhance their own lives at the expense of the vast majority of Bayelsa people living in pain and penury. Buokoribo described the life pension bill as an unspeakable crime against our people. He said the party was making efforts to enthrone a regime of better life for the people of Bayelsa. Buokoribo said: “And we have led a robust opposition to the current system of anti-people governance in the state for close to eight years. “Regarding this latest move by the House of Assembly, we again say that the idea is avaricious, wicked, and insensitive. By proposing such a law, the lawmakers have merely portrayed themselves as a people who feel no concern for the feelings of their suffering constituents. “They have once again confirmed that they are in cahoots with the executive in the serial impoverishment of the people of Bayelsa State. “APC advises the legislature to withdraw the obnoxious pension bill and avoid the appalling crime against the people of Bayelsa State. “In the event of the legislature’s refusal to heed this solemn advice, we appeal to Governor Henry Seriake Dickson, if he is still in touch with his essential humanity, to refuse assent to the pension bill when it is transmitted to him. “Failing this, the party calls on the people of Bayelsa State to embark on a campaign of peaceful resistance against the rogue assembly and the poverty regime of Governor Dickson.”
