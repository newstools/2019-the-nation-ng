Paris Saint Germain have retained the Ligue I title following second-placed Lille scoreless draw with Toulouse. The draw means Lille sit 16-points behind PSG, making it mathematically impossible to upstage the leaders with six games to go. It is the sixth consecutive title for PSG who now boast of eighth titles overall. The Thomas Tuchel-coached side welcome Brazilian super star Neymar back in the game against Monaco later today.
