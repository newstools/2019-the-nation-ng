Odi Community in Kolokuma-Opokuma Local Government Area, Bayelsa State, has cried out to President Muhammadu Buhari following recurrence of a natural disaster in the area caused by river surge. The River Nun surrounding the community is threatening to wipe out Odi as it constantly overflows its banks destroying houses, roads and other facilities. Recently, the surge pulled down four houses and ravaged a large portion of the major road in a major disaster that unsettled the community. But the Secretary of Odi Chief Council, Chief Throughman Abiama, said the old solution to the ecological disaster is a shoreline protection. Abiama said a proposal for the community’s shoreline protection contract was before the Federal Executive Council and appealed to the Federal Government to approve it. He further pleaded to the Niger Delta Ministry to quickly intervene and save Odi community from extinction. Also speaking, the Chairman, Odi Community Development Committee (CDC), Mr. Goddy Niweigha, said the community was informed that the shoreline project was captured in the 2018 Budget of the Federal Government through the efforts of its kinsman and stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Preye Aganaba. Specifically, he said the project was published in major national dailies through the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. He said: “We are calling on President Buhari and the Niger Delta Ministry, to ome to our aid and ensure that the approval process is fast-tracked.Time is of the essence,as you can see, Odi community is on the verge of being washed away into the River Nun.”
