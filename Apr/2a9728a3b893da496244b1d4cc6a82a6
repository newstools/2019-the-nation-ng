Nigeria is still in races to add to his medals’ haul at the ITTF Africa Junior and Cadet Championship as the West African giant battles the North Africans – Egypt and Tunisia in the singles events. Already with three gold medals in the team events were in the kitty for Nigeria and today which is the final day of the tournament, it promises to be exciting as battle for the podium gets hotter. It is Day 7 of the ITTF African Junior and Cadet Championships here in Accra, Ghana; the final day of the competition. And what a swell time we – the 21 participating teams, the fans, officials and the media – have all had in the hospitable ambience of the former Gold Coast! As the table tennis fiesta hits peak point today, more fireworks are in the offing as new singles champions are crowned. It has been a week of exhilarating play by the African continent’s young and upcoming stars in the game cutting across the cadet, junior and U-21 categories. The competition has been top-notch with the players displaying exceptional skills on the table to the admiration of the fans at the Sports Trust Emporium here in Accra. Out of the 21 teams which started the journey on Sunday April 7, four are still in the race for the titles in the last six events. President, African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF), Khaled El-Salhy, lauded the players for putting up a good show in the championships while hoping that the two teams that qualified for the World Junior Championships (WJC) in Thailand would prepare very well and make the continent proud. “I am so happy with the way the players and teams conducted themselves in the tournament. I must also commend the organisers and host, Ghana Table Tennis Association (GTTA), for their hospitality and warm reception. We hope and believe the performance in Ghana will surely be replicated in Thailand,” the ATTF chief said.
