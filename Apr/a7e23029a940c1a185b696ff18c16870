The Executive Chairman of Yaba Local Council Development Authority (LCDA), Kayode Omiyale, has told the people that PSPs have been re- introduced to cart away our refuse rather than the Visionscape policy. Omiyale, who spoke at a stakeholders’ consultative meeting to involve the residents in the policy shift, said: “The only permanent thing in life is change. Hence, Visionscape that was introduced to replace the PSP seemed not to meet the yearnings of the people of Lagos State. Let me use this opportunity to appreciate the Market leaders, Community Development Associations and stakeholders. “The rainy season is here, let us be up and doing, let the drains flow unhindered in order to avoid flooding. Our environment is a product of our actions, if we are clement to our environment, the environment will be favourable to us.” Omiyale thanked members of the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI), led by the HOD CLI, Olawale Abdullahi, the Yaba Environmental Sanitation  Corps’ Gbadebo Akerele, Alade Grillo and other notable APC leaders.
