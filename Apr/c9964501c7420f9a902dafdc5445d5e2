An expert in real estate management, Dr Jerry Nwakobi, has urged the Federal Government to begin to probe the incidence of collapsed buildings nationwide, noting that corruption was at the heart of such defects. Nwakobi said the government must set up a committee to investigate the collapses and such committees must also be monitored in order not to compromise their findings. He stated this in a statement, after being honoured with a honorary doctorate degree by the European-American University Commonwealth of Dominica, African Regional Operations. He said, “There are deep concerns over the cankerworm called corruption that has eaten deep into the Nigerian system. Our industries don’t operate in an environment conducive to growth. “Also, the government is supposed to provide access roads and stable electricity to estates while the estate management makes provision for other facilities. But today, everything has changed and the estates shoulder every responsibility. “The recently collapsed buildings in Lagos State for example could be due to corruption. “The government should set up a committee to investigate the collapsed buildings and there should be monitoring of the activities of the committee. “This is so that they will not get to the field and collect bribes. When the job is not appropriately done, somebody should be penalised. So, there is need to investigate the investigators.”
