NOLLYWOOD Actor, Adeniyi Johnson has used his marriage experience to motivate the attendees of black tie event which held recently. Johnson took to his Instagram page to post a picture with a caption: “He has a broken marriage, he couldn’t manage a home, second marriage before 40th–Yes, I concur but do you know God use foolish things of this life to confirm the wise…lots of inventor and great men of this world at some point in life had set backs…what I went through might happened so you can learn or be motivated… You are free to pass judgement if only your journey has been smooth of went as planned… As ugly as a mango tree looks, we all benefit and love the fruit…That’s me standing and anchoring the black tie event strictly for couples… I shared experiences and gained experiences”. It would be recalled that Johnson dissolved his marriage with his fellow Nollywood colleague, Toyin Aimakwu. However, Johnson and Toyin has been throwing jabs to each other on social media on Toyin’s refusal to sign their divorce papers.
