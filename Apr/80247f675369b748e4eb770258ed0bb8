Nigerian Afropop star, Yemi Alade amd Grammy award-winning American rapper, Rick Ross have released the video for their latest collaboration, ‘Oh My Gosh’ remix. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the song is an upbeat, hiphop- styled take from the original song with Ross lending some bars to the DJ Coublon produced-mix. The colourful video features Yemi Alade and some vibrant dancers in eccentric Ankara pieces swaying to the music. Some cuts show the two singers cozied up as they vocalise the song. Yemi Alade had earlier shared a video of herself on Instagram @yemialade, teaching Ross how to dance shaku-shaku which the American superstar seemed to get a hang on.
