Two prominent title holders from  Bade Emirate in Yobe and kinsmen of Senator Ahmed Lawan have appealed to Senators Ali Ndume and Danjuma Goje, to step down and support the endorsement of Lawan for the President of the ninth senate come June, 2019. Alhaji Mamman Suleiman and Alhaji Mohammed Gagiyo, who spoke on behalf of Bade  Emirate, where Sen Lawan hails from  said the endorsement of Senator Lawan  by APC  leadership was in the best  interest of the North east and Nigeria in general. According to Suleiman, “as fellow compatriots of the region, we expect the two senators to support the senate leader following his endorsement by the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Nigeria in the last four years had suffered from unnecessary political conflicts between the executive and National Assembly which must not be repeated.” The Emirate urged all APC senators to remain united in the interest of the party and the country. Alhaji Mohammed Gagiyo, in his view said the experience of the senate leader in the National Assembly makes him more prepared and qualified for the office of the senate president. “As a region, we should exhibit the spirit of unity we are known for and support one of our own, Sen. Ahmad Lawan. “The people of Bade Emirate are solidly behind Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan for Senate President and, we call on our brothers, Ndume and Goje to step down for Lawan,” he said.
