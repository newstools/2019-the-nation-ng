A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Bwari, Abuja has voided the participation of Senator Ademola Adeleke of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the last governorship election in Osun State. Justice Othman Musa, in a judgment on Tuesday,  annulled Adeleke’s nomination as candidate of the PDP on the grounds that Adeleke offended section 177 of the 1999 constitution as amended. “The section states that candidates for the position of governor must be educated up to secondary school level. Justice Musa said while the court’s findings showed that Adeleke entered secondary school in 1976, there was no record showing that he (Adeleke) actually graduated. The judge said Adeleke’s name was no longer seen in the school’s register from 1980. The judgment was on a suit filed by two members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Wahab Raheem and Adam Habeeb. While plaintiff’s lawyer, Bankole Akomolafe hailed the court’s decision, lawyer to Adeleke, Nathaniel Oke (SAN) faulted the judgement. Oke said his client qualified for the election and met the relevant constitutional requirement, having been educated to secondary school level. He said a High Court in Osun State had, in an earlier judgment, confirmed that Adeleke was qualified, having attended a secondary school. “I asked the judge to make the certified true copy of the judgment available to us on time, because we are appealing the judgment,” Oke said.
