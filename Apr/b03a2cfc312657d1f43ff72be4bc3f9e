One look at Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, wife of Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, brings warmth to the heart and rightly so. She is a woman with unique qualities and impeccable character worthy of emulation. As she celebrates her 60th birthday today, these are seven things noteworthy about her. 1. Although she was born in Benin City on the 5th of April 1959, she is of mixed ancestry. She hails from the renowned Hajaig family of Lebanon and grew up in Ibadan in Oyo state. 2. She possesses a degree in Secretarial Studies and Management from The Polytechnic Ibadan as well as a Doctoral degree in a management science. She was on Monday 1st of April 2019 inducted as a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Resources Management and Politics (CIPRMP) based in Ghana. 3. She is the biological mother of five; four daughters and a son. In 2012, she adopted twin boys, Oluwaseyifunmi and Oluwaseunfunmi making her a mother of seven. 4. She is the Yèyé Ààré of Ibaanland. This title was conferred on her on the 16th of December 2016 by Oba Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadanland.  5. She is passionate about humanity. Florence Ajimobi is the founder of several humanitarian projects such as Access to Basic medical Care (ABC) foundation, Ajumose Food Basket, Educate A Rural Child project among many others. 6. She is also a philanthropist. She has donated a fully equipped ICT center to Ajayi Crowther University and is known for donating gift items and cash particularly to orphanages within Oyo state. 7. Her desire is to become a pastor at 60. She stated this wish at the August edition of Women Intercessory Network Prayer Rally in 2017. As she clocks 60 today, we do hope her wish comes true.
