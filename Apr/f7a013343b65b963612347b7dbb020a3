BARRING any last-minute change in plans, President Muhammadu Buhari will be in Lagos today for a working visit. He is billed to inaugurate five projects. Security operatives, including the Police and men of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), were seen yesterday taking positions in the areas to be visited by the President. Listed by the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for inauguration are: the 170-bed Institute of Maternal and Child Health at Ayinke House; the 10-lane Murtala Mohammed International Airport Road and the Lagos State Theatre, located at Oregun. The highpoint of President Buhari’s visit, according to the governor’s spokesman, Habib Aruna, is the inauguration of the Oshodi Transportation Interchange, and the 820 Mass Transit Buses. According to him, the interchange would cater for one million passenger traffic daily, with each of the terminals accommodating at least 300,000 passengers daily. The interchange and the new buses, he explained, are part of the Bus Reform Initiative (BRI) of the Ambode-led administration. Aruna noted that the interchange would afford Lagosians a new transportation experience that would ease commuters’ transportation stress. The Lagos Theatre at Oregun, another project to be opened by the President, was also an initiative of the Ambode administration to reposition arts, culture and theatre as a major economic hub of the government. Aruna said: “The President would also be visiting the Ayinke House where he would be declaring open the 170-bed Maternal and Child Health at Ayinke House. The Centre had been upgraded by former Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola. “Today’s visit is the second by President Muhammadu Buhari, who on March 29, 2018, inaugurated the Ikeja Bus Terminal, as part of activities slated to celebrate the birthday of All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.”
