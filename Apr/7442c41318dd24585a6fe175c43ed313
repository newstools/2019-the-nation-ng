Principal officers, including Speakers of the Houses of Assembly in the six Southwest states yesterday adopted harmonised reports to have a common standing order and house rules. The move was aimed at arresting indiscriminate impeachment of speakers and house leaders. The plan, the Southwest lawmakers said, would also help economic and political integration in the region. The lawmakers, at a meeting  in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, tagged: “Validation and adoption of harmonised standing orders for Southwest Houses of Assembly”, said the adoption of the rules would deepen democracy and checkmate what they called  executive recklessness. Chairman, Speakers Conference in Nigeria and the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, said the decision was beyond politics, but  for the progress of the region. At the meeting were the speakers of the Houses, deputy speakers, majority leaders of the house and selected members. Obasa said: “This is beyond politics, but a way to develop our democracy in the Southwest. Having same rules in the state Houses of Assembly in the region will beautify our democracy because there can’t be democracy without parliament. “It will also remove the acrimony that we are witnessing in the past where few people try to remove the speaker or change the system in the parliament. “Once we have conformity in our rules, nobody can do something otherwise and get away with it. It will also checkmate the excess of the executive in influencing the leadership of the Houses of Assembly without conforming with the provisions of the law.”
