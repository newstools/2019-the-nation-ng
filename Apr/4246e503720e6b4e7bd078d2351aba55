Five hundred and forty-three students have matriculated at the Fidei Polytechnic, Gboko, Benue State. It was the institution’s 19th matriculation held at its premises. Delivering his speech, the polythenic’s Acting Rector, Mr. Aper, Chris Igbadio, admonished the new students to be more committed to their studies. He warned that any student that flouted the rules and regulations of the institution would be dealt with. He said: “As you officially start the next level of your career, I urge you to be focused, and realise the task in front of you that will set you on the path of your profession and personal life. You must remember to be law-abiding at all time and constantly resist all forms of vices such as examination malpractice, cultism, theft, hooliganism, drug abuse, and fighting, that we consider unacceptable here. I encourage you to strive for excellence and never to spend time on social entertainment. Also, your primary aim of coming here is to study, and I urge you that we will make your stay here as pleasant as possible.” Benue State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Prof. Dennis Tyavyar, who was represented by Mr Utuku Iormough, congratulated the new students and charge them to be serious, steadfast, unrelenting, and give their all. “I, therefore, urge you all to be serious, steadfast, hard working, and also give your all to education. Polytechnics are always the best in terms of technology because students who undergo polytechnic education are never stranded in the labour market. They are usually well trained to be independent in terms of innovations, and entrepreneur skills, among others. Also, the ministry appreciate Fidei Polytechnic for good works in academic excellence.”
