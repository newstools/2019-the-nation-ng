The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday said the rising wave of insecurity across the country was unacceptable. It urged President Muhammadu Buhari to rise up to the occasion and come up sustainable strategies to address the situation. It also condemned incidences of inconclusive elections that characterised the last general election and series of violence and vote buying, saying such incidences were a major threat to the nation’s democracy. In a communique at the end of its Central Working Committee meeting in Abuja, the  Congress rejected planned hike in Value Added Tax (VAT) and removal of petrol subsidy by the government as a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the recommendations of the Bretton Wood institution has never been in the interest of the Nigerian people. Signed by Congress President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba and General Secretary, Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson,  it advised government to explore other means to raise fund for minimum wage implementation. It condemned incidences of hate speech, vote buying, ballot box snatching, abuse of provisions for manual accreditation, logistics tardiness and isolated cases of violence in the election.
