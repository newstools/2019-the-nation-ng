Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has called on all politicians in the state to take advantage of his post-election olive branch to develop the state. A statement by his media aide, Simeon Nwakaudu, said Wike spoke yesterday when the Governing Council of the Rivers State University visited him at the Government House in Port Harcourt. According to the governor, the state needs peace and security for rapid growth. He said: “We want everybody to take advantage of the olive branch if they love the state. We are not afraid of fight, but we want everyone to join us to work for the development of the state. “The state is uppermost on our mind. I will do everything possible to promote its peace. We thank God that all the political tension is behind us. You cannot govern a state when it is not peaceful. We continue to reiterate the need for peace. We want total peace and reconciliation.” Governor Wike urged the Rivers State University to check cultism, and advised the university to submit names of cultists to the government for necessary action. Wike also approved the employment of academic and non-academic staff, even as he reiterated that the government will implement the de-centralisation of the Rivers State University, with the Ahoada Campus to be built soon. The Pro-Chancellor, Justice Iche Ndu, said the Wike’s re-election is well deserved as it flows from the people. He decried the violence which greeted the election, and called on the political class to cooperate with the governor to promote peace. Justice Ndu implored the governor to invite elders, statesman, church leaders and mediators to take over the peace building process. He also urged the governor to approve the employment of new academic and non academic staff for the institution.
