The Coalition of Young Female Candidates (CYFC) has demanded more inclusiveness for female candidates in preparation for the 2023 elections. According to the group, the 2019 elections presented many challenges to female candidates. It said the low participation of women, lack of funding, injustice, insecurity and gender bias were some of the challenges female contestants battled with. The President of CYFC, Dr. Doris Opara, during the group’s press conference in Abuja on Monday tasked government on all levels to ensure the proper frameworks are in place before 2023 to support women who vie for public offices. “We support the bill of reserved constituency whereby certain constituencies are reserved for only female candidates,” she stated. “A woman must be the one to emerge in a constituency after the election as a winner. “We also need the government to create a bill that will support women in subsequent elections for mobilization and campaign funding. “There are also cases where candidates were beaten up in their constituencies and attacked in their houses by hoodlums. “We call upon security forces such as police and the military to fight for the women in upcoming elections.” Opara also harped on the implementation of the 35 percent affirmative inclusion of women in governance, insisting it must be included in the constitution as against just serving as a campaign strategy. “Political parties should reserve some positions for women during each general election other than that of the ‘Women Leader.’ “Women should also be given automatic tickets by all political parties and free nomination forms as well,” she stressed. The Media, Publicity and Social Innovation National Executive for CYFC and Representative of Imo State House of Assembly, Adaora Onyechere, urged media organisation not to exhibit partisan mindset in the reporting women in politics.
