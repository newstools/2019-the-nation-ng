The Director-General, Public Service Staff Development Centre (PSSDC), Magodo, Lagos, Dr. Senukon Ajose-Harrison, has urged learning and development practitioners in the public and private sectors to learn new skills, knowledge, right attitude and new approaches that will not only be useful for today, but also be of great impact in the 21st century. He spoke yesterday at PSSDC, Magodo, Lagos. Ajose-Harrison said learning and development were processes that brought about a relatively permanent change in behaviour, which occurred as a result of experience at the formal and informal levels. “It includes the acquisition of new skills, knowledge and right attitudes that ultimately culminates in the permanent change behaviour of the learner/ employee. “There is, therefore, the need for practitioners to learn new approaches and exchange ideas,” he said. Ajose-Harrison said the 21st century approaches in learning and development include personalisation, bite-sized support resources, training metrics and analytics, self-paced online training, gamification, responsive design, collaborative online training, virtual and augmented reality, among others. “The objective of the forum is to create room for exchange of ideas, networking and benchmarking of world best practices among learning and development practitioners in Nigeria and in the world”, he added. Facilitators at the event included the Registrar, Chartered Institute of Personnel Management in Nigeria, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle, represented by the Director for Professional Development and Standards, Dr. Charles Ugwu, who spoke on “Learning and Development, Integrating New Trends and Perspectives with Existing Approaches”. He said it is of great importance for learners to cope with the trends in the 21st century “so as to allow us flow with the trends.”
