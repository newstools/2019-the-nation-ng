Nigeria’s sprint sensation Divine Oduduru broke his Personal Best Stadium Record and set a World Leading time of 9.95s and 19.76s, to win 100m and 200m at the Michael Johnson Invitational in Waco, Texas. Oduduru, running for Texas Tech, beat his personal best by over a tenth of a second and is officially the fastest man in the world this year. The Delta State-born sprinter becomes the first Nigerian to break the sub 10s barrier since Olusoji Fasuba almost did so 13 years ago and he also broke Francis Obikwelu’s 20-year-old 200m National record of 19.84s. Oduduru, 22, said after the race: “I worked for it and I got it” “In my 35 years of coaching, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Tech coach Wes Kittley said after Oduduru recorded the double wins in the 100m and 200m events. “To run that 9.94 and then 40 minutes later, ran the 200m. This was a really tight schedule and pretty spectacular performances that close together.” Oduduru won the 200 metres at the past two NCAA championships — the outdoor last June in Eugene, Oregon, and the indoor in March at Birmingham, Alabama. He broke the Clyde Hart Stadium records of 10.02 and 20.30, both set by then-Baylor star Trayvon Bromell, who won the 2016 World Championships gold medal in the 60 meters. Oduduru also broke his previous school records: 10.10s that he ran last April, also at the Michael Johnson Invitational, and 20.13 that he ran last May at the Big 12 meet in Waco. Oduduru has the 200m fastest indoor time – 20.08s and 3rd fastest 60m indoor time at 6.52s. Oduduru is a five-time African Junior Champion and won the Silver medal at the 2014 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Eugene, USA. He also won the Silver medal at the 2015 African Games in Congo-Brazzaville.
