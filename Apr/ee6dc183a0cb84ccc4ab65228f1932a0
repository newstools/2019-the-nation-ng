The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has called on Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike to address the insecurity in communities being ravaged by cult wars and violence. MOSOP President Chief Legborsi Pyagbara, in a statement yesterday, appreciated Wike’s plea for reconciliation and forgiveness, even as he urged the people to embrace the call for reconciliation for the good of the state and its people. He said: “Rivers State has for long been on the tenterhooks, making the people a laughing stock in the comity of states, all for the negative reasons. The reconciliation call by Governor Wike is indeed redeeming, refreshing and the needed tonic for brotherhood, peace and good neighbourliness. “Governor Wike must match the call for reconciliation and forgiveness with clear and demonstrable actions, by reaching out to leaders of political parties, groups, individuals and communities who have been aggrieved in course of his governance and actions taken. “One way the governor can demonstrate this is to ensure that a rainbow coalition of members is put in place in the constitution of a new cabinet in the.” Pyagbara was sure economic and social lives would bounce back fully with the reconciliation and forgiveness, thereby making people happy and the state becoming a centre of attraction to local and international tourists, development entrepreneurs and investors. He promised that MOSOP would remain committed to and supportive of any institutional, government or individual efforts aimed at giving the people a sense of belonging and the state becoming a pride of place.
