Its Profit Before Tax (PBT) peaked at N615.6 million, with a marked YoY growth of 91 per cent from the N322.8 million realised the same period in 2017. Over the same period, the company grew its total assets YoY by 31 per cent from N7.24 billion in 2017 to N9.45 billion in 2018, achieving a significant improvement in capital efficiency as it nurtures robust liquidity and solvency margin above the required benchmark. Commenting on the company’s performance, FBN General Insurance Managing Director, Bode Opadokun, attributed the performance to the underwriting firm’s commitment in putting its clients first and resilience in achieving remarkable milestones. “The business gained momentum in 2018 as results across key performance metrics clearly validated FBN General Insurance’s commitment to the delivery of profitable growth and unwavering dedication to our clients, communities and stakeholders,” he stated. FBN General Insurance was acquired in 2014 by FBNInsurance Limited, an FBNHoldings Company associated with the Sanlam Group (SA) and was incorporated to transact general insurance business in Nigeria and currently operates out of several outlets nationwide. Last year, the underwriting firm won the Best Customer Service Award (Insurance Category), at the 2018 Nigeria Brand Award in Lagos.
