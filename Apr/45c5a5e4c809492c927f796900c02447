Despite being edged out from the group stage of the women’s singles at the concluded ITTF World Championships in Budapest, Olufunke Oshonaike said she is now focusing on the forthcoming African Cup and Games. Oshonaike told NationSport that she has used the World Championships to assess her fitness and weaknesses in order to correct them before the continental tournaments. “I have actually started my preparations for the African Cup and Games early this year and I came purposely to the World Championship to see the level of my fitness and also ascertain some of my mistakes in order to go back to my base in Germany and correct them. Now with what happened at the World Championships in Budapest, I was able to see some of my possible opponents in Africa with the hope of redoubling my efforts in training to be able to withstand them when the continental tournaments take place. ”There is no doubt that every player is playing well and nobody is a minnow in the sport again. I have noticed that I am fit what I just need to do is to work on my tactic before the championships,” the former African champion said. The Germany-based athlete, however, singled out debutant Ajoke Ojomu for her display particularly against her Korean counterpart in the second group match of the competition, describing the teenager as a bold and determined player that can spring a surprise at the continental tournaments. “I am really impressed with Ajoke Ojomu because being her first outing; she was able to stand her own against some of the best players in the world. I hope she continues training when she gets back to Nigeria in order to be in top shape for the continental championships later in the year,” Oshonaike said.
