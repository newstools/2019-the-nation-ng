As Christians celebrate Easter, marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Chairman of the South East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has charged Christians to use the solemnity of the season to heal all wounds arising from the last elections in the country. Umahi in his Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Emmanuel Uzor, said this year’s Easter is apt as it presents clear opportunity for Christians and Nigerians in general to heal the country and make peace with one another as the only panacea to development. Umahi said there is no sacrifice too much to make to achieve peace and called on Christians to emulate Jesus by giving all, adding that all that was not given is lost and prayed God to continue to sustain mankind in His everlasting love. He acknowledged that the country has been greatly wounded by various divisive political tendencies but said this year’s Easter should be the season to address all these challenges that face us as a people and learn to forgive one another in the spirit of Easter.
