An unemployed man, Sunday Joshua, 20, was yesterday sentenced to one-month imprisonment by an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for snatching a bag containing valuables Magistrate Mrs. M.O. Tanimola sentenced Joshua after he pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The court, however, gave the convict an option of N20,000 fine in lieu of serving the jail term. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti had earlier told the court that the defendant committed the offences in February at Ladipo, Mushin, Lagos. He said the defendant committed the offence with others still at large. According to the prosecution, the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by snatching a bag from a woman, whose identity was not disclosed. Koti told the court that when the defendant and his gang snatched the woman’s bag, she raised the alarm, which attracted people around. He said the people chased them and caught up with the defendant, who was arrested, while others escaped. The prosecutor told the court that the stolen bag was recovered. When the charge was read, Joshua admitted committing the offence levelled against him by the police and blamed his action on the devil. He pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing him. During facts and sentencing, Joshua again admitted guilt and the magistrate consequently convicted and sentenced him.
