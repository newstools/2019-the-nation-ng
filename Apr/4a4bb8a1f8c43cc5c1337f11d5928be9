Nigeria international Henry Onyekuru was omitted from the Galatasaray squad that beat Kayserispor 3-1 in the Turkish Super Lig on Saturday evening. The Everton loanee had to be dropped from the matchday 18 because he received a one-match ban as punishment for having accumulated four yellow cards. Onyekeru saw his first yellow card of the season against Kayserispor on November 10, was booked against Kasimpasa in February, before he was cautioned against Bursaspor (March 17) and Fenerbahce (April 14), which triggered a one-game ban. The left winger should be available for selection when Galatasaray travel to Konyaspor for their next league game on Monday, April 29. In 37 outings across all competitions this term, Onyekuru has been directly involved in 15 goals (12 goals, 3 assists). He is expected to link up with the Nigeria National Team at their training camp in Asaba in the first week of June ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
