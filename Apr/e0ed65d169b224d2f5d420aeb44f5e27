SHOULD Oyo House of Representatives member Olajide Olatubosun heed the advice of a youth-based group, the ATISBO/Saki East/Saki West Federal Constituency may join the race for the House Speaker. The socio-political group – Youths for Good Governance (YGG) in a statement said the time has come for someone from the state to aspire to lead the Green Chambers. It said that Olatubosun, being a ranking member of the lower chamber has what it takes to lead the House. Governor Abiola Ajimobi is rallying House of Representatives from the Pacesetter State to back House Leader Femi Gbajabiamila, who has declared interest in the position. YGG’s spokesman Shola Lawal said in the statement said:  “We will be so happy if Hon. Olajide Olatubosun presents himself for leadership position of the House. For long, Oyo has been relegated to the background especially in the progressive fold. “We should appreciate the fact that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has zoned the position to the South West. It is now incumbent on Olatubosun especially to come out and contest. “Our people shouldn’t concede everything to other people. We see it as not too good. If others aren’t coming out, Olatubosun is qualified. He should contest the speakership position. “There is no harm in trying something. Those who have achieved greater things took risk. Anything that is easy isn’t worth it; he should signify interest and we will do what is within our reach to support him.” The group, however, urged the lawmaker not to relent in his good deeds for his constituents, adding that they have rewarded the good things he has done in his first term by re-electing him.
