THE 2020 governorship race in Edo State is getting more and more interesting by the day. The sitting governor, Godwin Obaseki, is getting all manner of endorsements from stalwarts of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and local chapters of the party in the state, particularly in Governor Obaseki’s base in Edo South. They believe that the governor has performed and so deserves a second term. But there are people within the party who think otherwise and are really prepared to take on the governor. Among them is a former deputy governor, Dr. Pius Odubu, and a retired general, Charles Airavbiare, who was the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate in 2012 but lost to Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Airavbiare is now in APC. The two are believed to be oiling their machines for a showdown with Obaseki and are looking up to Abuja for help. Who it is they are looking up to in Abuja, no one knows. But the race, going by sentiments in the state, may turn out to be the home front versus Abuja front. It is reminiscent of the 1979/1983 National Party of Nigeria (NPN) race in the old Cross River, which saw the then Senate President, Joseph Wayas, leading the Lagos front against the home front of the then governor, Dr. Clement Isong.
