 Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson has added to his extensive tattoo collection with a lion, eagle and gloved hands inked onto his back. After the work was completed, the artist Adao Rosa posted a picture of the end product on Instagram. At the top of the back is some biblical imagery with a Christ-like figure and angel wings. Below is an eagle to the left, dragon on the right and then some goalkeeper hands catching a football above a very detailed image of a lion’s head Inch by inch, the 25-year-old seems to be covering his whole body. He already has a skull around his Adam’s apple and a rose beneath his ear. There are three female faces on his right arm above a sleeve. On the left arm there is a name on his bicep and a crown on top. On his chest is another nod to his religious beliefs with the words: ‘I belong to Jesus’, inked onto him.’ Ederson shows no sign of slowing down before long could have the majority of his body covered in tattoos. The City goalkeeper has again impressed on the pitch this season and been a key part of the team’s march towards a historic quadruple. He kept his 31st clean sheet in all competitions on Saturday in the 2-0 win over Fulham and is now preparing to take on Cardiff this Wednesday.
