Tottenham Hotspur lost 3-4 on Wednesday but reached the semi-finals of the 2018/2019 UEFA Champions League on away goals after a 4-4 aggregate score against Manchester City. Spurs, who won the first leg 1-0, will now face Ajax Amsterdam of Holland for a place in the final match against Liverpool or FC Barcelona. In a dramatic finale to an astonishing contest, Manchester City had a stoppage time goal from Raheem Sterling, which would have sent them through, ruled out for offside. VAR review confirmed that Sergio Aguero was offside in the build-up. In a breathtaking quarter-final second leg game in Manchester, City took a fourth minute lead through a beautiful curling shot from Sterling. But Spurs struck back with two quick goals from Son Heung-min — the second of them a magnificent finish. The manic opening period continued when Bernardo Silva brought the home side level in the 11th minute with a deflected shot. Then, Sterling struck again to make it 3-2 in the 21st minute. However, while a thundering strike from Aguero in the 59th minute put Manchester City in the driving seat again, they were again stunned in the 73rd minute. Spurs substitute Fernando Llorente bundled in a Kieran Trippier corner kick to restore the London club’s advantage through away goals.(Reuters/NAN)
