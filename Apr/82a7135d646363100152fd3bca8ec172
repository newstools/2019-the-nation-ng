FOLLOWING the success of the just concluded third installment of his comedy show series ‘Forever Funny With Forever’, comedian Akuidolo Orevaoghene,  known by his stage name Forever, has called out Nigerian comedians to understand the difference between comedy concerts which is what most of them do and comedy shows which is what he wants to be identified with. “We really hope that Nigerians understand and appreciate comedy for what it is to now,” Forever said in an interview. His show which held at the Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos had guest appearances like Bovi, Mc Abbey, Funny Bone, Lafup, Mc lively among others. “Most people think that a comedy show without musical interludes cannot work. When they appreciate the fact that comedy is comedy and what it does is to make you laugh, then they’ll know it can stand on its own without any form of support. “It borders on other comedians to virtually do the same and believe their brand is strong enough to make it work. If you want to do a comedy show I think you should focus more on comedy contents and make it more. At least we can start with not letting the musicians be more than the comedians in the comedy show and that way people are going to understand that comedy well stands by itself.”
