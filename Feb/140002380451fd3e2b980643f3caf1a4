To ascertain their condition, the Lagos State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL), is to conduct scientific test on general hospitals, bridges, shopping malls and other traffic infrastructure. The exercise is in continuation of the Non-Destructive Test (NDT) the agency did on some structures at the state secretariat in Alausa and the old secretariat in Ikeja GRA. During a visit to some general hospitals and the inspection of the agency’s five divisional offices, LSMTL Acting General Manager Olalekan Ajani said the government would explore all avenues to  guarantee safety of lives and property. On the outcome of the NDT,  Ajani said: “After the test conducted at Alausa in September 2018, we made our recommendations to the maintenance agencies of the government for action.” The government, he said, used its own buildings to show the public that it meant well as the exercise is not to victimise or inflict hardship on people. “What we are saying is that buildings, just like the human body, must be periodically tested to know the type of maintenance needed as when due. While we hail some individuals that are now approaching the agency to have their buildings tested, we want to appeal to Lagosians to willingly submit their buildings for testing without being prompted,” Ajani said. The agency, he said, had certified some independent material testing laboratories in the state to complement its efforts  in stopping building collapse.
