Fast-rising Ghanaian actress, Haillie Sumney, who is set to break into the Nigerian movie scene, in order to attract more fans and get international recognition has said many African actors risk contracting sexually transmitted diseases, STDs. The fair-skinned actress, who quit her nursing career at the Riverside Hospital, USA, for acting in Africa, said that many African entertainers do not belief in protection during sex. “Many African actors stand the risk of contracting Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV; I say this because African people can be very promiscuous and a lot of them do not believe in using condoms or using protection. They feel like they are ‘supermen’, and that HIV is not real. “I have friends and I talk to them, especially my male friends and a lot of them say that they do not use protection because they do not like it and that is the only reason that they give. When you mention HIV, a lot of them act as if it does not exist. So I would say that a lot of them are susceptible to HIV and STDs. According to Sumney, it is better and easier to break into Africa market through the Nigerian film market. “Nollywood is definitely a large market and well-recognised internationally,” she said. “So why would I wanted to break into it. And I love Nigeria. “Even though we have Jollof kind of war going on, Ghana and Nigeria goes hand in hand when it comes to music, movies and other stuffs. We are like brothers and sisters.” Sumney began her acting career  with a TV series, Heels and Sneakers produced by Yvonne Nelson and have featured in a movie, ‘A Way Back home’ alongside  with Alex Okubo, IK Ogbonna and a couple of other stars. She also starred in a movie ‘Lagos Fake Life’ produced by Mike Ezerounye.
