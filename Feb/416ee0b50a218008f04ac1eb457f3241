THE Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC), Oshodi, Lagos has certified 35 middle-level officers fit for entrepreneurship and managerial businesses. The certification followed a four-week intensive training for the officers from the ranks of Colonel downward, who will be retiring in a few years. This is the first time NAFRC will be holding this kind of programme for middle level officers. It has always held the programme for the lower ranks. Last year, it organised one for generals in collaboration with Empretec Nigeria Foundation. At the graduation, the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Western Naval Command (WNC), Rear Admiral Obed Ngalabak, advised the beneficiaries to make use of the skills and knowledge acquired in order to live well in retirement. He said the other courses the officers received during their military career were tailored towards improving their service to the country, pointing out that this one was exclusively meant to develop their individual capacities to work for themselves upon retirement. Ngalabak said: “I have been informed that in the last four weeks of intensive training, you have been exposed to presentations, lectures, discussions and several exercises as well as tour to Songhai Farm in Porto Novo, Benin Republic. “These were carefully and methodologically selected to equip you with skills and knowledge that will enable you confront and overcome the challenges you are likely to face in the entrepreneurship environment, during and after your disengagement from service.”
