Three men-Rasheed Olowu, 26, Kabiru Ibrahim, 24, and Seyi Asaolu, 26, have been granted N400,000 bail following their arraignment for allegedly being in possession of guns and belonging to a cult. An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court asked the defendants to provide two sureties each as part of the bail conditions. Chief Magistrate Yewande Aje-Afunwa said the sureties should show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Peter Nwangwu alleged that the defendants committed the offence last December 4 at 5pm, at Ajelogo Car Wash, Mile 12. He said the trio were apprehended by some policemen from Mile 12 Division during a stop-and-search. “The police discovered one cut-to-size locally made pistol with one live cartridge on one of the defendants without licence or permission from the Inspector-General of Police. “They could not give a satisfactory explanation about the ownership of the guns in their possession,” Nwangwu said. He alleged that the defendants were sometime last year found to belong to an unlawful society called ‘Eiye’ confraternity. The case continues on April 18.
