A Lagos-based educationist and social critic Orisadare Bilkis Wonuola, has hailed the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) governorship candidate Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu as regards education. Wonuola said it takes an administrator with foresight, competence and integrity to drive the development of education in Lagos to a higher height. She said: “One distinguished personality that has these attributes is Babajide Sanwo-Olu. He is capable, and forward-thinking. He is knowledgeable and reliable. It is not a surprise at all that APC fields him as the party gubernatorial candidate for Lagos State. She said there was no doubt that Sanwo-Olu’s government, when elected, would adopt a globally recognised modern STEM (Sceince, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), a system of education in its curriculum. “This is the best way to facilitate practical education and develop students’ talents and potentials. STEM teachers, I am sure will be employed across the state and will be equipped with adequate teaching materials.” “He also plans to establish After-School-Study-Halls across the state where volunteer tutors will prepare students for major exams. What else could be more practical than this gesture, she said. “It is therefore, also not surprising that his education policy also includes facilitating school rehabilitation programs to revive dilapidated schools and provide necessary learning tools for the public schools in Lagos.”
