Three social-cultural groups have accused the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Abia State, Mr Joseph Iloh, of using People’s Democratic Party (PDP) members as electoral officials in tomorrow’s election. The Concerned Abia Leaders, Abia Renaissance Group and Abia Elites for Good Governance urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene. They also petitioned the Department of State Services (DSS), National Security Adviser (NSA) and Inspector General of Police (IGP). The groups called for Iloh’s investigation and the immediate redeployment of INEC returning officers, collation officers and ad-hoc staff in Abia. They warned that retaining them means “that pre-determined election results will be declared after the rescheduled poll of February 23, 2019.” The Concerned Abia Leaders, through its president Mr Emeka Ukonu, a lawyer, and the Secretary General, Chief Desmond Obioha, urged President Buhari to investigate INEC’s list in Abia State which the group claimed is filled with 90 per cent PDP card carrying members. “Despite not holding brief for any political party, we shall not support any action (s) that will jeopardise the electoral process. “Contrary to the tenets of electoral process and democracy, which are anchored on transparency, probity and accountability, the officials of INEC in Abia have been compromised by the PDP for ulterior motives in a bid to short-change the will of the people. “Your Excellency Sir, it may interest you to note that most of the returning officers across Abia state are members or associates of top chieftains of the PDP. The personal relationships between the leadership of the INEC and top chieftains and members of the PDP in Abia state are not only worrisome but undemocratic. “All these atrocities couldn’t have been possible without the knowledge and support of the INEC Chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu and Resident Electoral Commissioner in Abia state, Mr. Joseph Iloh,” the groups alleged.
