Fifty unemployed youths, sponsored by the Lagos State Government for intensive computerised automobile repair training, yesterday graduated as mechanics. The ceremony took place at Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja. They graduated six months after they started the training at Automedics Nigeria Ltd, Ilupeju, Lagos. They were trained in auto-diagnosis, auto-electrical, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and heavy duty/diesel engine repair. Two hundred others graduated at the event, after acquiring employability skills, including critical thinking, problem solving and time management to secure good jobs and become outstanding entrepreneurs from a sponsored training at a Lagos-based Wave Academy. Wealth Creation and Employment Commissioner Mrs. Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf urged the graduands to make good use of the skills acquired to better their lives. She said: ”The emphasis is to give the youth skills in such a way that they are employable and also encouraged to embrace entrepreneurship, leveraging on innovative technology. Innovations in the automobile industry have gradually transformed what it means to be an auto repair worker. As the cars on the streets become more computerised, so it becomes more imperative to be able to properly diagnose, maintain and repair these computers on wheels. A trade that was once largely done through trial and error is today highly technical and therefore requires workers to have well-informed InfoTech skills.” The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport, Dr. Olufemi Salaam, said some of the graduands would be employed in the Lagos State Computerised Vehicle Service Unit of the ministry. Automedics Nigeria Ltd’s Chief Operating Officer Mr. Gbola Oba hailed the government for investing in the development of youths, thereby curbing unemployment.
