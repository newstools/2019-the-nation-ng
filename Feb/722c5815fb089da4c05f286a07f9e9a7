No fewer than 66 persons were killed on Tuesday during a clash between armed bandits and residents of Dan Jigba town in Zamfara state. Our correspondent gathered that about seven villagers were killed when bandits numbering over 180 stormed the town near Tsafe local government area. But the villagers mobilised and resisted the attack, which reportedly lasted for about four hours. At least 59 of the bandits were said to have been killed by the courageous villagers. Our correspondent noticed that three military vehicles with soldiers have arrived the town since Wednesday morning as the villagers also prepare for another round of resistance against the expected attackers. Acting Force Information Officer Major Clement K Abiade told our correspondent the military authorities were aware of the incident and had mobilised men to the scene. One of the villagers, who identified himself as Chairman Malaha, told our correspondent on phone they were compelled to resist the bandits because they were tired of extortion. It was gathered that over 100 villagers were abducted recently by the bandits. Danjibga is a commercial town with many affluent people, making them an easy target for the bandits. Residents told our correspondent the bandits force abductees to pay as much as N5-15million. During a recent wedding ceremony, the bandits were said to have disguised as women and killed the family head before seizing over 15 women, who are said to have been in captivity for over 20 days. Our correspondent gathered the ruffled bandits were regrouping for another attack on the villagers, infuriated by the strong resistance during Tuesdayâ€™s attack.
