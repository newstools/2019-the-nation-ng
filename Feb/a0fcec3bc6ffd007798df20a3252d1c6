President Muhammadu Buhari has been requested to break down the circumstances that may warrant action by security agents against those assumed to be constituting threat to a smooth conduct of elections. Making the request at a media briefing in Warri on Friday, a member of the Campaign Committee of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Warri North council area of Delta state, Chief Newuwumi Omolubi, said he requested for the clarification so as to preserve the lives of his people during the elections. Describing the president’s pronouncement as dangerous and disturbing to his people, especially those in his ward where about four military houseboats are already stationed, he said an explanation would help to prevent occasions that could lead to fatality, considering the fact that the people have always helped staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in conveying their materials to polling units. He said, “in between the four communities in my ward, there is a military houseboat. Now if the people who most times help the INEC people to convey their materials, at which stage will Buhari want the soldier to shoot. “The communities are the ones that help the INEC staff to move these materials because of the distance and the difficult terrain, so at which stage does it become dangerous for my people. “I am seeking this clarification to guide my people to know when to stop their services to the Adhoc staff of INEC to avoid killing of innocent civilians whose main concern is to help INEC smooth operation”, he said. He used the opportunity to call on the people of the communities and Deltans in general to come out enmasse and vote the PDP and its candidates.
