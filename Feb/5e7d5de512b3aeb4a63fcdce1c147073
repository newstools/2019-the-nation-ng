 Super Eagles midfielder John Ogu has advised whoever cares to listen and indeed the youths in particular to take information on social media with a pinch of salt as all that glitters is not gold. The Hapoel Be’er Sheva of Israel midfielder noted that many people claim to be what they are not adding that wisdom comes to play if anyone is to avoid going astray. Apparently irked by social media braggers, the former Académica ace, who was recently handed partial custody of his daughter Ivanna in an ongoing divorce suit with his wife Veronica, simply concluded by urging everyone to be wise. “Only on Social media everyone forms, I DONT CARE .Many are actually not what you see them form or brag about on Social Media. BE WISE!!!,” he cautioned He also appeared to be addressing the avalanche of advice that comes rolling in like tornadoes whenever there is a crack in relationships. “Many will form Motivational advisers on Social Media but in reality they are worse” he noted Ogu who joined Hapoel Be’er Sheva in 2014 has so far made over 140 appearances for the side scoring 13 goals. The 30 year old that was part of the Super Eagles squad to the last World cup in Russia, will be hoping to be part of action when Eagles reconvene ahead of the last AFCON qualifier against Seychelles in March. Hapoel Be’er Sheva are 7th on the 14-team Isreali league with 29 points in 22 matches.
