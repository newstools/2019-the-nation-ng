Profit-taking in some large-cap stocks has dragged Nigerian equities to a loss of N84.4 billion but investors stepped up bargain-hunting for value stocks ahead of the announcement of the final results of the presidential and National Assembly elections. With more gainers than losers and 46.6 per cent increase in turnover, the equities market showed underlying positive sentiment. However, losses suffered by some highly capitalised companies including Nestle Nigeria Plc, Nigeria’s highest-priced stock, dragged the overall market position to negative. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) dropped from its opening value of N12.194 trillion to close at N12.109 trillion. The All Share Index (ASI)- the main value-based index at the Exchange declined by 226.30 points or 0.69 per cent to close at 32,473.82 points as against its opening index of 32,700.12 points.

Analysts at Cordros Capital noted that in the absence of a positive catalyst, as well as the still tense political milieu, investors should trade cautiously in the short term. “However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals and compelling valuation remain supportive of recovery in the mid-to-long term,” Cordros Capital stated.
