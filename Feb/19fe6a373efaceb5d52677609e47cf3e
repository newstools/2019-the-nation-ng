The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has said it had suspended its protest scheduled to hold yesterday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, following intelligence that politicians had hijacked it. The union also accused some members, especially its national body, of collecting money from politicians, ostensibly to divide and keep quiet over the postponed general elections in the country. Its National Public Relations Officer (PRO), Azeez Adeyemi, who addressed reporters in Abeokuta, urged his colleagues to urgently return the money to the donors. Adeyemi regretted that politicians had infiltrated NANS’ ranks and sponsored human rights groups to hijack their protest. The union leader assured the nation that the bad elements within its fold would be reported to law enforcement agencies for questioning and prosecution, if necessary. The NANS spokesman issued 48-hour ultimatum to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to address the nation and assure Nigerians of “free, fair and credible” elections. He noted that the students’ body had not recovered from the shock of the postponement but urged Nigerians to remain calm and focused. Adeyemi also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give INEC the necessary support to ensure free, peaceful and credible general elections.
