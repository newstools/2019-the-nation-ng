THE Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) yesterday released the report of the helicopter crash involving Agusta Westland W 139 Caverton Helicopters, which flew Vice President to Kabba in Kogi State. It attributed the February 2, 2019, crash of the chopper marked with registration number 5N â€“ CML to effects of a brownout generated during its landing in a dry dusty environment. It said Caverton should have carried out risk assessment test at the Kaaba Stadium before the flight. Brown out in aviation parlance means a condition generated during landing in a sandy and dusty environment. The chopper accident operated by Caverton Helicopter occurred at Kaaba Stadium in Kogi State. It flew Osinbajo, his entourage and three crew members. The chopper was manufactured in 2012. AIB Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Akin Olateru , at a media briefing at its headquarters at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, said though the investigation into the crash is ongoing, it has , however, issued two safety recommendations to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and the operator, Caverton Helicopters Limited. Olateru said the NCAA should issue advisory circular to helicopter operators on the effects of brown out and how to mitigate its effects. The second safety recommendation, Olateru said, is for Caverton Helicopters to carry out proper risk analysis and assessment before operating flights into unapproved landing pad. He said the final report on the accident will be released in few months.
