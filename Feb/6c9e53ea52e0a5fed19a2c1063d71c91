The lawmaker representing Ovia in the House of Representatives, Barrister Omosede Igbinedion, has said she is proud to be the youngest woman in the 8th Assembly about to terminate. Barrister Igbinedion, who lost her return bid to candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Dennis Idahosa, said it was a thing of pride for her to be the first woman from Edo State to ever go to the House of Representatives. Igbinedion, in a statement, said the electoral fraud and intimidation that led to her mandate being stolen was worrisome and threat to women limited place in a deteriorated democracy. She stated that women only had 6.4 percent representation in the present administration, a regression from the President Goodluck Johnathan’s 33 percent in accordance with the global affirmative action quota of 35 percent. According to her: “Women deserve to have their needs represented by someone who truly understands them, women deserve the opportunity to participate in the political space and occupy a seat at the decision-making table. “To the young women in Ovia, whether in an official capacity or not, I shall continue to fight for us and champion our issues. Women let’s ask for more, we deserve more.”
