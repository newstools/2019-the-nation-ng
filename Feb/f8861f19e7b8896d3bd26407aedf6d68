A 34-year-old salesman, Bayo Matthew, who allegedly stole pure water (sachet water) worth N152, 900 from his employer, was yesterday brought before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said the defendant committed the offence between November 2018 and last year, at 87, and 89, Ilaje Road, Bariga, Lagos. She alleged that the defendant, a salesman and driver for Ozone, a company that produces pure water, had been stealing bags of sachet water from the company worth N152, 900 for over three months. The prosecutor said the company’s accountant, Mr. Toyin Dahunsi, discovered the theft while trying to balance the end of year (2018) sales. “My lord, upon investigation, it was discovered that the defendant had been taking out some bags of water from his truck for months.”
