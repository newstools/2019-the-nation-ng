The Heritage Agro-Allied Foods Nigeria Ltd (H2A) is partnering with the Edo State government, Elephant Group and Von Foods to develop processing of High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). The Managing Director of H2A Foods, Dr Tony Bello, said on Wednesday in Lagos that HQCF also known as “Tapioca Flour” would be processed into nutritious consumer foods like snacks in Nigeria. ‘The HQCF policy of the Edo Government has gone beyond cassava bread. “What we are working on is the transformation of staple crops into industrial food ingredients such as gluten-free tapioca flour and extruded snack foods. “Our goal is to engage thousands of small scale cooperative farmers in Edo to grow cassava for processing into tapioca flour, flakes, granules and snack foods,” Bello said in a statement. According to him, H2A, a U.S.-based Food Science and Technology company is facilitating the 6 million dollars investment plan as well as institutional investments and private sector partners under a strategic public private partnership platform with Edo Government.
