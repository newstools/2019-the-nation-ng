The prosecution in the charge against the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Wlater Onnoghen before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has applied for the issuance of a warrant of arrest on him (Onnoghen). Lead prosecution lawyer, Aliyu Umar (SAN) made the application at the resumption of proceedings on Wednesday morning. Umar noted that Onnoghen has consistently absented himself from the tribunal since proceedings commenced on the charge in January this year. He said both the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) and the Practice Direction of the CCT provides that a defendant must be present in court before any proceedings can be conducted in respect of a pending charge. Lawyer to the defendant, Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN) is currently making a counter-argument, urging the court to, among others reject the prayer for the issuance of an arrest warrant against Onnoghen.
