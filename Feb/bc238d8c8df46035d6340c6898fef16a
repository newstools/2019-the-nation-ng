Students nationwide are trooping to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) offices across the country to be registered as ad-hoc staff following the suspension of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike. In Kaduna State, students besieged the 23 local governments for the ongoing training of INEC ad-hoc staff for the general elections which begin on Saturday with the presidential and National Assembly polls. The trainees also comprised serving and former corp members, MDA staff members and  students of federal or state tertiary institutions alike. Secretary-General Kaduna Polytechnic Students’ Union Comrade Mubarak Abdulganiyi described the development as; “an indication of hardship in the country.” Idris Ibrahim, a student from Usman Dan Fodio University (UDUS) undertaking his training at Igabi LGA also agreed with Mubarak. “Poverty is the principal cause and with the effect of the strike, students crowd the centres. If people have work to make ends meet, they wouldn’t be so disturbed about INEC ad-hoc staff”. While Olorunshola Samuel – an undergraduate of Kaduna State Polytechnic undergoing his training at Kaduna South also lamented over the development: “The incapacitated government and the self-centered academic union have led to the enormous participation of students in the ongoing INEC Ad-hoc training”. The hard-working students who don’t want to remain idle have to be engaged in the training to earn a living” For Ogunwole Moses, who is undertaking his training in Kaduna South LGA simply believed the catchy payment and ASSU strike are responsible for the turnout”. It’s crystal clear that the enormous participation of students can be attributed to the effect of industrial action being embarked by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), as well as the intense idleness and hardships growing among students. It’s therefore necessary of them to opt for a temporary income jobs while FG-ASUU negotiations continue.
