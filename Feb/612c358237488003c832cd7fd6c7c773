Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi on Monday approved monthly release of N100 million to defray accumulated gratuities of retired workers in the State. Fayemi, in further demonstration of his administration’s commitment to the welfare of workers and pensioner, had last month approved a hundred per cent increase in monthly gratuity payment from N10 million to N20 million. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode, explained the directive takes immediate effect, pending the time the state government would be able to find a creative approach to resolve the huge outstanding gratuity obligations of the state. The Governor believes the increment will ameliorate the plight of the state’s pensioners and also accelerate their living standard. In a related development, Governor Fayemi has also approved the payment of severance allowance and outstanding salaries of 19 former members of the Ekiti State House of Assemblies and their aides who were denied their entitlement by the immediate past administration of Mr. Ayodele Fayose. Fayemi said it is unjust to deny workers their wages, stating his administration will ensure that workers and pensioners get their entitlements at the appropriate time.
