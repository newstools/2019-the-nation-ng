Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria, Tourism, Miss Danielle Hafsat Jatto, has been named the ambassador for the All Nigerian Festival. Jatto was unveiled on Wednesday at the Nike Art Gallery, Lekki, Lagos ahead of the second edition of the annual event. Speaking on why Jatto was chosen as Ambassador, founder of All Nigerian Festival,  Mr Kupa Victory, said, “I watched MBGN and when it got to her turn to answer certain questions I saw the passion in her. An individual can just be interested in winning the title but she wasn’t just there to win the title and I saw the passion when she won Miss Tourism and I said to myself this is the ambassador we’ve been looking for. “So that was what prompted us as organisers to take a collective decision to endorse her as our ambassador.” Kupa further added that the new ambassador will help to create a synergy between private sector and government for the promotion of tourism. One of the major tasks is that shes going to be creating the synergy between the private sector and government who should provide an enabling environment for tourism. On her appointment, Danielle Jatto expressed joy and vowed to do her best to promote tourism. “I promise I’m going to do a lot but I plan to start up a tourism firm in Nigeria,” Jatto said. “If you look at countries America, China and Dubai you will realize that most of their revenues come from tourism.” Organisers also disclosed that following the official unveiling, members of the ANF and the new brand ambassador will hit the ground running with a nationwide sensitization and courtesy visit tour to stakeholders, heads of Ministries and Government to garner support and participation for the 2019 edition of the festival billed for April 2019, to be hosted by one of the 36 states of the federation.
