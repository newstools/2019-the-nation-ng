An Abuja-based cleric, Rev. Isaiah Oluwaniyi, has called on Nigerians to exercise their civic duties by voting for candidates of their choice in the upcoming elections. Oluwaniyi of the Basilica of Grace Anglican Church, Gudu, Abuja, made the call in Abuja on Sunday during his Sermon entitled: ‘‘God’s Wrath Against Unrighteousness.’’ ‘‘Please, I urge you all to go out and vote and collect you Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) if you have not. Election day is not a day to sleep; go out and vote.’’ The priest also warned against electoral malpractice, saying ‘‘no man should rig the election, whether big or small, such person will face the wrath of God.’’ Quoting from the Bible, Oluwaniyi said God will visit the wicked and unrighteous with His wrath, because the wicked are liars, murderers, idolaters, adulterers, immoral, greedy, unforgiving, proud and those who want to rig election. ‘‘The Bible says in Romans 1: 18 – For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteous of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. ‘‘Psalm 7: 11 says – God judgeth the righteous, and is angry with the wicked every day. ‘‘Anyone who involves in rigging elections is wicked and God’s wrath will be upon that person,’’ he said.
