After eight consecutive days of rising share prices, Nigerian equities took a breather yesterday as profit-taking transactions in many large-cap stocks tripped the balance to negative. With 22 decliners to 19 advancers, the market closed with a marginal average decline of 0.15 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N18 billion. The All Share Index (ASI)- the benchmark index at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), declined from its opening index of 32,462.31 points to close at 32,413.92 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also declined from the opening value of N12.106 trillion to close at N12.088 trillion. These moderated the average year-to-date return to 3.13 per cent. As investors sought to monetise and lock in capital gains that accrued over the past eight trading sessions, several stocks across the sectors came under sell pressure. Consequently, most sectoral indices closed in the negative. The NSE Banking Index led with a drop of 1.79 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index dropped by 2.24 per cent while the NSE Insurance Index dipped by 0.73 per cent. However, the NSE Industrial Goods Index appreciated by 1.61 per cent while the NSE Consumer Goods Index rose by 0.89 per cent. “We expect to see sustained profit taking in previous advancers in the last two sessions before the elections,” Afrinvest Securities stated.
