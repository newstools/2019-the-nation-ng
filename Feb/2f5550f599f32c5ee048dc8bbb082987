The  Ladipo Auto-parts Market in Mushin, may be shut  till further notice because of its dirty environment, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has warned. Spokesman Obinna Onyenali said the authority’s attention had been drawn to the unwholesome environmental practices by the traders. Such practices, he said, had resulted in indiscriminate dumping of waste and degradation of the environment. Onyenali said the authority was doing everything to ensure that trading was conducted in a clean and safe environment. LAWMA’s trucks, he said, were being deployed for timely  waste evacuation and sweeping of the markets. “However, these efforts are being tainted by the activities of mischievous persons who will rather dump their waste indiscriminately on the roads than patronise their assigned Private Sector Participation (PSP) operators. “LAWMA condemns in strongest terms this unwholesome act being perpetrated by traders at Ladipo Market, as it exposes the environment and people that do business there to health dangers. “The authority takes this opportunity to urge traders at the market to turn a new leaf or face the consequences of the law. “If these acts against the environment continue unabated, the market will be shut till further notice,” Onyenali said in a statement.
