The Deputy National Coordinator (South) for Buhari/Osinbajo Presidential Support Committee, Senator Kamal Babalola-Odunsi, has urged the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to hold Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun responsible for the violence that marred the presidential rally in Abeokuta, the state capital, on Monday. Odunsi, who represented Ogun West in the Seventh Senate, said the governor, as the chief host and chief security officer of the state, should explain how thugs seized the main bowl of Moshood Abiola Stadium, venue of the rally, and pelted dignitaries, including President Muhammadu Buhari, with stones. He said: “It was a show of shame. It was well thought out. Why were the APC members and supporters chased out of the stadium by members of Allied Progressives Movement (APM) at the APC rally? We of the APC foresaw what would happen that day and appealed to our members to remain calm in face of provocation. “In fact, our leader, Chief Olusegun Osoba, said if he got to the stadium and was molested or harassed and was not allowed to get to the podium, he would stand among the crowd. He told us if they chase you out of the stadium, just find a way to safety; that we should avoid any confrontation with any group. “I was not surprised with what happened at the stadium. I am happy our members acted in a matured manner. If they had reacted to the harassment and intimidation, the President wouldn’t  come to the stadium and they will blame APC for it. “For me the national leadership of APC has the challenge of dealing with the situation. But the APC National Working Committee (NWC) has decided to deal with the governor after the election. To me, it’s medicine after death. How can we have an APC rally taken over by placard carrying APM members, chasing away APC members from the same rally?”
