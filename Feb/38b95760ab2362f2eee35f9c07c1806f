He died in the hospital- police A 45-year old man, Osifo Okeguare, has reportedly died in police cell at the Ekpoma Divisional Police headquarters in Esan West local government areas. It was gathered the police detained him after his family could not raise the N20, 000 demanded to release him on bail. An activist, Mr. Kola Edokpayi, alleged that the family raised N15, 000 but the IPO in charge of case insisted on keeping the deceased. But spokesman for the Edo Police Command, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, said the late Osifo and one Richard Femi, on February 10, 2019, were arrested while attempting to steal a motorcycle where it was parked. DSP Nwabuzor said Osifo took ill while in police cell and was taken to the Eremosele hospital in Ekpoma for treatment where he later died. Nwabuzor said his corpse was deposited at the Iruekpen General hospital for autopsy examination. He appealed to members of the family to remain calm and law abiding until the autopsy examination is made known.
