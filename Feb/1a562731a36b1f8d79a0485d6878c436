The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Tuesday, said it had arrested a suspected drug trafficker, who tried to smuggle 77 wraps of cocaine, weighing one kilogramme out of the country. Head of Public Affairs of the agency, Mr Jonah Achema, stated this in a statement in Abuja. Achema said that the 50-year-old suspect had ingested the wraps of cocaine but was nabbed at Kano International Airport during the outward screening of passengers of Tarco Airline, bound for Khartoum, Sudan. He said that the suspect, Adam Abubakar-Muhammed, who hails from Maiduguri, Borno, “basking in the validity of his `charms’ had boasted to persons close to him that no amount of screening by NDLEA will reveal him with any substance’’. Achema said that Muhammed had initially tested negative when he was X-rayed, “only for him to start excreting the illicit substance when he was kept under observation based on reliable intelligence’’. He said that the suspect was only fluent in Kanuri language and had confessed that he accepted the offer of N800, 000 to carry the drugs to enable him revive his hyde and skin business. NAN
