After thumbing Salitas FC of Burkina Faso 2-0 in the first group tie of the CAF Confederation Cup, Rangers’ striker, Ibrahim Ajani believes they would not be carried away by the victory but remain humbled going into the next match away to Tunisia’s CS Sfaxien on February 13. The victory shoots Rangers to the top of Group B after CS Sfaxien won the Tunisian El Clasico 1-0 against Etoile du Sahel in Sousse. Ajani, who featured in the entertaining encounter played at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu, told NationSport yesterday that they are aiming for another victory when they visit the Tunisian giant next week. “I must tell you that there is no pushover team in the group. Even though we won 2-0 but it was a hard fought win despite going ahead early into the encounter. We will continue to raise our game knowing well that the Tunisian side is always tactical in their approach. We will be hoping to repeat our home form away,” he said. The former Enyimba of Aba star described the win against the Burkinabe side as a good start for the team in the group. “I think we need the win being the first group match and this will surely motivate us going into the next game. When we play away against the Tunisian side, we will not be playing under any pressure because we were not considered as favourite because the North African sides were former champions and they are highly-rated in the continent,” he added. The Ogun State-born star admitted that the support from the management of Rangers has been the motivating factor for the team while hoping that the team would repay their support with good results. “Winning all our home matches are crucial to our qualification to the knockout stage and this I believe we can achieve with determination and support from the home fans. I am confident that team is poised to make the country proud in the championship,” Ajani opined.
