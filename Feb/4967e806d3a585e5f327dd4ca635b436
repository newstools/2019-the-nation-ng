Authorities of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, have suspended the Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Prof. Monday Igbafen, for alleged sexual harassment. Igbafen, an Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy, was alleged to have threatened female students with sex-for-marks. A statement by the universityâ€™s spokesman, Mr. Edward Aihevba, said the suspension followed the arraignment of Prof. Igbafen before the Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee (SSDC) on allegations of gross misconduct bordering on sexual harassment and threat of marks for sex. Aihevba said Igbafen had been found culpable and indicted by an investigative panel of the university for sexual harassment. He said a family of a female victim had threatened to drag the institution before the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) if it failed to bring Prof. Igbafen to book. Igbafen said he would expose the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ignacious Onimawo, to the world that blackmail would not work in the university. He said the suspension was part of a grand plan to intimidate ASUU chapter in the university.
