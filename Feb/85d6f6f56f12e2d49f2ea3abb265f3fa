Senator Solomon Adeola aka Yayi has pledged to work for the recognition and inclusion of the 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) created by the Lagos State Government in 2003 in the constitution. Speaking during a meeting with stakeholders in Oshodi as part of his “House-to House, Street-to-Street” campaign in the area comprising Oshodi-Isolo Local Government, Isolo and Ejigbo LCDAs, he berated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for frustrating moves to recognise these LCDAs all these years. He added that it was unjust for Lagos to have only 20 local governments, while Kano with a similar population has 44. “For me, the created LCDAs in Lagos State are legal as decided by the highest court in the land. The PDP-led Federal Government in the past frustrated the attempt for the inclusion of the LCDAs in the constitution. Now that we have an APC-led Federal Government, I am very hopeful that the LCDAs will be included in the constitution. Already they have enough structures to rival most local governments in the constitution” Adeola said. He urged the electorate to vote for All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates in the forthcoming elections, stressing that only a progressive APC government at the federal level could facilitate the recognition of the LCDA. The senator said: “As your representative from the largest senatorial district in Nigeria, I have delivered on core mandates of lawmaking with sponsorship of 15 bills, two of which were passed as constitutional bills.
