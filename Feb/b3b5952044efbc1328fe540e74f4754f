Residents of Baruwa Inside in Ayobo/Ipaja Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State have sought the government’s help in attacking the flood ravaging their community. They said it was threatening their lives and properties. The Nation learnt that when it rained some days ago, God of Elijah, Abimbola Taylor, Goshen Close, Candos Road, Soundhope Avenue and others were flooded, forcing many residents to flee. The inhabitants said the yearly flood had become a nightmare to them. They said they did not experience flood in the past, adding that the problem began about seven years ago following erosion in areas such as Oluwaga Road and Akinyele bus stop on Ipaja Road. A resident, Mr. Ben Azihawe, said the flood had become a threat, with some landlords abandoning their houses. Another resident, Mr. Sulaimon Afolabi, said the Community Development Association (CDA) had made efforts to address the problem, to no avail. The people said they had written to the government, Ayobo/Ipaja LCDA and informed the lawmakers representing the area about the problem, “but we are yet to get positive result.”
