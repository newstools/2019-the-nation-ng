The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA ) on Tuesday said it was yet to identify the airline that had a worn out aircraft tyre trending on social media Its spokesman, Sam Adurogboye, said though it was yet to establish the carrier whose aircraft allegedly had such a worn out tyre but insisted in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) no airline operator can embark on commercial air transportation for hire and reward without airworthy operating aircraft. Citing the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) Part 5.4.1.1, Adurogboye said the Authority only issues a Certificate of Airworthiness for aircraft registered in Nigeria based on satisfactory evidence that the aircraft complies with the design aspects of the appropriate airworthiness requirements (type certificate) and is in a condition for safe operation. He said NCAA’s Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASI), who are well trained and motivated carry out routine ramp inspection on all airlines operating in Nigeria. He said it is the primary responsibility of the Authority Inspectors to ensure all parts of the aircraft complies with the applicable airworthiness requirements and remains in a condition for safe operation before every flight and throughout its operating life. In addition to the Authority oversight roles, NCAA, he said has placed the onerous responsibility of the first line of safety on the operating airlines’ Pilot-in-Command of each flight and the assigned Engineer that authorised each flight. Adurogboye said: “With all the various checks and counter checks put in place by NCAA combined with that of the operators, it is therefore improbable that any airline in Nigeria will operate a service with that kind of tyre. “However, NCAA wishes to advise the original author of the post or any other individuals with safety related issue, if any to furnish the Authority with the identity of the airline or any of such information to enable us establish the authenticity of the claim and ensure appropriate action. “The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) will continue to carry out surveillance on the industry to ensure safety and security of airline operations in Nigeria and it is pertinent to point out that violation is viewed seriously.”
