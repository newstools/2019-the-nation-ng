The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) on Wednesday told the Federal High Court in Lagos that it was unable to serve former National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Director-General Ambassador Ayodele Oke and his wife Folasade with the money laundering charge filed against them. Prosecuting counsel Rotimi Oyedepo told Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke that the defendants where still outside the court’s jurisdiction. “We are having issues with service of the charge,” Oyedepo said. According to him, the commission made unsuccessful efforts to reach Oke and his wife. “We have gone to their known addresses but could not find them to be able to serve them with the charge,” Oyedepo said. He noted that the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) empowers the judge to make an order compelling the defendants’ appearance. But, Justice Aneke said he could not make any such order because the case was not yet properly before him. “I’ve not seen your file. It’s when I see the file that I can determine the urgency of any application. “I can’t exercise my discretion without seeing the efforts you’ve made on paper,” the judge said. He asked Oyedepo to return in 24 hours with the necessary processes. The defendants’ whereabouts is unknown, with reports saying they had left the country. Oke and his wife were charged in connection with the $43, 449, 947, 000 found in Flat 7B, No. 16 Osborne Road, Osborne Towers in Ikoyi Lagos. Justice Muslim Hassan had on June 6, 2017, granted a final forfeiture order of the funds since no one appeared before the court to claim them. The four-count charge against the couple was signed by Oyedepo, Nnaemeka Omewa and Idris Abubakar Mohammed. EFCC in the Proof of Evidence revealed how Flat 7B was bought for $1, 658,000 (N596, 880,000) It said one Alhaji Shehu Usman Anka will give evidence of the receipt of the sum of $1, 658,000 from the wife of the ex-NIA boss. The anti-graft agency also said that the agency got about $289, 202, 382.00 from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It added that one Benjamin Kiksenenso will give evidence of how he was instructed to go to the CBN to collect the $289, 202, 382.00. The charges against the ex-NIA boss are: “That you, Amb.
