As Georgia Oboh makes her debut at the Ladies European Tour (LET) in 2019 tagged ActewAGL Canberra Classic in Australia, the Nigerian teenager is hoping to make the final cut at the three-day tournament holding in Canberra, Australia. An excited Oboh told NationSport yesterday that she would continue to give her best in her quest to achieve her dream of becoming the first African to top the golfing world. Oboh, who has been touted as one of the rookies to watch out for in the competition said: “So far I want to thank my family and supporter all over the world for their support in this my golfing career and I will surely give my best in the sport.” She added: “Being my debut in the LET tournament, I hope to play against some of the world best and learn from them. Specifically, I want to make the cut and see what I can achieve here in Australia.” Oboh who celebrated her 18th birthday on Tuesday will compete against some of the best female golfers in the world. Also, home girl – Leona Maguire made an encouraging start to her season as a rookie professional on the Ladies European Tour with a tie for 20th place in the Australian Ladies Classic – Bonville, but feels that she can do better in the ActewAGL Canberra Classic at Royal Canberra. The 24-year-old, who slipped down the leader board with a final-round 75, said: “I was happy enough with last week but I would have liked to have finished better on the last day. I got myself into a nice position after the third day. It was a decent start and now I’m looking forward to kicking on.” Maguire partnered the defending champion Jiyai Shin in a long drive and nearest the pin shootout on Tuesday and the pair last played together during a practice round at the 2012 Women’s British Open at Royal Liverpool, also known as Hoylake, where Shin dominated the field in tough conditions to win by a nine stroke margin.
