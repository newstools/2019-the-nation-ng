The Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has challenged Africans and development experts to rethink development financing to reach the poorest communities on the continent in order to give them access to markets, education and healthcare. Emir Sanusi who made this known in his keynote at the 21st Eminent Speakers Lecture Series of the African Development Institute at the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) headquarters in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire stressed that “development needs to impact those at the bottom of the pyramid.” According to a release by the AfDB, Sanusi is quoted saying: “And as Africans and policy makers, our mindset, our attitude and our approach to development needs to change. “If you ask me whether the African Development Bank Group should invest in roads and railways in Kano, or invest in education, I would choose the latter. “I would choose training the people so that they can become Engineers and build their own roads in future. l would train the girl child who would grow up to address the issues of contraception and control population growth.”
