Anambra State government has disclosed its plans to close down all mortuaries that were not certified in the state. Commissioner for Health Dr. Joe Akabuike stated this in Awka at the weekend during a press briefing. He attributed the causes of certain deaths to diseases from corpses, adding that those contaminated with infectious virus and bacteria could infect morticians if not properly taken care of. “One of the roots through which diseases can spread is through corpses as any persons that died was killed by some diseases,” he said. He revealed that government had undertaken training of  morticians on best practices, ethical conducts and legal issues affecting their jobs. Akabuike advised morticians to maintain standard operation procedures, including wearing of protective aprons  while discharging their duties. He further condemned the practice of establishing mortuaries in authorized places in the state by persons believed to be foreigners. The commissioner also inaugurated the Association of Morticians, the first of its kind in Nigeria, urging every mortician in the state to register with the association.
