A week ahead of the elections which would decide whether Banky Wellington, popularly known as Banky W, would represent his Eti Osa constituency at the Federal House of Representatives, the singer has shown he is not leaving anything to chance. In a video which he posted on Instagram on Thursday, the musician, actor and record producer who is contesting under the platform of Modern Democratic Party (MDP) said that the people do not know the lawmaker that represents them. Speaking in pidgin, “If person tell you say he wan represent you, the thin be say, all the people wey sidon like 3000, I say abeg how many people among these 3000 know who our representatives be for the House of Rep? Na who be your Rep? Na only five people raise up their hands. “We no even fit say oga wetin you do? Because we no even know who the person be. As we dey talk about House of Representative; they get two main job. On the national level for the country and, na the people wey suppose they write the law, wey dey govern the society wey everybody suppose abide by.” The musician, who has the backing of his wife, had made it known that if he is elected, he will direct his main focus to the youths.
