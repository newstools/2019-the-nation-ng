Lagos Police Commissioner Zubairu Muazu on Thursday explained the ‘free Lagos’ campaign at Ikeja Airport Hotel was disrupted because the organisers did not notify the police about the gathering and were faceless. Organisers of the rally, Orange Movement, had alleged that policemen deployed to the venue had tear-gassed them, alleging they were hoodlums. Among the conveners of the event were former President, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olisa Agbakoba (SAN); Spokesperson Afenifere Group Yinka Odumakin and Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, who were yet to arrive the venue at the time of the incident. While some participants had already seated inside Oranmiyan Hall where the event was to hold, it was gathered that others were stopped by a detachment of armed policemen mobilised to the scene from entering the hall. In the ensuing drama, the policemen fired several shots to disperse the crowd with people running helter-skelter within the premises. At a briefing with reporters on Thursday evening, Muazu confirmed he ordered dispersal of the group. According to Muazu, the command had to take proactive measures to prevent an accident similar to the spontaneous celebration by hoodlums at Okokomaiko on Wednesday that resulted to violence. He said that although citizens have right to organise peaceful protest, they are to notify the police in writing, adding that the Public Order Act was still being enforced. The police chief said information was received a rally the police were not informed of, adding that following Wednesday”s incident, he prevented a possible breakdown of law and order by hoodlums. He said: “It is against the law for anyone or group of persons to organize any public procession without getting approval from the police considering the tense situation in the state.”
