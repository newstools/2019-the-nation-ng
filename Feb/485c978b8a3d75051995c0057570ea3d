The 164th Madrid derby between fierce city rivals, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, taking place at the Wanda Metropolitano today will be broadcast live on GOtv. The La Liga encounter, which will be broadcast on SuperSport Select 4 (channel 34) at 4:15 pm, is exclusive to GOtv MAX subscribers. The two giants are meeting for the second time this season. The first encounter at Real’s Santiago Bernabéu in September ended goalless. Two points separate the teams, with Atletico occupying the second position on the La Liga standings with 44 points, while Real are third with 42 points. Real could, however, leapfrog their neighbors should they win and put themselves five points behind leaders, Barcelona, with whom they played a 1-1 draw on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey semi-final. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has hit form right in time for the Los Blancos, as they won their last five games in all competitions before Wednesday’s draw.
