Biking enthusiast, Korede Balogun, alias BKleff, has taken his campaign to boost voter awareness to the streets, ahead of the forthcoming elections. Balogun, the managing director of BKleff Entertainment, said the aim was to mobilise as many Nigerians as possible to register for, obtain their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and exercise their civic rights. The event’s theme, he said, is: “Power of PVC ride”, adding that the project would continue throughout the electioneering period. Explaining the reason for the project, Balogun said: “What we have decided to do is to ride for the nation. I am a biker and I organise events and programmes. “Last year, I came up with ‘Power of PVC ride’, which involves mobilising bikers to ride for the nation. What we intend to do, which we have started, is Permanent Voter Card (PVC) registration, giving people the reasons why they need to get registered. We have realised that people are not picking up their PVCs.” He said although it was a self-funded project, he had secured the partnership of the Police and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), among other stakeholders. Balogun said the process involved attracting residents of a street or an area with bike rides. “Onlookers will be entertained by actors, who will simulate a live electoral process involving voters, INEC officials, observers, journalists, the police and a mobile court to sanction electoral offenders. “We started at Ikeja Local Government. We have been to Yaba, Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State, Iyana-Ipaja and Oshodi. We were at Obalende last Tuesday, Ketu last Wednesday and many other places,” he added.
