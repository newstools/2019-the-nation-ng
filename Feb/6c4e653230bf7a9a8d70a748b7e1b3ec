Agusto & Co Limited,  Pan African credit rating agency has assigned a “Bb” rating to the Insurance Industry in its newly published 2019 Nigerian Insurance Industry report. The assigned rating reflects heightened risks in the country’s geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, weak gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflationary pressures. In addition, dwindling crude oil prices and a contractionary monetary policy stance aimed at forestalling speculative activities on the naira both impact the assigned rating. Agusto & Co’s rating takes into cognisance the size and strategic importance of the Insurance Industry in Nigeria. Though relatively small, with a Gross Premium Income as a percentage of GDP at 0.4 per cent, the Industry’s economic importance is noteworthy. The Agency highlights the primary responsibility of insurers in supporting businesses and individuals recover from unexpected losses promptly, through claims payments. The Insurance Industry promotes economic growth by mobilising domestic savings most of which is used to fund the budget deficit through investments in treasury bills. According to an insurance analyst at the rating agency, there has been an influx of foreign direct investments (FDIs) over the last two years which has resulted in changes in the Industry’s shareholding structure.
