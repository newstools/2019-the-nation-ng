Signed on to Half Music Monks, a South African record label he founded, Jerry Pay released his first single, ‘Unfinished.’ “‘Unfinished’ is a song full of messages, and motivation. I got this inspiration when I was striving all alone traveling different countries for greener pasture facing financial challenges moving from a wall to another. I decided to make the title “Unfinished” because it’s a new beginning of good things in my journey and I can’t see it coming to an end any moment soon. No money, no life, no money, no conversation. The street and my fans love my first single ‘Unfinished’ and they are demanding for more.
