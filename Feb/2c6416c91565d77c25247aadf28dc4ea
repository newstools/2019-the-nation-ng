A 27-year-old tailor, Toheeb Rasaq, who allegedly punched his landlord and hit him with a chair, yesterday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant is facing a three-count charge of breach of the peace, assault and causing grievous harm.  He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti said the defendant committed the offence on November 4, last year, at his residence. He alleged that the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by assaulting the complainant, Mr. Theophilus Afolayan. “The defendant assaulted the complainant with a chair, which caused grievous harm to his left eye,” Koti added. He said the complainant tried to settle a fight between the defendant and his wives. “The defendant turned to the complainant and punched him several times on the face. “He was not satisfied with the punches, he then used a chair and hit him on his eye,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola granted the defendant N80,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on February 18.
