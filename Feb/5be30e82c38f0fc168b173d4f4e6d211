A 28-year-old unemployed man, Taiwo Ogunmodede, who allegedly broke into a real estate firm and stole N1.6 million, yesterday appeared at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said the defendant on October 24 last year at 2am broke into a real estate firm at Mile II Estate in Lagos, belonging to Mr. Babatunde Shittu. Olaluwoye alleged that the defendant stole an Infinix Note 5 phone valued at N102, 000 and N1.6 million locked in the complainant’s office desk. She said: “My Lord, a neighbour saw the defendant running away from office at 2am and called the attention of the guard. “When the guard went to check the office, he noticed that it had been broken into and he reported the matter at a police station.” The accused pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendant N500, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 15.
