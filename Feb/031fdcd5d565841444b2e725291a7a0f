Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday gave N10million to People Living with Disabilities (PLWDs). He also distributed devices to 1,000 PLWDs and promised to always protect the rights of the physically challenged. At the event held at the Blue Roof, Lagos Television Ground, Ikeja, the governor said the Lagos State Office of Disabilities Affairs (LASODA) had instituted policies, plans and programmes that would guarantee equal rights and opportunities for PLWDs. Ambode, represented by the Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Agboola Dabiri, said as a responsible government, the N500 million Disability Trust Fund was created to assist persons living with disabilities. He said the implementation of the fund was geared towards the advancement of the cause of PLWDs, adding that individuals, corporate organisations, government institutions, among others could contribute to the fund as a way of jointly ameliorating the challenges facing the physically challenged. The governor said the devices and grants would take PLWDs off the streets, them productive to fit into societal life. The governorâ€™s Special Adviser on Social Development, Joyce Onafowokan, stressed the need for early support for children with disabilities, adding that any delay in such area could lead to environmental risk such as drug abuse and lack of proper pre-natal care. LASODA General Manager Dr. Babatunde Awelenje said the fund would cater for the needs of PLWDs.
