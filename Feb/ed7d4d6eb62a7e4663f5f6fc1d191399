To garner enough global points before end of March was of the reasons, United States’ Sohwon Kim has decided to be part of the maiden Nigeria Taekwondo International Open. Kim, whose last tournament was in November 2018 at the Israel Open, believes his coming to Nigeria would improve his chance of making the American team to the World Championship in England later in the year. “I have been enjoying myself since arriving Nigeria although it is a different culture compared to where I am coming from. I hope I can win gold to be able to garner enough points to secure my place in the US team for the World Championships. But I must also say that winning gold in Nigeria depends solely on my feeling on court and I hope I can have good feeling go into my fights,” the 2016 World Team Championships bronze medalist said. Kim who made his first Junior National team alongside his brother in 2012, after starting taekwondo in 2001, has commended the organisers of the Nigeria Open for their reception on his arrival in Abuja. “I think I had a smooth ride from my base and I am so excited that I was well received at the airport by the organisers, which for me was a sign of god thing to come in the competition. I hope I will enjoy every day I spend in Nigeria to be able to want to come back again, “ the 2016 Canada Open bronze medalist added. Kim is expected to compete in the men’s -68kg alongside athletes from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Niger Republic, Togo and Cote d’Ivoire.
