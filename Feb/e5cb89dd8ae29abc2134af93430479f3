Two bus conductors, Peter Ayodele, 20, and Chibuzor David, 21, were yesterday arraigned at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing three pants  belonging to a housewife. Ayodele pleaded guilty; David pleaded not guilty. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola ordered that Ayodele be remanded in Kirikiri Prisons, pending the review of the facts of the case and sentencing. David was granted N80, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti said the accused on February 6, at Idi-Oro, Mushin, stole the pants of Mrs. Kehinde Oladimeji, with intent to use them for rituals. “The defendants unlawfully entered the complainant’s house at night while she was sleeping and stole three of her pants. “But luck ran against them, as they were caught by a team of policemen on patrol. “When they were asked their mission at that time of the night, they could not give a satisfactory answer. Consequently, they were searched and three female pants were found on them. “Ayodele told the police where they stole the pants from and when the scene of the theft was visited by the police, the complainant confirmed that the pants were her own,” the prosecutor said. The case continues on  March 4.
