Former Super Eagles’ striker Osaze Odemwingie has explained how he received treatment from a voodoo man year’s back when he was injured while playing football. Osaze Odemwingie was born in Russia but was brought to Nigeria by his parents before he began his professional football career at Bendel Insurance of Benin. The 37-year-old who currently plays in Indonesia, has now revealed how he got injured in training before he was taken to a place for ‘juju’ treatment on his shoulder. ”I had a fall in training, I also hurt my shoulder and broke my arm. I was afraid to tell my mom so they took me to the local juju man. ”They poured hot water to relax their muscles. Somehow they returned the hand to the place, while I yelled, they twisted some small sticks. There was a rite with a chicken. ”I came home, my mother saw the hand: “Broke?” I answered: “Yes.” I was taken to a regular hospital, anaesthesia was done, and they put the plaster on. All is well in the end,” Odemwingie told championat.com. Odemwingie who was known for his superb skills while playing for the Super Eagles added that most African players believe in juju treatment (voodoo) than going to see doctors when injured. ” ”At least 70% of players believe in it. They think that some kind of salve will save them. This is more suggestion. Brainwashing goes. ”But three years in Nigeria have been helpful to me. They called me to the Big League, and there my career developed much faster,” he added.
