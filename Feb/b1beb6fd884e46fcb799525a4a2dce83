An Islamic cleric Abdul-Lateef Mustapha, 38, has been arrested by the police in Lagos for alleged defilement of his wife’s nine-year-old niece (names withheld). The man was apprehended by members of the Child Protection Network (CPN) in Somolu and handed over to the Bariga Police Station on Sunday morning after he was allegedly caught the previous day. It was gathered that the child had earlier complained neighbours that she was being sexually molested by her aunt’s husband but they did not believe her until neighbours caught him in the act on Saturday. The suspect who claimed it was the first time he was doing it and apologized was challenged by the victim who said he had raped her more than three times. A source who told our Correspondent about the incident said relatives of the suspect wanted to cover it up but his wife and two others quickly alerted the CPN unit in Somolu. “The family wanted to fight the wife. They wanted the matter to die down. They were threatening the girl and also cursing. They also wanted to attack an activist who invited the police,” the source said. Confirming the incident, head of CPN in Somolu Toyin Okanlawon said the victim has been taken to the Mirable Centre for examination. He said: “The family all bombarded the station in Hijab and Jalamia dress pleading that the Alfa be released. As it stands now, the victim is not safe in that house. She and her aunt slept at the station for their safety following the reaction of the man’s relatives. “We have appealed to the Juvenile Centre at Alakara in Mushin to provide shelter for the victim. She was brought from Kano last January by her aunt so that she could be looked after properly but the woman’s husband turned a predator. “I specially commend the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Bariga because he provided food for the victim and her aunt when he realised they have not eaten. He also calmed the girl down because she was tearful and traumatized.”
