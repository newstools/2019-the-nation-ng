KANO State has condemned what it described as the attacks meted out on innocent residents of the state capital by alleged elements of Kwankwasiyya group during the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential rally yesterday at Sani Abacha Stadium, Kofar Mata. A statement issued by the Commissioner for Information, Youth and Culture Malam Muhammad Garba said the group members, who were allegedly disturbed by the dislodgement of their leader, Rabi’u Kwankwaso in Kano’s political scene, adopted violence to vent their anger over the success of the APC at all level. The commissioner noted that while the APC government gave a level-playing field for the opposition and committed to peaceful electioneering campaign, “it is really unfortunate that the group do not want the peaceful political atmosphere that has been entrenched by the present government in the state”. “We observe with concern the use of violence by the disenchanted group, particularly now that elections at various levels are just around the corner.  This is a deliberate plot by Kwankwasiyya group to instill fear in the minds of residents to discourage them from exercising their franchise”, the statement added. Garba added that alleged “unguarded utterances by the leadership of the group is driving the thugs within its rank to intemperate fear on residents in some parts of the metropolis by smashing vehicles, assaulting and grabbing mobile phones from unsuspecting members of the public”. The statement urged security agents to be alive to their responsibilities by ensuring that the culprits were brought to book to serve as a deterrent to others, particularly considering that peace accord has been signed by the  candidates in the forthcoming governorship election in the state.
