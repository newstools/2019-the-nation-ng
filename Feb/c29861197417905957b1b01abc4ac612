 Flying Eagles of Nigeria Wednesday in Niamey failed to make it to the finals of the 2019 Under 20 AFCON, losing on penalty 4-3 to Eagles of Mali in the semifinals. The Paul Aigbogun tutored side had ample chances of sealing the game within regulation time but failed to convert. Their Malian counterparts were not even better coupled with the fact that the pitch was bumpy and unfriendly. The match had ended 1-1 at regulation time and also at the end of extra time thus leading to penalty shoots out.  While the Flying Eagles were only able to convert three of their kicks in the battle of Eagles, the Eagles of mail converted four of theirs to zoom into Sunday’s final. The defeat put an end to Nigeria’s desire to clinch the title for the 8th time after winning a record seven times in the past. Aigbogun and his boys will now look forward to the third place match on Saturday.  Interestingly the team has already picked one of the tickets to the world cup in Poland, as the four semifinalists will all flag Africa’s flag at the world cup
