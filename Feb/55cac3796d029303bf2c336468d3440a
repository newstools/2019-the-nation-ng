The All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Gubernatorial Candidate in Nasarawa State, Mr Labaran Maku said he would revive the state’s cultural festivals that had been abandoned by previous administrations if elected. Maku, a former deputy governor of the state, made the promise when he hosted Mr Aliyu Doma, the Gubernatorial Candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) at his Akwanga residence on Wednesday. According to him, the state that has multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and cross-cultural heritage should have a platform that can unite its people. The ex-deputy governor said he planned to place premium on reviving cultural festivals because culture had the power to unite people irrespective of tribal and religious affiliations. He expressed regrets that the current All Progressive Congress (APC) administration in the state had failed to sustain the achievements of late Gov. Akwe Doma, who promoted and sustained cultural festivals of Nasarawa people. “I think Nasarawa State, which is home to many Nigerian tribes including the Hausas, Fulanis, Kanuris, as well as others that transcend beyond the north, should be called the rainbow state. “I will revive the cultural festivals in the state; rename Nasarawa Rainbow State because it is a multilingual, multicultural and multiethnic state,’’ Maku said.
