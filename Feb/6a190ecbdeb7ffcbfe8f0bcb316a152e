 Former Super Eagles forward Shola Ameobi is not likely to turn down any coaching opportunity if it comes his way. Indicators to this effect emerged Wednesday when the former Newcastle legend identified what he believes is responsible for the dwindling fortune of Arsenal, submitting that playing Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as Centre-forward will help the Gunners halt their recent poor form. Ameobi who last played for league two side Notts County, stopped short of telling current Arsenal coach Unai Emery how to go about his job, opined that operating from the wings is not the best for Aubameyang. The 37 year old believes the best can only come from the former Borussia Dortmund if he is drafted as centre-forward. “It’s gonna be very hard for Aubameyang because he’s a number nine,” Ameobi said on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Football Daily podcast “He wants to be on the end like Aguero and when he’s pushed to the side, pushed to the wing, I don’t think he’s as comfortable out there as maybe [Alexandre] Lacazette. “So it’s very hard for Arsenal to maintain any type of pressure when you’re playing a certain number nine out on the wing.” The Gunners have lost three of their last five games, including Sunday’s 3-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium which saw them drop off the top-five spot. The Gabon international has failed to make significant impact from the wings this season under manager Unai Emery, scoring three of his 18 goals from the position. Both Aubameyang and Nigerian international Alex Iwobi who was scored low in the loss to Manchester city, will hope to get their side back to winning ways when they travel to the John Smith’s Stadium to take on Huddersfield Town on Saturday. Ameobi who made Super Eagles 23-man squad to the 2014 World cup in Brazil a total of 10 appearances for the national team, scoring twice in friendly matches against Burkina Faso and Italy respectively
