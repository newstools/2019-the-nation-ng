The Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi 11 has expressed dismay over the recent political upheavals and unrest that led to several bloody attacks on innocent residents by hoodlums in the state. Addressing reporters at his Palace on Tuesday, Sanusi called on security agencies to live up to their responsibilities in curbing the ugly trend. According to him, the resurgence of political thuggery calls for immediate concerns in the state. The Emir said the state is not at war, stating: “We should not rise on to each other’s throats in the name of politics. “We should avoid shedding the blood of innocent citizens and wanton destructions of lives and properties.” The monarch however urged politicians to play the game by its rules to prevent miscreants from taking advantage to wreak havoc on innocent lives. “All I want is for the people to live in peace and harmony and to also vote credible leaders that will have the love of the people at the back of their minds. “I urged the security agencies in the state to also brace up and discharged their statutory responsibilities without any fear or favour for peace to continue to reign in the state as well as ensure peaceful conduct of the forthcoming general elections in the country,” he stressed. The Emir also called on political party leaders in the state to prevail on their supporters on the inherent dangers of taking the law into their hands. He appealed to traditional and religious leaders in the state to embark on the massive mobilisation of the teeming youths in their domains to abhor violence and thuggery for the progress and development of the state.
