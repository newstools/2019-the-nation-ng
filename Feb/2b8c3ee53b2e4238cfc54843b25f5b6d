Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos State Command has inaugurated a new body of Special Marshals at the Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal Two (MMA2), Lagos. Spokesman of Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL) Tunde Osowe said the inauguration was hinged on the long-standing relationship between FRSC and the management of BASL, operators of the MMA2. The Special Marshals unit, according to him, will be saddled with administering road safety standards and other relevant measures aimed at ensuring orderliness not only around the aiport, but also in various parts of the country. The partnership, he said, was part of BASL’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives to ensure safety of lives and property. BASL’s Group Executive Director (GED) Mr Rodger Whittle said the task of establishing and maintaining a safe and secure environment demands  collective responsibility. He said the challenges on road network were enormous requiring a lot of support beyond the operations of regular marshals of the FRSC. He said this informed the establishment of the Special Marshal unit. Whittle said: “We have professionals of diverse fields and capacities across the BASL company who have volunteered and are committed to be part of this commission; in order to contribute meaningfully to safety of lives and property.’’
