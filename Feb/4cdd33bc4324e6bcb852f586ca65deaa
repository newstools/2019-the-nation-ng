Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Kano Central Senatorial seat, has advised youths against violence during the upcoming election in the state. He gave the advice while interacting with newsmen in Kano on Wednesday. Shekarau, a former governor of Kano state, said the advice was necessary in view of the resurgence of political thuggery in the state. According to him, the recent happenings in the metropolis is very unfortunate and should be condemned by all well-meaning Nigerians who want the country’s democracy to thrive. The former Minister of Education, accused some politicians of instigating their supporters to cause trouble for selfish interest. “I condemn in totality the political thuggery because what happened recently in Kano metropolis is most unfortunate,” Shekarau said. He called on politicians to warn their followers against engaging in acts capable of breaching peace in the state. “How can somebody who is looking for support and votes from electorate direct youths to attack his opponents. It is most unfortunate. “We have been warning our followers not to participate or go and do anything that will lead to violence before, during and after the election,”he said. He said if elected as Senator, he would join his colleagues at the National Assembly to see how they could address the challenges of primary, secondary and tertiary health institutions in the state. On his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari, the Senatorial candidate said his relationship with the President was very cordial. He, therefore, urged supporters to come out massively and vote for Buhari and other APC candidates during the general election. NAN
