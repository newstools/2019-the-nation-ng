Nigeria international defender Kenneth Omeruo says the Super Eagles can win the 2019 AFCON set to take place in Egypt this summer. Omeruo has 41 caps to his name and was part of the Nigeria squad that lifted the 2013 AFCON title in South Africa. He also represented the Super Eagles in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The 25-year-old joined Chelsea in 2012 coming from Belgium’s Standard de Liege. Even after winning the U-21 Premier League he wasn’t able to cement his place in the first team. He joined his fair share of European clubs, on loan, including, Middlesborough, Kasimpasa and finally Leganes. Omeruo stated that Nigeria has a very young and talented squad and is able to win the tournament. “I think we have what it takes to win the AFCON. We have a good team, a young team,” Omeruo told Footballlive.ng. “We can get to the final and even win the tournament. It is just that, we will take every game as it comes with the seriousness it deserves.” Nigeria secured its place in the upcoming AFCON as they sit first in their group with 10 points and one game to spare. Their final game will be against Seychelles.
