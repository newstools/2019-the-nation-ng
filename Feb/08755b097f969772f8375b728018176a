The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) has commenced the deployment of sensitive electoral materials to the 31 local governments in Akwa Ibom State. Akwa Ibom Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Mike Igini, who disclosed this while addressing to party agents, international observers and security agencies said the commission will everything within its power to conduct a hitch-free exercise. Igini said: “We have commenced the continuation of what we have been doing in the last few days in preparation of our re-scheduled elections. What you are seeing here is what is left of the materials for the conduct of the rescheduled elections.” He regretted that the commission could not move all the materials as at last Friday, February 15.
