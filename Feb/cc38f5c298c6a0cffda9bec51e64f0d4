A 23-year-old unemployed man, John Chimobi, who allegedly trespassed into a mechanic workshop and vandalised three cars at gunpoint, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. Chimobi, who lives at 10, Agbole Street, Igando, Lagos, is being tried for unlawful possession of weapons and robbery. The accused pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada alleged that Chimobi, with others at large, invaded a mechanic workshop with guns and other weapons and vandalised three cars worth N5 million last December 14, at 54, Brown Street, Aguda, Lagos. He said Chimobi and his accomplices trespassed into the compound with an intent to steal. “Chimobi vandalised one Toyota Prado, one Toyota Sienna and one Toyota Camry at gunpoint.”
