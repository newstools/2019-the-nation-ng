 Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has signed a four-year contract with Juventus worth over £400,000 per week, according to Sky sources. The Wales international has agreed a pre-contract deal with the Italian champions, meaning he will join on a free transfer when his Arsenal deal expires at the end of the season. Ramsey had been in talks with the Gunners over a new deal for several months, but the club withdrew their offer in October, leaving Ramsey free to discuss a move away from north London. The former Cardiff ace who joined Arsenal in 2008 has so far made 256 appearances scoring 38 goals. Former Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenge once described Ramsey as a “complete midfielder” adding  “I was a midfielder, and I would have loved to have had what he has. He can defend, he can attack, he can score goals. What more do you want?” Ramsey was rewarded for his outstanding form during the 2013–14 season by being named Arsenal’s Player of the Season. It was in the same season that he developed into one of the most influential players at the Emirates In the last 13 months, Arsenal have signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Bernd Leno, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Lucas Torreira for a combined total of over £100m, but only signed Denis Suarez on loan from Barcelona in January. Mesut Ozil was also handed a new long-term contract last season worth £350,000 per week. Juventus are considered to be experts at exploiting the free transfer market, and have signed the likes of Dani Alves, Emre Can, Andrea Pirlo and Paul Pogba on pre-contract deals in recent years. Ramsey will become the third Welshman to play for Juve, following in the footsteps of Ian Rush – who spent just one season in Italy – and John Charles, who spent five years with the club in the 1950s and 60s.
