 The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has condemned the bloody violence that claimed the lives of innocent Nigerians during Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in the country, restating that no one deserves to die over a process to elect their leaders. Reacting to the reports of pockets of violence in some parts of the country, the PDP presidential candidate reiterated his earlier position that no politician’s ambition is worth the blood of any innocent Nigerian. According to him, no politician should celebrate his political gains if they are written in the blood of innocent Nigerians, and that no Nigerian, including innocent youth corps members, deserve to die for the sake of any man’s political ambition. He said those innocent Nigerians that died won’t be forgotten for their sacrifices, adding that political violence, which is being aided and abetted by desperate politicians, is giving the country’s democracy a bad name. In a statement Sunday by his media Adviser, Mr Paul Ibe, the PDP flag bearer said, “Those politicians who climb the ladder of human lives to attain power have brought our democracy into disrepute, and that it was high time the Nigerian youth opened their eyes to resist being used to kill and maim. “Any politician who is sincerely interested in the progress of the youth shouldn’t be using them as cannon fodder for his/her ambition. The youth deserve jobs and not death. “The real enemies worth fighting are poverty, unemployment, hunger, nepotism, division, despair and uncertain future”. He expressed sadness over the death of some Nigerians during the elections and expressed his condolences to the families and friends of those innocent Nigerians that tragically lost their lives.
