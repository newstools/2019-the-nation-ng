With the relaxation of the ban on campaign till Thursday, the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, has resumed campaigning in major markets across Anambra State. Obi yesterday visited major markets in Onitsha – Electronics market, Ogbo Afere, Relief Market, Ogbaru Main Market. At each of the markets, Obi explained to the people the imperatives of the Atiku’s Presidency as what Nigeria needs now to get the country working again. Obi, who lamented the level of decay in the country in terms of infrastructure, absence of employment for the youth, lawlessness and recklessness in high places, mounting foreign and local debt, biting tax regime, incompetence, among others, said any further  tolerance of the present state of affairs would see the country collapse. Counting the number of generators in one of the markets, Obi asked rhetorically: “How long will our economy be powered by generators?” He promised that Abubakar Atiku, having come out with detailed work plan, would place the country on track again to continue her truncated democratic and economic development.
