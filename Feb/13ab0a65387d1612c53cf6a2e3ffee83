The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have allocated 774 election observer slots to the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS). National President of NCWS, Dr Gloria Shoda said that the group has been advocating for inclusiveness and are pleased with INEC’s legal frameworks. She said that they are also pleased with INEC’s reforms of creating separate queues for expectant mothers and elderly women during the election. Dr Shoda stated this at the first NCWS quarter zonal national executive council meeting that took place in Abuja. Her words, “One of the important aspects of elections which we have been advocating for sometimes is inclusiveness. We are pleased to see that the nation’s electoral management body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has made provisions through legal frameworks for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) and Intemally-Displaced Persons (lDPs). “We note too that there will be separate queues for expectant mothers and our elderly citizens. We encourage all people who belong to these categories to take advantage of the provisions made by lNEC to ensure they exercise their right to vote. “We also urge INEC continue in its bid to ensure a free, fair and credible elections and abide by its guidelines and regulation which it released in January 2019. The introduction of technology into the electoral process is to reduce the opportunities for fraudulent practices. “I will also like to caution our NCWS election observers to take care of hemselves. Please think safety first and do not interfere in the process even if you see anything going wrong. Your role is to quietly observe the process for making a report later; please don’t use your phone to record or take photographs when the atmosphere is tense. Finally, please do not take any unnecessary risks, your family and loved ones are waiting to see you back at home.”
