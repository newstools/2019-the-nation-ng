It began as a small circle of party chiefs and some curious residents. In a few minutes, it became a sea of heads, which burst into songs and slogans. A carnival. That was Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s visit yesterday to Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The reception was tumultous. Residents and All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters were shouting the party’s battle-cry, O to gee (enough is enough) Prof. Osinbajo was drawing the curtain on his Next Level engagements for support for the party in tomorrow’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. He was first received by the Information and Culture & Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed, Kwara APC governorship candidate AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and other party chieftains. Continuing his campaign for the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari, Osinbajo stopped over at the palace of the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Kolapo Sulu-Gambari. The monarch personally received him in front of the palace amidst chants of ‘Osinbajo’, ‘Sai Baba’ and ‘O to ge’ (Kwara APC’s campaign slogan). At the palace, Prof Osinbajo listeded the major achievements of the Buhari administration and why APC is seeking re-election. The vice president proceeded to take long walks on the streets of Ilorin through Adabata, Isale Aluko and Alanamu ward, where he was greeted by huge crowds of residents who trooped out to welcome him. Prof. Osinbajo assured Kwara residents that more Federal Government impact will be felt over the next four years as the country goes to the Next Level. He said President Buhari’s government is committed to creating more jobs and improving the country’s economy. He also stated that more Nigerians will benefit from its Social Investment Programmes (SIPs) which has positively affected the lives of millions of Nigerians.
