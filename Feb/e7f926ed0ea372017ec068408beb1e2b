A group, Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard, made up of social activists, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), artisans, political groups and youths, has described wife of Lagos State Governor, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode as a humble, detribalised Nigerian. Coordinator of the group, Mr. Bamigbade Seyi, in a felicitation message on her 55th birthday commended Mrs. Ambode for being a strong pillar for her husband. He pointed out her support to the governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, has manifested in the giant strides recorded across all sectors in the state in the last three and half years. He said as a humble and compassionate mother who combines decency and commitment to excellence in personal and public life, she has been able to warm her way into the hearts of residents. Bamigbade also described Mrs. Ambode as a role model and shining star in the state’s political firmament. “Mrs. Bolanle Ambode is a detribalised Nigerian who has traversed the length and breadth of the state, helping less privileged people, seeking the emancipation of women and the youths for an egalitarian society through her pet project, Hope for Women in Nigeria Initiative, HOFOWEM. “Her undying love for the downtrodden, the deprived and the ordinary folks across the state is widely acknowledged, while her unflinching backing for Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration has helped tremendously in the fulfillment of its electioneering promises to Lagosians,” he said. Bamigbade said special prayer will be organised for her. “As you are savouring the joy of this occasion, it is our prayer that God Almighty strengthens you so that you can continue with you good character for the betterment of your fatherland,” the felicitation added.
