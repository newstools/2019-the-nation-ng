The Senate Monday ordered the discontinuation of the case it filed at the Supreme Court on the suspension of Justice Walter Nkanu Onnoghen. The upper chamber said that its decision to discontinue the case followed the intervention of the National Judicial Council (NJC) on the issue. A statement by the Special Adviser to the Senate President on media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the Senate announced that it has decided to give the NJC intervention a chance. “The Senate has therefore decided to discontinue the case it filed in the Supreme Court. It should be noted that the case has been slated for hearing tomorrow. This decision also affirms the confidence of the Senate in the ability of the NJC to successfully and creditably resolve the issues,” the statement stated. The Senate has gone to the Supreme Court to challenge the legality of the suspension of Justice Onnoghen. It specifically asked the apex court to consider whether the suspension of Onnoghen without recourse to the Senate does not amount to the usurpation of the powers of the upper chamber.
