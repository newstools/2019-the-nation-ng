Deputy Chief Whip of the Senate representing Edo North, Senator Francis Alimikhena, has cautioned voters in his constituency not to believe the lies perpetuated by opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Senator Alimikhena said the PDP was trying to survive by spreading lies through propaganda machinery across the country. Speaking at a campaign rally at Ebelle and other communities, Senator Alimikhena, who is the APC candidate for Edo North,  said he has suffocated the PDP in Edo North with  his achievements. Senator Alimikhena berated his PDP opponent Engineer Abubaker Momoh for spreading lies and making promises that could not be fulfilled. According to him, “Individuals don’t build secondary school but government. PDP do not have any substance to campaign only lies. Do not listen to his lies because he does not have the capacity to establish Secondary School. “Government schools are built and own by government not individuals. I have discuss the need to established a secondary school in Ebelle community with the Governor of Edo State and it will be done but you must prove by your vote that you need the school by voting for all the APC candidates from up to bottom. “Development is spread according to votes and support during an election. Your vote is an investment for the development of your community.  Therefore if you want this Community to be transformed do not vote for PDP.  It is only when you vote for APC that development will come here. We will not only establish secondary school but also construct the Okpekpe road to Okpella.”
