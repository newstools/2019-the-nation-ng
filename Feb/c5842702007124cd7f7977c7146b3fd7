The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has vowed to reopen its campaigns any moment from now. The party said its position is hinged on provisions of the Electoral Act. A statement on Sunday night by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the decision to reopen the campaign was consequent upon the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly elections from February 16 to February 23. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had barred parties from reopening their campaigns upon the shift in election date. The Electoral Act allows campaign up to 24 hours to election date in any category of election. The party has rejected administrative prohibition of open campaigns issued by the electoral body after the postponement. “Such administrative pronouncement was erroneous, directly in conflict with the provision of the Electoral Act and is not backed by any other law in our country. “Our position is predicated on the clear provision of section 99 (1) of the Electoral Act which stipulated that ‘for the purposes of this Act, the period of campaigning in public by every political party shall commence 90 days before polling day and end 24 hours prior to that day. “The clear import of this provision, in the current situation, is that given the postponement of the election to February 23, 2019, the 24 hours requirement for closure of all public campaigning falls at midnight of February 21,” the statement added. The main opposition party reminded INEC that whenever its administrative pronouncement conflicts with the Electoral Act, such administrative pronouncement must bow before the law. It charged INEC to be appropriately guided while directing party members to await further directives ahead of its reopening of campaigns.
