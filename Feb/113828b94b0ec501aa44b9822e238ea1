The Police Special Fraud Unit (SFU) Tuesday arraigned an Ecobank Plc manager, Ifeanyichukwu Azike, for allegedly defrauding a customer of N411 million. Justice Ayokunle Faji of the Federal High Court in Lagos ordered his remand pending hearing of his bail motion. He was charged with three counts of obtaining money by false pretence, false representation and fraud. The prosecution said Azike, sometime in 2016 and 2017, with intent to defraud, obtained N150million from a customer, Mr. Okafor Ikenna Kelvin, whose account number is 533010936. The defendant allegedly claimed that he would purchase treasury bills for him, a claim he knew to be false. SFU said Azike forged a signature, a photograph, and a letter of instruction to open a parallel account in Kelvin’s name, numbered 5333063028, with intent that it may be used as genuine to the prejudice of Kelvin and the bank. In the third count, the prosecution said the defendant “did fraudulent convert to your use the sum of N411, 000,000, being money fraudulently withdrawn from your employer without their consent, and from a customer of your bank, to invest on behalf of the customer, which you failed to deliver, with aim of converting the illicit origin of the resources.” The alleged offence violates Section 1 (1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and punishable under Section 1 (3); Section 1 (2)(c) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act of 1999 (as amended), and Section 15 (1) 2) and 15 (2) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Justice Faji adjourned until March 8.
