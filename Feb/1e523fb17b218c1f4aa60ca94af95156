The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to arrest the Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State. The call was made in response to the governor’s threat to foreign election observers and members of the international community that they would be sent back to their countries in body bags if they get involved in the upcoming general elections. The governor had, during a live programme on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) on Tuesday, threatened that foreign election observers planning to interfere with the polls will leave in Nigeria in body bags. But speaking at the party’s presidential campaign rally in Makurdi, the Benue State capital on Friday, the PDP chairman, said that an Atiku Abubakar presidency would put an end to mindless killings in Benue and other states.
