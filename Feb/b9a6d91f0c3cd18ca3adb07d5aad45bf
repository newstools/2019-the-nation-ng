Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has ordered clampdown on all forms of extortions in the state. He directed security operatives to immediately stop all illegal tax collectors currently going on in the state, especially in Onitsha and its environs. Obiano, who gave the directive on Tuesday through his Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C Don Adinuba, asked the security agencies to step up efforts in protecting lives and property. He said: “My attention has been drawn to the activities of the new wave of robbers, who are dispossessing people of hard-earned money and other valuables. “Some criminal-minded elements, fake and illegal revenue collectors are making life unbearable for Ndi Anambra through fake and illegal revenue collections. “Innocent citizens are daily robbed in the city and the adjoining towns. You must do something to re-assure Ndi Anambra of their safety. “This is not tolerable. You must maintain all-day and night surveillance to nip robberies in the bud.” Obiano, who distanced his government from those persons he described as robbers, vowed not to give them second chance in the state. He added: “Those armed with sticks and cudgels are not appointed by Government to collect Internally Generated Revenue for Government (IGR). “These illegal collectors operate during the evenings, weeping people and acting in a manner that portrays them as self-serving mindless robbers. “We cannot afford to have the marauders back in our midst again.”
