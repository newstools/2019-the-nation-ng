THE Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) yesterday suspended its two-month-old strike after the Federal Government agreed to meet its demands. This is coming five days after the Academic Staff Union of Universities halted theirs. The government reached agreement with the union in the areas of revitalisation of polytechnic and colleges of education, review of the Polytechnic Act, payment of allowances and shortfalls and the renegotiation of the 2010 agreement. As a sign of good faith, the government released N16.8 billion to settle all outstanding arrears, which will be disbursed by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation. ASUP National President, Usman Dutse, stated these at a news conference yesterday in Abuja. He said the decision to suspend the strike, which had crippled activities at the nationâ€™s polytechnics, was taken at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting.
