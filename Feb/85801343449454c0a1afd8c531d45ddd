THE All Ports Unified Freight Forwarders Practitioners Association has commended the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col Hameed Ali (rtd) for calling for the reduction of duty and levy on imported used vehicles. It urged the government to put in place equal duty on all vehicles to discourage fairly used vehicles import. The Federal Government had put  35 per cent duty and levy on brand new cars, making importers to pay a total of 70 percent of the cost of a new car. The association’s President, Prince Mike Okorie, noted that equal duty and levy would discourage shippers from importing vehicles under the guise of importing tokunbo or fairly used ones. He said with this policy in place, importation of used vehicles would stop and Nigerians  be forced to buy new cars. Okorie added that Nigeria had become a dumping ground for used vehicles and that the government could only control this when it put in place policies that would discourage their importation. “Importers have devised a means of importing accidental vehicles into Nigeria and after that, put them in place and sell. It is a bad practice that must be discouraged. “I must commend the CG of Customs on this development, but we don’t have car-manufacturing companies in Nigeria. “Innoson Vehicles Manufacturing Company is the only firm that assembles cars, but how many cars can the company produce in a day?” he queried. He therefore called on the government to address the problem of vehicle manufacturing to stop the importation of fairly used ones. Okorie urged the Customs boss to address the issue of multiple check- points by officers and men of the NSC, saying the practice militates against trade facilitation.
