Justice Jude Dagat of the Federal High Court in Lagos, yesterday, sentenced a businessman, Ebenezer Arimiwem, to 15 months imprisonment for products counterfeiting. Arimiwem was charged by the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), with  manufacturing of cosmetic products without registration. The court held that it was satisfied that the prosecution had established its case beyond reasonable doubt, adding that the convict confessional statement  lents credence to the charge against him. According to the judge, the contention by the accused, who testified as defence witness 1 (Dw1) that his confessional statement was obtained under duress and dictated to him by prosecution, was an afterthought. The judge held that in his confessional statement, the convict admitted that he engaged in production of the cosmetics, and supplied same to women from Togo. The court held that his objection to the confessional statement did not hold water as the appropriate time to raise it was at the point of tendering it before the court, and not after it had been admitted in evidence. Dagat sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment on count one, 15 months on count two, 15 months on count three, 15 months on count four, 15 months on count five, 10 months on count six and 10 months on count seven. He gave him no fine option. The jail terms would run concurrently. The time the convict spent in custody would be counted for his jail term.
