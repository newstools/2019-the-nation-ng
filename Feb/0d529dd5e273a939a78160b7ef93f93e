No fewer than 14 persons died on Tuesday during a stampede at the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential rally in Port-Harcourt. Many others were injured in the sad incident, which occurred at the Adokiye Amiesimaka stadium near Port-Harcourt International Airport. Most of the injured were rushed to the nearby University of Port -Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH). The incident happened when the crowd surged toward the gate marked “Pedestrians only” shortly after President Buhari rounded off his speech around 3: 16pm. It was gathered policemen opened only one side of the big gate, causing a stampede as the crowd rushed to pass through. When our reporter got to the spot at 4:50 pm three aged women and a middle-aged man were seen lying dead. One of the revived survivors blamed overzealous policemen for the unfortunate incident, wondering why they didn’t open the two sides of the gate. Two ambulances from UPTH moved the injured persons and bodies to the federal teaching hospital. When contacted at 7:12 p.m., the Public Relations Officer of UPTH, Mr. Kem Daniel-Elebiga, confirmed that fourteen persons were brought to the hospital dead. He said three people were being attended to at the casualty unit with more persons rushed in. The Rivers Police Spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), also confirmed the incident. He stated Rivers Police Commissioner, Usman Belel, had ordered investigation into the stampede to know the immediate and remote causes, with anybody found culpable to be arrested and prosecuted. Mobile line of Rivers Commissioner for Health, Prof. Princewill Dike, was not available, as at press time.
