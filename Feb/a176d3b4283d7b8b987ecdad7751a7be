9mobile has won the Telecom Company of the Year 2018. The firm won the award at the LEADERHSIP Annual Conference and Awards which held yesterday at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja. The honour was conferred by Leadership Group Limited, publishers of Leadership Newspaper, in recognition of the telco’s resilience and stability in the face of challenges which the company pulled through over the last two years. Leadership Group Ltd Group Managing Director, Abdul Gombe, who presented the award, said the choice of 9mobile was a unanimous decision reached by an enlarged Board of Editors at a recent meeting. Gombe hailed 9mobile for emerging stronger from its many tests, including the challenging operating environment, tough regulatory requirements, threat of take-over by a banking consortium and post-acquisition realities. “In the face of all these, 9mobile has maintained its relevance and its 9ja brand heritage within the Nigerian telecommunication space. For your resilience, the selection board found you most suitable for this prestigious award,” he added. 9mobile Acting Managing Director Stephane Beuvelet, who received the award, praised Leadership for finding the telco worthy of the honour, saying it would motivate the board and management to continue building a world-class telecommunications company. He said: “On behalf of my other board members, we say thank you to Leadership Group Limited, for this award. Indeed, 2018 was a defining year for 9mobile, but we saw it as an opportunity to show our mettle and resilience. “Our thanks also goes to our stakeholders, our regulators who worked assiduously to ensure that the transition process was seamless; investors and financial partners that sustained the flow of critical lifeblood that we needed to stay afloat, and our customers who demonstrated loyalty and confidence in the brand.”
