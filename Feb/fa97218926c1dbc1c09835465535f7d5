Niger state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has said that the ballot papers were a bit confusing as a result of the number of political parties on the ballot. Just as he said that uninformed voters may be confused in selecting the party of their choice. Speaking after casting his vote, Bello advised the people to take their time and be patient to identify the party of their choice. “One thing I noticed while casting my vote is that the ballot paper is a bit confusing with so many parties on the ballot papers. So if you are not careful you may vote the wrong party of your choice. “So my advice is for the electorate to take their time, do not rush, be patient, go through the ballot paper carefully and identify the party of their choice”. The Governor who voted alongside his wife, Dr. Amina Sani-Bello expressed satisfaction on the large turnout of voters commending the electorates for their level of maturity, organization and calmness displayed at the polling center.
