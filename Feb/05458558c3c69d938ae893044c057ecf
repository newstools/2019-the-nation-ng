A house of Representatives member, James Abiodun Faleke, has promised to provide an alternative market for traders at Berger in Ojodu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State. Their market was demolished in April 2017 and since then they have not found another place. At a rally organised by the Association of Market Women and Men in Ojodu LCDA, Faleke, who represents Ikeja Federal Constituency, said he would prioritise the residents’ welfare. The traders endorsed All Progressives Congress’ (APC) candidates contesting in the area on the occasion. The rally was led by the Iyaloja General of Ojodu LCDA, Mrs. Folasade Salako. Faleke thanked the traders for supporting him and promised not to disappoint them, if re-elected. The lawmaker, however, advised the traders to desist from selling on the roads, because of its inherent danger. “Concerning the market at Berger, let us continue to pray. I want to assure you that God will provide a place for us to continue to use as an alternative place for the traders at Berger. As you have said, there are just two markets at Ojodu, one is gone. We must bring it back and God will help us. “Meanwhile, I want you all to go out and vote for President Muhammadu Buhari, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and other APC candidates, including my humble self and Damola Kasumu representing Ikeja Constituency II at the House of Assembly,” Faleke said. At the event were Kasumu, royal fathers, Iyaloja of Yakoyo, Alhaja Risikat Lawal and other Iyaloja and market leaders.
