A 43-year-old businessman, Pius Eke, who allegedly borrowed N900,000 from a leasing firm but failed to pay back, was on Monday charged with stealing at an Igbosere Magistratesâ€™ Court, Lagos. Eke, 43, is facing a three-count charge of stealing and issuance of dud cheques before Mrs A. A. Famobiwo. Prosecuting Inspector Steven Molo alleged that the defendant committed the offences between December 2016 and February 2017, at No. 20, Ogunlana Drive, Surulere, Lagos. He said Eke stole N900,000, belonging to Micro Leasing Ltd. Molo told the court that Eke obtained the said sum from the firm with a promise to pay back but did not do so. The court heard that following demands for repayment, Eke, on April 24, 2017 and May 24, 2017, issued two Skye Bank cheques of N69, 640 each to the firm. But both cheques were dishonoured when presented due to insufficient funds. The offences, according to Molo, violated sections 287, 321(b) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Eke pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Famobiwo granted him N100, 000 bail with one surety in the like sum, among other conditions. The case continues on February 26.
