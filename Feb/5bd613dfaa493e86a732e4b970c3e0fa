Wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha, has presented empowerment items to 1,250 women in the Federal Capital territory (FCT) to enable them to start their businesses. They also got N10,000 each. Mrs Buhari made the presentation at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The event was organised by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), in collaboration with the Future Assured, an initiative of Mrs Buhari and the Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA). Mrs Buhari said the gesture was aimed at complementing the government’s efforts in reducing poverty among women and youths. She advised the beneficiaries to make good use of the resources by engaging in profitable businesses. The beneficiaries received liquid soap as well as perfume-making tools for the smooth take-off of their small scale businesses. A beneficiary, Miss Marry Barnabas, praised the organisers for the gesture. Specifically, Barnabas thanked Mrs Buhari for giving her an opportunity to develop herself. She expressed optimism that the empowerment would enable her impact others’ lives. The beneficiaries were trained in various skills, including tailoring, cosmetology and culinary classes.
