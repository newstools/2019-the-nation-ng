Lagos State Government has urged youth development officers to be more efficient in their service delivery by engaging youths in useful activities. Youth and Social Development Commissioner Mr. Agboola Dabiri, who gave the advice yesterday at a youth centre in Onikan, Lagos, at a one-day management training for youth development officers, said he desired a situation where officers would be trained in how to effectively manage the facilities provided for youths. He said the training would also be beneficial in homes, “as many people do not know how to manage space. They keep items that are no longer useful, instead of giving them out to those who need them.” Dabiri added: “The government is renovating other youth centres such as the one at Akinwunmi Street, Alagomeji, Yaba; Sam Shonibare Street, Surulere; as well as Ikeja Youth Centre to make them more habitable.” He advised youths to maintain the facilities provided by the government, noting that “maintenance is the key to durability.” The Permanent Secretary, Dr. Sherifat Balogun, enjoined the officers to make use of the facility, “as this will enable them to be more efficient in managing the youth and the centres.”
