Lagos East Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Bayo Oshinowo, has expressed confidence in clinching victory at the polls. Speaking with newsmen shortly after casting his vote at Ogudu Junior Grammar School, Ogudu GRA, the lawmaker said he was optimistic of winning the senatorial seat for Lagos East. Fielding questions from journalists, he said, “The good lord who has made the weather bright and beautiful is enough evidence that we are going to win the race. The election was postponed last week. But the large turnout and peaceful conduct of the electorate show that democracy has come to stay. Everything is going to work in our favour, God willing.” Oshinowo, who was accredited around 10:40am, along with his wife, Maryam, cast his vote at 11:10am.
