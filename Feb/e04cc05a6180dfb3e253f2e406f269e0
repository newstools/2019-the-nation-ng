The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, on Wednesday urged Nigerians to use the forthcoming general elections to elect Godfearing and credible leaders for the country. Adams also urged all politicians contesting the elections to go to the polls with civility, saying that Nigerians’ attitudes matter in ensuring a peaceful election. He, however, expressed the believe that restructuring would be the best option for Nigeria as a nation. “We are in the crucial week as election is few days away. Elections will come and go, but the future of Nigeria is very important to us as a people. “One of the mistakes we do make as Nigerians is that we place much premium on who becomes the President without setting strong agenda for the future. “There should be agenda setting for the Nigerian future, and that is why this election is the key. “It is the duty of all eligible Nigerians to vote, and in doing that, I am appealing to everyone to bear in mind the overall interest of the country,” Adams said. He also urged political leaders and candidates, irrespective of their political parties and affiliations, to put Nigeria first before their personal ambitions. “For instance, in the build-up to the 2015 general elections, former President Goodluck Jonathan meant well for the nation. “When he said his personal ambition is not worth the blood of a Nigerian. As the president, he spearheaded an election, and eventually lost to the incumbent and heaven did not fall,” he said. Adams, however, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), not to disappoint Nigerians, saying that there should be enough security at the polling units. “There should be adequate election materials for Nigerians to vote, ” Adams said in a statement in Lagos.
