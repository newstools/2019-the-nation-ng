THE non-appearance of a lawyer for a former Wena Bank worker, Kazeem Olawuwo,  yesterday stalled his trial for alleged fraud at an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court. The police on January 3 charged Olawuwo, 37, and his female friend, Risikatu Wahab, 35, on a 12-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and stealing. At yesterday’s resumed hearing,  Magistrate T. A. Idowu noticed that the defendants had no lawyers. She ordered the defendants to ensure that they got lawyers before the next adjourned date of April 2. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh said the accused committed the offence sometime between October 2016 and April 2018, at Wema Bank Plc, Orile Iganmu branch, Lagos. He alleged that Olawuwo used his position to fraudulently transfer N2.4 million to different accounts. The prosecutor said the money was transferred in tranches from customers’ accounts to Olawuwo’s friends’ accounts. Wahab, he said, was one of Olawuwo’s friends who received the cash,  with the knowledge that the transaction was done fraudulently. Mameh said Olawuwo fraudulently transferred N500, 000 to Wahab from a customer’s  account. The prosecutor said Olawuwo transferred N1.9 million to Kazeem Olanrewaju, who is at large, adding that the transfer was done five times.
