The body of former Afghan President, Sibghatullah Mujaddadi, was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard in Kabul amid tight security on Wednesday. Mujaddadi, who died on Monday at the age of 93, was also the founder and leader of Jebha-e-Nejat-e Melli (National Liberation Front). Hundreds of people, including President Mohammad Ghani, his predecessor Hamid Karzai and cabinet ministers attended
the funeral ceremony performed in the Presidential Palace. Paying tribute to late Mujaddadiâ€™s services, Ghani described his death as a great loss for the nation and declared
Wednesday as national mourning day.
