The All Progressives Congress senatorial candidate in Ekiti North district of Ekiti State, Senator Olubunmi Adetumbi, yesterday, said the flaws of the smart card readers have been slowing down voting in some units in his ward. Adetumbi spoke after voting in his unit, saying the mammoth crowd being witnessed in his ward 2, Unit 003 at Ifaki Ekiti in Ido/Osi local government area of the state, was causing serious alarm. The former national assembly member added that most of the voters had waited for over two hours and still expecting to vote as a result of the situation. “Though INEC had brought another smart card reader which has started working but we pray it doesn’t malfunction again like we have been witnessing. You can see large crowd of voters still expecting to be accredited after waiting here since 8am.
