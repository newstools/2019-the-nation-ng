 Cardiff City have been left stunned after Nantes demanded payment for the £15million transfer of Emiliano Sala, who is missing and feared dead, after his flight went off-radar on a journey from France to Cardiff. The Premier League club were shocked to receive a formal letter from Nantes on Tuesday asking for payment within 10 days. The two clubs are now embroiled in a legal dispute. Cardiff’s first payment would ordinarily be due within seven days of the player signing, but the club do not intend to make any payments until the conclusion of official investigations into the causes of his disappearance. However, Nantes made an email request last Thursday and then followed it up with a formal written request on Tuesday. Sala’s mother, sister and brother have this week been in the company of the Argentine consular in France as investigations continued after a private plane carrying Sala and pilot David Ibbotson went off-radar on January 21 A body has been located in the aircraft but the two families were still to be informed of the identity as of Wednesday. The Sala family are currently in Nantes anxiously awaiting the fate of Emiliano and are still to learn whether it is even his body in the aircraft. There is understandable bewilderment from those close to Sala that distasteful financial discussions can even be taking place while the search for his body continues.  The Air Accidents Investigation Branch have been searching the English channel for the wreckage. An official investigation into the crash, including the pilot’s qualifications and the condition of the plane, is likely to follow. The situation is further complicated as French club Bordeaux are also due 50 per cent of the reported £15m transfer due to a clause inserted when Sala joined Nantes in 2015.
