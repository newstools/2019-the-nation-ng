Laaylow Entertainment artiste, Brite Benson, otherwise known as Local Boy has shown his interest in one of Nigeria’s reigning stars, Teni the Entertainer. The US-based Afro-Pop singer chose Teni over other Nigerian female celebrities. “I don’t have anybody in mind than, Teni,” said Local Boy. “I love Teniola because she is a great artiste.” Local Boy started music as an undergraduate while studying Cyber Security in the United States. Since then, he has made several appearances on big stages both locally and internationally. To grow his fan-base, Local Boy caught the attention of music lovers when he performed his yet-to-be-released song, ‘Sokoyokoto’ at the just concluded Access Bank Lagos City Marathon. “This just a tip,” said Local Boy to the crowd. “I have a lot coming, you guys should watch out for me as I am ready to take you on a different journey. I promise to give you all good vide, anytime, any day.” The multi-talented act became a prominent figure in 2017, when he dropped an impressive pop single titled, ‘Slay Mama.’ He followed up with ‘One Way’ featuring CDQ. “One Way is just a street slang,” said Local Boy on his motive for recording the song. “You know, when a vehicle is touring a One way on the street, it became an offence which means the person is doing a bad thing. So, the song is to preach righteous to people who are doing wrong things.”
