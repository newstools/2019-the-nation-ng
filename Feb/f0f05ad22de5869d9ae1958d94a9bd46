Political thugs on Monday disrupted the Ogun State All Progressives Congress (APC) rally at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Abeokuta. The thugs believed to have sympathies for a party went around the stadium chasing away supporters of the APC governorship candidate in the state, Dapo Abiodun. Many of them were injured in the process with those adorning the yellow attire of Abiodun specifically targeted. The thugs were armed with dangerous weapons, forcing Abiodunâ€™s supporters to run for safety. Many of them removed materials bearing the name of Abiodun to avoid further attacks. When the campaign finally started with President Muhammadu Buhari on seat, the thugs prevented National Chairman of the Comrade Adam Oshiomhole from addressing the crowd. Oshiomhole had hardly spoken for a minute before they started throwing stones at the stage, forcing officials to appeal to him to stop. Governor Ibikunle Amosun took the microphone appealing to the violent supporters to calm down before Vice President Yemi Osinbajo took over. Osinbajo, an indigene of the state, appealed for support, promising the Buhari-led administration will uplift the people.
