A 40-year-old panel beater, Adekunle Adegbeso, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for alleged theft of a Lagos State Ministry of Sports Toyota Hilux Pick-up valued at N4.5 million. Adegbeso pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Michael Unah said the defendant committed the offence with others at large in July 2017 at Ladoje Street, off Oko-Oba, Lagos. He alleged that the defendant, who was given the Toyota Hilux with number-plate HN697EKY to repair, sold it and converted the money to his use. “Attempts to retrieve the van or the money from the defendant proved abortive,” Unah said. Chief Magistrate A. A. Fashola granted the defendant N400, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payments to the Lagos State Government. Fashola added that the sureties should be relations of the defendant and live in the court’s jurisdiction. The case continues on March 20.
