Two men, Paul Kahomen and Ettenne Hounsa, who allegedly set up a clinic and posed as doctors, yesterday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court. Kahomen, 30, and Hounsa, 20, are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, unlawful possession of medical instruments/drugs and impersonation. They pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Lucky Ihiehie said they committed the offence on February 4 at Oworonshoki, Lagos. He said the defendants were found with medical instruments and drugs. “They operate an illegal clinic, where they admit patients, carry out abortions, administer dangerous pills and deliver expectant mothers of their babies. “This practice has resulted in the death of many innocent people,” he alleged.
