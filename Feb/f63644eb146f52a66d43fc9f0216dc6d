A block moulder and bricklayer, Daniel Ezekiel, who allegedly had forcible sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old food vendor, was on Monday remanded in prison custody by an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Ezekiel, 23, who resides at Elegushi area of Lagos, was arraigned by the Igando Police Station on a one-count charge of defilement before Mrs K. O. Doja-Ojo. Prosecuting Inspector Peace Chukwudi alleged that the defendant committed the offence at about 3pm on January 30, at Ikate Elegushi, Lekki, Lagos. She said the defendant had unlawful, forcible carnal knowledge with the girl. The court heard that the girl went to the defendant to collect money for a plate of food she sold to him earlier, when Ezekiel, instead of paying, grabbed and sexually violated her Chukwudi said the offence contravenee Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The plea of the defendant was not taken, because the court had no jurisdiction to try the alleged offence. Instead, the prosecutor made an application praying the court to remand Ezekiel pending legal advice from the Directorate of Public Prosecution  (DPP). Upholding the application, Magistrate Doja-Ojo, remanded Ezekiel in prison custody and adjourned till February 27 for the DPP’s legal advice on the matter.
