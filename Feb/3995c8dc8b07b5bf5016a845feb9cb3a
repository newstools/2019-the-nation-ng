Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode on Wednesday congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for their victory at the 2019 presidential election, saying that it was a victory well deserved. Governor Ambode, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Habib Aruna, said the victory was not just a confirmation of the people’s love for President Buhari but an attestation that Nigerians were happy with the progress the Federal Government has made in the last four years. The Governor said: “Let me join millions of our loyal party faithful in the State and across the country to congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo for their resounding victory at last Saturday’s polls. ‘This is indeed a historic moment because Nigerians have used their votes to show Mr. President that they are happy with the progress the country has made on several sectors of the polity. “This is a victory for democracy; it is a victory for good governance and a clear statement from Nigerians that they are ready to move to the next level with President Muhammadu Buhari.” He expressed confidence the Buhari-led administration would consolidate on the achievements of the last four years and justify the renewal of his mandate by millions of Nigerians at the polls. “This is a threshold of our political history. I urge Nigerians to rally round the Federal Government and support the drive to take the nation to the next level,” Ambode said. He also commended Lagosians for coming out in thousands and for being peaceful and orderly throughout the period of the elections. Besides, the Governor congratulated candidates of the party in the National Assembly elections who emerged victorious, saying that with APC in the majority in both chambers, President Buhari would get the needed support from the legislative arm of government to transform Nigeria for good.
