Using a variety of local and foreign case studies, legal experts have educated MUSON scholars on the fundamentals of intellectual property rights, discussing its benefits and possible consequences of its negligence. The first in the quarterly series themed “Copyright & Intellectual Property Protection”, the event held at the Agip Recital Hall of the MUSON Centre, Lagos. Speaking on the new initiative, Nonny Ugboma, Executive Secretary of MTN Foundation, stated, “We have a long-term commitment to the development of young talent, as demonstrated through our interventions over the years. “Last year, we sponsored a masterclass with the renowned countertenor, Daniel Taylor and soprano impresario, Ellen McAteer for all students of the MUSON School of Music; our desire to see well-rounded music professionals who are skilful, and understand the business of music led us to introduce this workshop series for participants in the music scholarship programme. The workshops will help prepare the scholars for the real world.” Commenting on the intervention, Princess Banke Ademola, Director, School of Music, MUSON, appreciated the Foundation, reminded attendees at the inaugural workshop that, “What MTN Foundation is offering is critical learning often overlooked or unavailable to aspiring artistes. It’s difficult to find words to express my delight that beyond supporting the scholarship programme, MTN Foundation, is providing this opportunity.” The collaboration between MTN Foundation and MUSON dates back to 2006, with the initiation of a scholarship programme that has produced hundreds of graduates from the MUSON School of Music, who are currently achieving laudable feats in various spheres of arts and culture globally.
