A 27-year-old student, Precious Otuya, was yesterday arraigned before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing his flatmate’s N150,000. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said the defendant committed the offence on December 31, last year, at about 8am, at 21, Bajulaiye Road, Shomolu, Lagos. She alleged that the complainant, Mr. Lawani Ojor, woke up that morning to receive a debit alert of N150,000 from his First Bank account. Olaluwoye said Ojor had at that time noticed that his ATM card was missing. “My Lord, Otuya was the only flatmate the complainant had, whom he accommodated, being a student of Yaba College of Technology. “The defendant stole the ATM card, withdrew the money and travelled to his village in Delta State where he was arrested,” she alleged. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Section 280(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised). The accused pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendant N200,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties addresses should be verified. Oghere ordered the sureties to provide evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 8.
