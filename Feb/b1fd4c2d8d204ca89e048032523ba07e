The Presidential Advisory Committee on Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA)  has embarked on a mission to the Southwest. The committee, headed by the retired brigadier-General Muhammed Buba Marwa and wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, Dolapo said the survey by the United Nations Office on Drug Control (UNODC) contains high prevalence of drug abuse. Speaking for the committee, Alhaji Abubakar Jimoh, the Director of Public Affairs in the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), said the report had showed that Nigeria has a national average of 14.4 per cent prevalence, which almost tripled the world average of 5.6 per cent. According to the report, Lagos State has the highest figure of 33 per cent followed by Oyo State with 22 per cent. Describing drug abuse menace as hydra-headed, Jimoh, however, said: “This was not insurmountable considering the star-studded composition of the Committee headed by General Marwa, whose antecedents in Lagos with his Operation Sweep and successful military career, are strong pointers to the fact that PACEDA is a serious-minded and achievement-oriented Committee. “I am very happy that General Marwa had accepted the gauntlet with the proposed launch of War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), which will further amplify and accentuate the Youth Against Drug Abuse (YADA) programme launched last December in Kano by Director-General of NAFDAC, Professor Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye. “The combined forces of WADA, YADA and several interventions by National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), UNODC and other agencies will surely lead to accelerated elimination of the growing monster of drug abuse in Nigeria. The committee is on that finding and advocacy visits to all the geo-political zones in the country.”
