Many people are feared dead after Boko Haram insurgents attacked four communities in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State. The insurgents invaded Madagali town, Gulak, Magar and Shuwa on Tuesday evening, killing and destroying properties before they were overpowered by soldiers who forced them to retreat. The Tuesday attack on Madagali was the third in nine days, after an attack on February 4 when three residents lost their lives and another on February 11 when a village head and a soldier were killed. The current attack forced many residents out of Madagali, including one Ruth Gauje, who fled to the state capital, Yola. She told our correspondent on Wednesday evening that at least one person died in Shuwa where she came from. “They killed Friday, a popular young man in our place,” she said. She also said a community leader in Madagali identified as Bulama and several other people died in the town. Some other sources, however, said most of the invading insurgents were killed unlike when they first launched attack on the Madagali LGA on February 4 and 11. Civilian and military sources in Madagali insisted the soldiers overpowered the insurgents after some exchanges of gunfire. The soldiers were said to have killed an unspecified number and seized weapons and vehicles of the terrorists. “Sounds of gunshots and heavy blasts rented the air as the battle between the soldiers and Boko Haram insurgents reigned, forcing the insurgents out into surrounding mountains and bushes,” a source said. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, Othman Abubakar, confirmed the killing and repelling of the Boko Haram insurgents but couldn’t confirm casualties. He told our correspondent a combined team of security personnel succeeded in decimating the Boko Haram insurgents. He, however, stated he had no information on the fatality among residents.
