Former United States of America’s (USA) President Bill Clinton will not be in Abuja on Wednesday for the second National Peace Accord signing ahead of the general elections. Clinton, according to the Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar led Peace Accord committee was expected to deliver a keynote address at the event slated for the International Conference Centre (ICC) Abuja. Clinton, the committee said, was expected to hold meetings with President Muhammadu Buhari and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar aimed at nipping threats of unrest in the bud. But a statement by Clinton’s spokesman Angel Ureña regretted the former President’s visit might be politicised in a way that is not in line with the goals of the committee. The statement said: “President Clinton appreciates General Abdulsalami Abubakar and the Nigerian National Peace Committee’s invitation to travel to Nigeria. “He is incredibly supportive and respectful of the committee’s efforts, of the election process, and of the work being done to try to ensure a peaceful, free, fair, and transparent outcome. “This is a crucial time in Nigeria, and President Clinton is hopeful that the election’s outcome reflects the will of the Nigerian people. “Over the course of the last several days, and after various conversations with the different stakeholders, it’s become apparent that President Clinton’s visit to Nigeria has the potential to be politicized in a way that is not in line with the goals of the committee. Therefore, he will not be traveling to Abuja. “He looks forward to talking to both candidates and General Abubarkar this week.“
