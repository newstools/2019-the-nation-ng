Head coach of Nigeria National U-17 team, Manu Garba has revealed that his team is more than fifty per cent ready for the 2019 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations. Nigeria will play host Tanzania in the opening game of the U-17 AFCON on April 14. The Golden Eaglets who are five-time world champions are also billed to participate in a pre-tournament competition in Turkey next month. When asked if he was under pressure, having failed to qualify the team for the last AFCON and World Cup, the 2013 U-17 World Cup-winning coach says he is not new in the terrain and boasted that he hopes to qualify for the 2019 World Cup as African champions. ”All my life I don’t even know the word pressure because I am a firm believer of destiny. Nigeria being the best at U-17 level, I happen to be one of the coaches that have two World Cup medals,” said Manu Garba. ”I had never been under pressure because we believe in what we are doing to make sure we prepare our team very well for this competition.” ”The ultimate is to go to Tanzania first, qualify for the World Cup but most importantly, qualify as African champions. ”These are our aspirations, we just have one and half months to prepare but God willing, we would raise a team to make Nigeria proud by qualifying for the World Cup as African champions.” Nigeria, who also trade tackles with Angola and Uganda in Group A, will automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup if they finish among the top four teams of the eight-team tournament.
