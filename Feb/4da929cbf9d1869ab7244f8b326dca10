The Federal High Court in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, yesterday refused the application of a member of the House of Representatives, Oladipupo Adebutu, and others seeking to prevent the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Buruji Kashamu, and others, from being joined as “necessary and interested parties” in a suit pending before the court. Adebutu and others had filed the suit asking the court for an order of mandamus to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to publish their names in place of the ones already published by the commission. When the matter came up yesterday, counsel to Kashamu and others, Prince Raphael Ajibola Oluyede, informed the court that his clients, the candidates whose names had been published by INEC, were interested in the matter but were not joined. The lawyer said they had filed an application as interveners willing to be joined. But counsel to the plaintiffs, Mr. Afolabi Fashanu (SAN), objected to the joining of the applicant/interveners. After much argument, the court, presided over by Justice Abubakar Shittu, held that the applicant/interveners were necessary parties that should have been joined. The court thus joined them. Then, Oluyede informed the court that they had filed an affidavit that the plaintiffs and their collaborators were parading themselves as candidates of the party while they were still before the court praying to be declared as candidates. The court directed the parties and their counsel to refrain from being used to foist a fait accompli on the court or cause a breakdown of law and order. The court adjourned till February 14 for hearing of the substantive suit and all pending applications before it.
