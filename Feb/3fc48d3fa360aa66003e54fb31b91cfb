MainOne and Facebook have partnered over  metro fiber infrastructure project in two states of Nigeria. The collaboration in infrastructure is part of Facebook’s efforts to connect more people to broadband internet. As part of this project, MainOne is building and operating approximately 750 km terrestrial fiber infrastructure in Edo and Ogun states, two of Nigeria’s fastest growing states. These open-access transport networks will provide metro fiber connectivity to reach more than 1,000,000 people in Benin City, Abeokuta, Sagamu and 10 other towns by connecting mobile operators’ base stations, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Points of Presence (PoPs), and public locations including schools and hospitals. The partnership will leverage MainOne’s strength as a wholesale telecoms infrastructure service provider with investment from Facebook and support from local regulatory and state authorities to further deepen broadband penetration in Nigeria.
