 The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded immediate halt to the ongoing collation of results of Saturday’s presidential election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The main opposition party said collation of results must be stopped until data from the smart card reader accreditation at the polling units are made available to all the parties in the election. At a media briefing in Abuja Tuesday, the Deputy Director General (Admin) of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Dr Tanimu Turaki SAN, the party cited manipulations, rigging and over-voting in some states by the All Progressives Congress (APC). “The PDP predicates its demand on available evidence to the effect that data from the card readers are being reconfigured to suit the manipulations, rigging and over-voting already carried out during the election in some states by the All Progressives Congress (APC)”, Turaki said. Turaki added that the National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus had already communicated the party’s position to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. “We have evidence from the smart card reader accreditation data that what is being announced by INEC has been seriously tampered with and manipulated”, Turaki said. The main opposition party also demanded the immediate and outright cancellation of results of the presidential election in Borno, Yobe, Zamafara and Nasarawa States, as submitted by INEC’s presiding officers. The PDP called for the conduct of fresh elections in the affected states. Continuing, the PDP chieftain said, “In Yobe, the total number of votes submitted as cast was more than the number of accredited voters. Whereas the number of accredited voters was 601, 056, the total votes cast was 775, 449. “This is a clear case of over-voting which, by the provisions of the Electoral Act, renders the election null and void. In such instance, the law provides for another election on a day to be fixed by INEC. “In Zamfara state, no actual voting took place and there was no single result sheet in any polling unit in the entire state. There was an arrest in Shinkafi Local Government, where an APC member was caught thump-printing ballot papers inside his house. “Results from the presiding officer from Zamfara were concocted and allocated according to the wishes of the leadership of the APC and INEC. “The PDP therefore demands the outright deletion of the results from Zamfara from INEC records and a conduct of free, fair and credible presidential election in Zamfara state. “Also in Borno state, there was no election but a figure writing exercise and allocation of results according to the whims and caprices of the APC leaders. We also demand the outright deletion of the results from Borno from INEC records and a conduct of free, fair and credible presidential election in Borno state. “In Nasarawa, the PDP demands the immediate restoration of our over 157, 000 lawful and valid votes which were unlawfully and arbitrarily cancelled by INEC and the announcement of the actual results from the field. “Similarly, the PDP demands an immediate restoration of our over 79, 000 valid votes which were unlawfully cancelled by INEC in Kogi state and the announcement of the authentic results inclusive of the restored 79,000 votes “In the FCT, the PDP demands the restoration of 27,000 valid votes unlawfully and arbitrarily cancelled by INEC and a declaration of the authentic result, inclusive of our restored 27,000 votes. “In Plateau, the PDP demands the immediate restoration of our over 30,000 lawful and valid votes, which were unlawfully cancelled particularly in Jos North and the declaration of the genuine results as delivered at the polling units inclusive of our 30,000 restored votes”. The PDP called on Nigerians to disregard the results until INEC provides the data from the smart card reader accreditation at the polling units, conducts fresh election in Borno, Yobe and Zamfara states as well as restore its votes in Plateau, FCT, Kogi and Nasarawa states. “The PDP maintains that from the actual votes delivered at the polling units, which we all have, Nigerians clearly and unequivocally gave their mandate to Atiku Abubakar”, Turaki declared.
