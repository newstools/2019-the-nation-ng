University of Lagos (UNILAG) Vice-Chancellor (VC) Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and Architects Registration Council Of Nigeria (AR CON) leaders have met over a partially collapsed building in the school. The seven-storey building, which is under construction, is being proposed as the new library. It is beside the UNILAG bookshop, adjacent to Mariere Hall, near the Senate building. The Nation learnt that no one died in the incident. ARCON, led by its President, Sir Dipo Ajayi, visited the site on assessment, but could not gain access. But he, with council members Kayode Anibaba, Adebayo Dipe and Ladipo Lewis were briefed by Ogundipe. Ogundipe said the building was sealed off immediately it collapsed. The VC said UNILAG Council Chairman Dr. Wale Babalakin took over further actions on the project and investigations after he was briefed. The Nation learnt that ATO Architects, Landmark Structural Engineers, Tuber Consult Quantity Surveyors, IFC Mech and Elect, CPMS Project Manager and Dutum Company Ltd are the project’s consultants. Ogundipe said the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) awarded the contract, describing it as a fixed contract with counterpart funding from UNILAG. He said he notified the investigative panel raised by the university of his observations about the contractor, his inadequacies and slow pace of work. Ajayi requested that Dipe  be allowed to serve on the panel as ARCON’s representative. The new Director of Works, Babatunde Oloko, took the ARCON team to the site for  visual inspection. The team is expected back today after getting Babalakin’s nod to access the site.
