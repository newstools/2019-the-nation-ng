The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed the judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying primary elections of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers state. By implication, the APC chapter in River State will not be fielding candidates in the upcoming general elections. In a statement Friday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party described the apex court’s judgment as victory for democracy and the rule of law. The statement said, “The party commends the apex court for its courage in delivering the landmark judgment, which has saved the nation from a serious constitutional crisis that could have marred the 2019 general elections and detract from our overall electoral system. “The judgment of the Supreme Court serves as a huge lesson to politicians and political parties, to eschew impunity and always conduct their affairs in a manner that is in tandem with the provision of the law. “The courage displayed by the Supreme Court in delivering the judgment at this critical time in our national life has also restored the confidence of Nigerians in the institution of the Judiciary and our democratic order. “The PDP however urges its teeming members across the country to continue to work hard in consolidating on the already established victory of our great party in all elections, beginning with next Saturday’s presidential election”.
