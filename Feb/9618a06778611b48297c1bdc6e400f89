SOS Children’s Villages Nigeria yesterday inaugurated infrastructure in eight primary schools in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State, which it renovated and improved. The non-governmental organisation (NGO) said the projects, carried out in partnership with The Trust of Harry and Carol Goodman, began last April when approval was obtained from the Lagos State Government. It cost over N50million, SOS Nigeria National Director Eghosa Erhumwunse said. He said SOS assessed the schools’ needs, adding that the choice of projects for each school was made by stakeholders, including the schools’ management, children and members of the community. “Four thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven pupils from eight schools will benefit directly from this initiative by SOS Children’s Villages,” Erhumwunse added. The schools are: Ilasamaja Primary School, Kusoru Primary School, St. Paul Primary School, Akinbaye Primary School, Ajao Estate Primary School, Farombi Primary School, Estate Primary School and Local Government Primary School. The projects included repair of doors, windows, fixing of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) ceilings, provision of desks and chairs, renovation of classrooms, an admin block, sick bay, provision of First Aid box with kits, installation of electrical fittings, renovation of toilets, repair and provision of borehole, water stanchion, provision of 2.5kva generator and pumping machine, among others.

The Secretary of Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Mrs. Ajimoti Kehinde, who represented the Chairman, Dr.  Ganiyu Sopeyin, praised the donors for the gesture. Kehinde added: “The government can’t do it alone. This is why the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration has always emphasised Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP).”
