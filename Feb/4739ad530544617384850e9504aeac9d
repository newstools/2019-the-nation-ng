Nigeria’s second largest carrier, Globacom and global information communication technology (ICT) firm, Huawei Technologies have partnered to reward Nigerian students across institutions in the country with a combination of high-end smartphones and super-fast internet service. The programme, targeted at 30 universities and 150 Nigerian students, will be offering free Huawei smartphones loaded with six months unlimited Glo 4G data to five students and five Huawei routers with pre-loaded 60GB of Glo 4G data to the institution. Students to be rewarded are the top five final year students in each institution.
