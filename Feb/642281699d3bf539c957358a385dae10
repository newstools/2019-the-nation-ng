Two labourers, who allegedly stole N285,000 from a shop, were yesterday charged before an Apapa Magistratesâ€™ Court. Mohammed Awal, 24, and Shefiu Garuba, 21, allegedly committed the offence in connivance with others at large on February 2, on Moshood Abiola Way, Ijora-Badia, Lagos. They pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Friday Inedu said the defendants committed the offence in connivance with others at large on February 2, on Moshood Abiola Way, Ijora-Badia, Lagos. He alleged that the defendants and the accomplices forcefully entered a shop belonging to Mr Nosiru Qudus and stole the sum. Inedu said the defendants hit Qudus with a metal on the head, when he attempted to call for help. He said a woman, who has a shop opposite Qudus, saw what happened and alerted nearby policemen, who arrested the defendants, while their accomplices escaped with the money. Magistrate T.O. Babalola granted the defendants N100,000 bail each with two sureties each in the like sum. He said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on April 3.
