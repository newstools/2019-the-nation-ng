Registered voters now have up to Monday to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday extended the collection period  by three days, including today and tomorrow. In addition, card collection can be made up to 6pm everyday as against the normal 4pm, according to  INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. Yakubu said the commission was ready for the polls which are taking off next Saturday with the Presidential and National Assembly elections. He PVCs that are not collected by Monday would  be recalled and deposited at the CBN until  after the elections. All state offices of INEC were directed to “review the procedure for the collection of PVCs and dedicate all the staff of the local government offices to the collection process.” The commission reassured Nigerians that it would  ”continue to take every necessary step to ensure that no registered voter is disenfranchised on account of non-collection of PVCs. Similarly, the commission is taking urgent steps to address complaints of the unavailability of the PVCs of some registered voters before the end the deadline for the collection.”
