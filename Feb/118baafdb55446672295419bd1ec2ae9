Immigration Officers Wives Association (IMMOWA) of Zone A, Ikeja, Lagos State, has donated some items to Little Saints Orphanage, Palm Grove, Lagos. It donated drinks, water,  rice, salt, noodles, groundnut oil and snacks when it visited the orphanage. Its Chairperson, Hajia Aisha Alfa, said the gesture was to show love to the children. “This donation is to show the children our love and to let them know that we are with them in spirit, although we don’t see them. It is also to show our motivation and appreciation to them,” she added. Alfa said the association in the past donated items to other orphanages, “but this is our first time at Little Saints Orphanage.” She urged all to show orphanage children love and care. “To be an orphan does not mean God does not love you. It is not good for a child to be abandoned. Anyone who could carry a child for nine months should be able to care, cater for and show love to the child, because some people are out there who do not have children and desire to have their own,” she said. The founder of the orphanage, Rev Dele George, said “This is the first time IMMOWA will be visiting us and we are thankful. We can see their donations everywhere.”
