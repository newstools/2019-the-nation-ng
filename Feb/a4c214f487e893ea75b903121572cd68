The Chief Executive Officer, ENYO Retail and Supply Limited, an retail outlet,  Abayomi Awobokun, said the company has invested over N8 billion in the downstream retail business with eyes on expanding its market share in the petroleum sub-sector. Awobokun, in a press outing yesterday in Lagos, said set up the company to impact positively in the downstream subsector of the oil and gas industry, adding that despite the challenges confronting the petroleum industry, his team of investors is ready to expand beyond its present market share, going forward. He said Enyo is the first to offer customers what he termed loyalty scheme, which he said is an opportunity to reward its loyal buyers. “We want to use innovations and modern designs to our advantage to grow business in the downstream. Enyo doesn’t want to get involved in the business of importing products. We buy from those that import and then sell,” he said. He urged the government to look at issues such as supply shortages, customers distrust, congestion and poor road facilities. He said the firm is looking at delving into a 24-hour service in the future with a combination of pumps where customers can either serve themselves, or be served by attendants. He added that the firm is planning on buying over stations across the country for rapid growth. “There are negative stigmas affecting the downstream sector. Past events have given it a bad name. There is general distrust between the customers and the marketers. The economy is also another challenge. Nigerians don’t buy fuel for luxury like driving from Lagos to Akure just for sightseeing. They buy fuel for essentials and not pleasure. “There is also the challenge of lack of basic infrastructure. Moving of products from the depots to the filling stations is very challenging. But despite all these challenges, there is still room for growth,’’ he said.
