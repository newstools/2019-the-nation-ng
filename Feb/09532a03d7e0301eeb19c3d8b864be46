 Nine time African Champions Super Falcons will need to up their preparation and game if they are to make appreciable impact at this year’s World cup in France. Former Falcons ace and African women’s player of the year, Mercy Akide-Udoh who made the submission, noted that other countries heading to France for the showdown are playing series of friendly matches while the Falcons appear to be having an evening stroll in the garden. Nigeria’s programme ahead of the tournament includes participation in the Cyprus Cup and a camp in Austria, but Akide-Udoh, who starred as Nigeria reached the quarterfinals of the 1999 World Cup, insists that is not enough. “To have a good tournament and avoid another embarrassing outing, the girls deserve to compete against the very best in the women’s game to get themselves ready, “she told BBC Sport. “Other countries going to the World Cup are playing friendlies, but we are not which is not a good sign. “I have always said that Nigeria must start showing that we deserve to be at the World Cup and stop being contented with just participating since 1991,” added the US based former Pelican stars ace On areas she considers a must re-touch in the build up to the world cup, Mercy who graced the last African Best Player award recently held in Dakar Senegal with former teammate Perpetua Nkwocha, singled out defence for comment “We have a lot of work to do defensively and also in our ball possessions as well,” she said. Falcons who finished third in the recently concluded four nation tournament in China, will hopefully honour the Cyprus Cup billed for February 25 to March 7. The team will face Belgium, Austria and Slovakia in Group C at the Cyprus event.
