 Italian giants Juventus are ready to dole out €200 million to have Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah it has been revealed. The Egypt international has continued to impress for the Reds in his second season at the club, having joined the Merseyside outfit from AS Roma ahead of the 2017-18 campaign. Salah, who scored 44 goals across all competitions in his debut season at Anfield, has already found the back of the net on 20 occasions this season. The 26-year-old enjoyed a successful spell in the Serie A at first Fiorentina and then Roma who he left in favour of the Reds for a reported €42 million. Sky News Arabia, though, report that the Old Lady are willing to pay more than four times that price in an attempt to lure Salah back to Italy. Juventus have further signaled their intent to fight for UEFA Champions League glory with the purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo who has taken the Italian League by storm this season. The Italians next face Frosinone in the league before travelling to the venue of this year’s Champions League final to take on Atletico Madrid in a Round of 16 first-leg tie next week. Arsenal ace Aaron Ramsey only few days back signed a deal that will see him join Juve at the end of the season and will going home with about £400k-a-week. Should the desire to have Salah materialise, Juve would have beefed up with three heavy weight players after grabbing former Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo just after the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Egypt will be hosting this year African Cup on Nations in June and the pharaohs are banking on the Salah to lift the team as they aim to win the continental title for the 8th time.  The last time Egypt won the title was in 2010 in Angola.
