Some Nigerian artistes have recently gathered to condemn human rights abuse at a summit organised by actor Yomi Fabiyi. Among those in attendance at the summit with the theme, ‘Serial Human Rights Violators; a threat to Nigeria’s peace and development’ are Tope Mark-Odigie, Omo Baba, Kenny Saint Brown, Ara and Ruggedman among others. One of the volunteers, Nollywood actress Kemi Afolabi, spoke on several social ills and decried human rights violations, brutality and cruelty, particularly from law enforcement officers. The actress said she understood the efficacy of giving her voice for humanity, charity and the voiceless. “Yours truly made a decision with top entertainers, renowned human right experts, barristers and so on to stand by the masses,” she said. “Today, break the silence foundation during our human rights summit, we used the platform to educate, promote human rights protection, and say no to brutality and abuse of all forms. We are sacrificing our energy and resources to see that we educate the society on their rights as citizens.”
