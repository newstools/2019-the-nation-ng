The Nigerian Air Force Monday said scores of Boko Haram insurgents have been neutralized by the Air Task Force of operations Lafiya Dole in their hideout in Kolloram, northern Borno, Borno State. A statement by the spokesman of the Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the clearance operations against the terrorists were conducted after intelligence reports indicated their presence in the area. Air Commodore Daramola said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has neutralized several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters as they assembled for a meeting at their hideout in Kolloram on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno State. “The operation was conducted on 24 February 2019 following credible intelligence reports indicating that some of the ISWAP leaders and fighter had assembled for a meeting in a group of buildings at the centre of the settlement. “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, which was deployed for confirmatory surveillance, observed the presence of the terrorists at the location and subsequently called for 2 Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the group of buildings. “Bombs from the first Aplha Jet hit the desired mean point of impact causing damage to the building and neutralizing some of the terrorists. “‘Some of the surviving fighters, who formed the outer security cordon of the meeting venue, were seen engaging the NAF aircraft with Anti-Aircraft (AA) and small arms fire. “The attack aircraft continued to engage the target area with bombs and rockets in several passes, mopping-up the terrorists who survived the initial strikes. “The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast.”
