A bricklayer, Daniel Ezekiel, who allegedly raped a 13-year-old food vendor, was yesterday remanded in prison by an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court. Ezekiel, 23, who lives at Elegushi in Lagos, was arraigned by the Igando Police Station on a one-count charge of defilement before Mrs. K. O. Doja-Ojo. Prosecuting Inspector Peace Chukwudi alleged that the defendant committed the offence at about 3pm on January 30, at Ikate Elegushi, Lekki, Lagos. She said the defendant had unlawful carnal knowledge of the girl. The court heard that the girl went to the defendant to collect money for a plate of food she sold to him earlier, and Ezekiel, instead of paying, grabbed her and sexually violated her. The plea of the defendant was not taken, because the court had no jurisdiction to try the alleged offence. Instead, the prosecutor made an application praying the court to remand Ezekiel pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Upholding the application, Magistrate Doja-Ojo remanded Ezekiel in prison custody and adjourned till February 27 for the DPP’s legal advice on the matter.
