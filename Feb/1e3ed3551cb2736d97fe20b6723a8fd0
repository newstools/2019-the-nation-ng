A 23-year-old man, Rasheed Olanrewaju, who allegedly robbed and was caught in possession of two toy guns, was yesterday remanded at the Kirikiri Prisons by an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. When the case was called for mention, Magistrate Akeem Fashola refused to take the defendant’s plea. He ordered that Olarenwaju be kept behind the bars, pending the receipt of legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The defendant, who lives at Idimu, Lagos, is being tried for unlawful possession of toy guns and robbery. Prosecuting Sergeant Michael Unah said the defendant committed the offence on January 25 in Ikeja.
