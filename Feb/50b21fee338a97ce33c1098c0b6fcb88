Suspected members of Boko Haram yesterday killed at least 11 people in a mosque around Jidari polo area of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. The dead include  the three terrorists who carried out the attack. Fifteen other worshippers were injured. The terrorists struck at about 5.40am during the dawn prayers, according to Police Commissioner Damian Chukwu. The suspects include two suicide bombers and a gunman, who sneaked into  the mosque located at Kushari village behind old CBN quarters. Two suicide bombers were reported to be part of the casualty with several others suspected to be early morning worshipers  sustaining  various degrees of injuries. The State Coordinator of Civilian JTF, Abba Aji Khali  has confirmed the attack said one of the attackers was killed and his weapon recovered. The police chief said the suspects  “infiltrated Gwozari/Kushari in Polo general area, Maiduguri shooting sporadically & detonated IEDs strapped to their bodies.” Chukwu said security operatives had been deployed in the area while investigation was ongoing. The attack came  four days after insurgents opened fire on the convoy of Kashim Shettima, governor of the state. The JTF coordinator said “This attacks will not change any thing, although 8 persons killed and 15 others injured; we killed one of the attacker’s and suicide bomber also died in the attacks. They can not prevent people to come out or deter them not to  vote. I want to say that wherever they hid our troops will get them and flush them out. However, we call on residents to be vigilante and support the troops with useful information.”
