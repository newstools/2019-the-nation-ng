POP star Chisom Ifeachor aka Cheekychizzy has disclosed how he was able to secure a mouth-watering deal with Sony Music Africa. According to Cheekychizzy, the deal was inked with the help of the team he works with. On whether Dbanj influenced the deal, Cheekychizzy said the deal is a joint venture with D’KingsMen (DKM), a platform the ‘Emergency’ crooner owns. The DB Records signee who recently got a Range Rover SUV from his label boss, Dbanj, said his fan base are expecting more from him on daily basis. “The thing is the expectation is high and I don’t have any problem with it at all,” Cheekychizzy said. “When people have a conviction that you are good, you have value to deliver, they expect more, and as an artiste, it’s a privilege for me that my works are out there in the public.” However, Cheekychizzy said that he has a new single, ‘Kokoma’ coming and that he’s more fulfilled associating with Dbanj, adding that exploring with the Kokomaser has enhanced his musical career in ways that are beyond words to express. “Working with Dbanj has been leverage for me when it comes to self-packaging, presentation, self-marketing, and networking. I don’t even need to present my credentials when I my association with Dbanj is acknowledged.”
