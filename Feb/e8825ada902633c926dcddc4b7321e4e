A group, Campaign for Integrity in Governance (CIG), has described the proposal of Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Mr Jimi Agbaje, to spend 50 per cent of the state’s annual budget on education as laughable and a sign of his ignorance about how to run a government. In a statement yesterday by its President Rasaq Olokooba, CIG noted that Agbaje’s proposal confirmed the widespread notion that Lagos, as the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, does not need a greenhorn and an inexperienced person to gevern it. “Mr. Agbaje has clearly demonstrated his poor judgment and incompetence on fiscal matter and in running a local government, let alone a state like Lagos with over 20 million population. It is fiscally impossible for any government anywhere in the world to spend half of its annual budget on a single line item. Lagosians should ask Mr. Agbaje what will happen to other sectors, like health, waste management, security, environment, transportation, among others, if education alone gulps 50 per cent of the budget.
