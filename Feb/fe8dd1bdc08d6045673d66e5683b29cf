At least three persons were feared dead and two others badly injured at a polling units in Amukpe area of Sapele town, Sapele council area of Delta state on Saturday. Although most residents of the area who were found on the scene of the incident were unwilling to volunteer details of what happened for fears of becoming targets of the perpetrators of the attack, a source said those killed were victims of suspected armed thugs. The Nation gathered that some armed persons emerged from the blues and opened fire on the voters who were on the queue, killing two persons instantly. Three persons were reportedly rushed to the hospital, one of which reportedly died later. Efforts to gather more details concerning the identities of the victims or whether the killers went away with election materials were fruitless as those met at the scene refused to talk to journalists. An anonymous source, who spoke to The Nation at the scene of the incident, said the killers surfaced and started shooting at about 12:55pm. According to him: “I’m not sure if they carted election materials away but I saw that the ground of the place was littered with election materials, giving me the impression that they only scattered the materials”. However, when reached for confirmation, the Delta state Commissioner of Police, Adeleke Adeyinka, could not confirm the incident. He said he wanted to get across to the people on the ground in Amukpe before he could say anything. Another reliable security source confirmed the development to The Nation, saying “immediately we heard of the situation, we moved in to take over the area so as to stabilize it and prevent a further escalation of the situation”. Meanwhile, voting was relatively peaceful in most other polling units as voters were seen casting their votes. For instance, Sapele ward 7, units 7 and 8, along Ugberikoko Road, voters were still casting their votes at 2:09pm.
