Again, the campaign train of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, came under attack by political thugs suspected to be working for a particular governorship candidate of an opposition political party in the state, injuring several supporters of Abiodun. The thugs armed with knives, machetes and guns allegedly attacked Abiodun campaign on their way to Ofada town shortly after addressing thousands of party members and supporters who had trooped out to receive him in Owode town in Obafemi – Owode Local Government Area of the state. The Nation gathered that as the campaign train was heading towards Ofada, the hoodlums ambushed them and began to shoot sporadically, hurling stones in torrents at their vehicles. While the security men attached to the campaign convoy managed to evacuate the gubernatorial candidate of APC to safety,  some of his supporters were not lucky as they sustained various degree of injuries varying from gunshot wound, machete and beating while atmosphere of chaos and tension lasted. Some of the campaign vehicles were also destroyed. This latest incident makes it two times that Abiodun campaign train had come under attack since the beginning of February. A week ago, same ugly incident occurred as his campaign train was attacked at the Elega area of Abeokuta North Local Government during his ward to ward campaign tour of the area. However, the Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told The Nation that no report of the Friday incident has been brought to the notice of the Police. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police(DSP), said every governorship candidate in the state has been given adequate security personnel to secure lives and properties during campaign tour, stressing that if there was any of such attacks, it has not yet been reported in any police division within Ogun state.
