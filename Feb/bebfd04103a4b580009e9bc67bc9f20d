Business activities are gradually picking up at the Lagos Ports of Apapa and Tin Can, following the general elections held last Saturday. Most port users had stayed away from the port arena, while some that travelled for the voting exercise are gradually returning to base for their business. At the Lagos Port Complex Apapa and the Tin Can Island Port, both in Lagos, quayside workers were seen returning to work in trickles even as various terminals tried to clear backlog of cargoes that had accumulated during the election period. However, checks by The Nation showed that pressure of haulage vehicles on the clumsy port roads remained light. The situation may not be unconnected with the directive by the Federal Government, ordering a closure of all land borders and seaports from 12 noon on Friday to 12:00 noon on Sunday, 24th February 2019, ahead of the Presidential and National Assembly elections held at the weekend.
