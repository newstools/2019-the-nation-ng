A police station in Ajalli, Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State, has been burnt by hoodlums suspected to be members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). It was alleged that some detainees were freed while some vehicles were also burnt. It was gathered that the hoodlums beat up policemen on duty, shouting ‘no referendum, no election in Biafran territory”. Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed, who confirmed the incident, said there were no casualties. He added that the Commissioner of Police, Mustapha Dandaura, had visited the scene and investigation was on. “It’s a fire incident for now until otherwise proven through investigation. The Commissioner of police is presently at the scene for on-the-spot assessment. He has ordered the DC Department of Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department to conduct investigation to ascertain circumstances surrounding the incident,” he added.
