The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the people of Anambra State to exercise their franchise on Saturday despite the let down by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last weekend. The Chairman of Atiku/Obi Campaign Council, Oseloka Obaze, who addressed reporters yesterday, regretted the economic implications and opportunity cost of the postponement. He maintained that four years was enough time for INEC to prepare for the elections, “the postponement was a systemic failure on the part of INEC,” he added. According to him, INEC must apologise for causing so much frustration and international embarrassment to Nigeria, even as he urged Nigerians to ensure that their voices were heard through the ballot on the rescheduled dates. He said: “INEC should revisit its directives that political campaigns should not be reopened. Our party takes a strong exception to that, and if need be, we are willing to approach the court to seek interpretation of the Electoral Act. “Our party in Anambra State will meet with the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) to inspect those materials, just the way we inspected them when they arrived, to ensure their sanctity has not been violated. And that should apply across board.”
