The leadership of the Ijaw Pride Group (IPG) has slammed the Association of Concerned Bayelsa Professionals (ACBP), for allowing itself to be used by enemies of the Ijaw. According to the group, ACBP was pulling down illustrious people of the Ijaw race. In a statement, IPG Director of Publicity Eboiwei Akpeti noted that recent agitations led by the group against the management of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and the Niger Delta Development Commission ( NDDC) was a misadventure.   He added that the civil society group was being partisan, adding it was not in the interests of  the Ijaw race. He maintained that it was wrong to insinuate that the management of the two organisations were under pressure to fund the operations of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Niger Delta area. He said: “The unfortunate recurring circle of acts of self-destruction by fellow Ijaw. Hardly have fellow Ijaw assisted our sons and daughters that are appointed into sensitive positions to succeed. Instead what you find are efforts at pulling them down”. Akpeti said it was curious that the two federal agencies mentioned in the spurious allegation are both headed by illustrious sons of Bayelsa origin. He said his personal knowledge and interactions with the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Simbi Wabote showed a man of very high integrity and professionalism. “Here is man that has been known and commended across the entire gamut of the Oil and Gas industry in Nigeria and abroad for his high sense of professionalism, integrity and prudence in financial management”. He said IPG considered Wabote, a modern icon and pride of the  Ijaw race and must therefore, be allowed to carry on with the good work he is doing. “They should cooperate with him instead of being brought into the murky waters of politics.” The statement advised the public to ignore the unsubstantiated malicious allegations by ACBP against their illustrious sons.
