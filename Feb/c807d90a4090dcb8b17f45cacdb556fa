The Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has lost his polling unit to his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Muhammadu Buhari. Atiku polled 167 votes against Buhari’s 186 at the 012 polling unit of Ajiya Ward in Jimeta, Yola, a few metres from one of Atiku’s houses. Atiku had voted at the unit several hours earlier, about a quarter after 10 am, along with one of his wives and a number of children. Expectations were high that Atiku would win at the unit, considering the army of supporters that milled around him when he voted, but it became celebration time for Buhari’s own supporters when the ballots were countered and figures announced by the unit presiding officer, Abdulrashid Sarai, just before 5pm.
