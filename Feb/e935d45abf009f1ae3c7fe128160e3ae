Lagos State Government has hailed the Jerusalem pilgrims, who participated in last December’s pilgrimage to Israel, for their good conduct. It advised them to maintain the decorum they exhibited during the exercise and spread the good news of the first-class treatment and welfare packages they enjoyed from the government. Head of Service (HoS) Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, who addressed the pilgrims at a thanksgiving service on Sunday at the Chapel of Christ the Light, Alausa, Ikeja, hailed the conduct of the pilgrims throughout the journey. A statement by the Head, Public Relations Unit, Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board (LSCPWB), Olasimbo Uviesherhe, said the HoS described the service as necessary, considering that the pilgrims successfully completed several days’ spiritual exercise without any hitch. He said it was also necessary because of journey mercy to and from Israel. Said he: “The government appreciates the patronage of the LSCPWB by you and also the way and manner you comported yourself during the pilgrimage. It is to the glory of God and Jesus Christ that you went and came back whole.” Muri-Okunola prayed that the pilgrims would receive speedy answers to their supplications and expectations during the pilgrimage.
