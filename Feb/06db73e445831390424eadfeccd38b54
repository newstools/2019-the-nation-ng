•’I only gave her N1,000 as Xmas gift’ An engineer, Mr. James Onuoha, yesterday told a Lagos High Court that he did not rape his tenant’s 14-year-old niece. He said he only gave her N1,000 as Christmas gift. Testifying before Justice Adedayo Akintoye in his defence in the rape charge against him, Onuoha denied touching the girl when he visited their house at 25, Samuel Amoore Street, Idowu Estate, Ike-Ira Nla, Ajah, Lagos on January 4, 2016. He said as the landlord, he visited the house on inspection. Led in evidence by his counsel, Dr. Victor Olowonla, Onuoha said: “I called Kenneth several times, but he did not pick his calls, so I decided to meet him at home. But when I got there, Kenneth was not there. “I knocked at Kenneth’s apartment until a young girl came out and said he was not around. I asked the girl her age, she said she was 16. “She granted me access to the house for an inspection. “Before then, Kenneth used to hide from me, so I thought he was hiding. I entered only to do inspection. “I did not touch her, it was Christmas period and I gave her N1,000 as gift.” The defendant said his tenant later picked his call at 7pm the same day, “I told him on the phone that his rent was due since two years ago,” he added. Onuoha said two days after his visit to the house; he got a call from his office about a report from Kenneth that he raped the girl. The defendant also narrated how he was invited by the police at Lamgbasa Police Station and how the case was transferred to the Zone II Police Command. Under cross-examination by the prosecutor, Dr. Jide Martins, Onuoha said he did not inform Kenneth that he was coming. He said he did not see his visit to the police station as an opportunity to prove his  innocence. Onuoha said he was not aware that the girl then recently came to Lagos to stay with her uncle. Justice Akintoye adjourned  till March 28.
