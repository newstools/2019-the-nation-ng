Former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose has hailed Nigerians for their courage to withstand what he called a rape on democracy. He described the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in last Saturday’s election as allegedly secured through “the barrel of the gun” and not worth celebrating by the winner. But the former governor did not state how. In a statement yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, by his media aide, Lere Olayinka, the former governor said: “Rather than a word of congratulation (sic) to President Buhari, who will be leading our country against our wish as a nation, Nigerians are the ones who deserve to be praised for their courage.” He described the roles played by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies in the election as shameful. Reiterating his avowed commitment to the defence of the oppressed in the country, Fayose said: “As already known, I am not afraid of arrest and detention. I have been persecuted and still being persecuted because of my stand on national issues and I will remain undaunted. “Let me, therefore, commend Nigerians and tell them that they should not lose hope because help will come someday.”
