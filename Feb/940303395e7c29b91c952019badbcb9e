LAGOS State University (LASU) Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Olanrewaju Fagbohun has promised that today’s Students Union election will be free, fair and credible. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday, on the sidelines of a political debate organised by the university for the aspirants, that students will vote electronically. The election was earlier slated for sometime last year, but was postponed because of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike. Fagbohun said management would work with the LASU Students Union (LASUSU) and Independent Electoral Committee (IEC) to ensure a hitch-free poll. Activities pertaining to the election, he said,  were being handled by the students’ body, to prevent interference from the authority. “The students are conducting the election themselves as part of our adopted strategy as a management to train our students for leadership roles. “So, what we are doing is to give them support. “We believe that allowing them to conduct these activities will make them to understand what it means to do something that is fair and credible. “This is part of the leadership and mentorship we must give to them.”
