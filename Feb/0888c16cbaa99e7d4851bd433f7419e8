The National Executive Council of Traditional Rulers of Oil Minerals Producing Communities of Nigeria (TROMPCON) has urged the new Board members of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to reposition the commission to enviable heights. The traditional rulers said the essence of establishing the agency was for development of the Niger Delta and must achieve its set goals. A statement by its National Secretary, Dr. Obafemi Ogbaro hailed the new Board members led by its Acting Managing Director, Prof. Nelson Brambaifa. It urged the presidency to allow NDDC operate with an act that established the commission. The statement noted that TROMPCON as member of NDDC partner for sustainable peace committee and projects monitoring team would appreciate the immediate completion of all abandoned projects across the region. It also appealed to the new board against discriminating payment to contractors, who borrowed huge amount of money to complete jobs, but still undergoing unnecessary bureaucratic bottleneck. The council charged the new NDDC Board to give utmost respect to its stakeholders especially the traditional rulers of the mandate area. It reaffirmed its support for the new board members in the task of developing the Niger Delta region.
