Sen Abdulaziz Nyako, the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Adamawa State,
has said he would tame crime through checkmating drug abuse if he becomes the next governor of the state. He made the commitment in Dumne, a rural community in Song LGA, when he paid a campaign visit there, stressing that crime would be reduced to near nill across the state if youths are taken off drugs. Drug abuse is a major challenge in Adamawa State and Nyako’s remark called to mind a recent assertion by the state command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) that most crimes are committed under the influence of drugs. Sen Abdulazeez Nyako, reiterating his commitment towards ensuring eradication of drug abuse in the state, said it would be achieved through concerted efforts and he would enthusiastically lead and power the efforts. “We must checkmate drug abuse for our society to prosper. We should be in the vanguard in eliminating drug addiction which increases crime in the society,” he said. At another campaign venue, in Wurude, also in Song LGA, Abdulaziz Nyako pledged a rice milling factory along the banks of a massive body of water called River Kilange. He said the rice mill would help the local farmers as it would facilitate dry season irrigation and benefit the people because it would ensure food sufficiency. He said the project’s blueprint was conceived by his father, former Gov. Murtala Nyako, and would be implemented next year by the ADC government if voted into power. He said the rice mill would complement food security, which he said is his priority plan.
