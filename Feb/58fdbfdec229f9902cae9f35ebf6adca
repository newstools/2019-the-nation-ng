Two men and a woman were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly stealing 10 bags of cocoa beans valued at N8 million. The defendants, Romanus Adah, 42, Soroghaye Stanley, 39, and Sherifat Hamza, 50, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing before Chief Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat. Police prosecutor Benson Emuerhi said the defendants committed the offence on September 14, last year at Isolo, Lagos. He alleged that the defendants conspired with others at large to steal the farm produce belonging to Olam Nig. Ltd. Emuerhi alleged that the defendants sold the cocoa beans which were in their custody and converted the money to personal use. He said they were later arrested after investigation. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Sule-Amzat granted them N1.1 million bail each. She ordered that the defendants should provide two responsible sureties each as part of the bail conditions. One of the sureties, he said, should be a relation of the defendants and should be employed. The sureties are also to show evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on April 11.
