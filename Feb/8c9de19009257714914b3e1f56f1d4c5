Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been crowned Premier League manager of the month, becoming the first person in the Manchester United dugout to win the award since Sir Alex Ferguson. The 1999 treble hero has won nine of his first 10 matches in charge in all competitions, with United securing 10 of the 12 Premier League points available last month. That fine form saw him named January’s Barclays manager of the month ahead of Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl and Burnley’s Sean Dyche. It is the first time that a United manager has won the award since Ferguson in October 2012 – his final season and one that ended with the Premier League crown. Solskjaer celebrated his prize with his entire coaching team and posed for a photo with them while holding the award.
