The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) Bauchi branch has said it will not reduce the pump price for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from N145 to N140 per litre until it receives an order from the national body. The State Chairman of the Association, Alhaji Rabiu Ahmed Baba spoke on Tuesday while fielding questions from newsmen in Bauchi. He stated the branch may not comply as no official discussion has been held between the state branch and the national body. “Even if the branch receives such directive from our national body on the matter, the state branch will still have to convene an emergency meeting on whether to comply with the directive or not. “Already, independent petroleum marketers in the state have been selling petrol at N143 naira per litre as against the official pump price of N145 naira per litre,” he said. The National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Elder Chinedu Okworonko had earlier directed members of IPMAN nationwide to reduce petroleum pump price from N145 naira to N140 naira per litre following Saturday’s postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections to alleviate the plight of Nigerians who have traveled to their polling units to cast their votes before it was rescheduled.
