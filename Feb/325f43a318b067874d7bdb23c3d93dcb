Fenerbahce coach Ersun Yanal has refused to criticise Victor Moses over his performance in the first half against Besiktas in the Istanbul derby on Monday night. ”Football is a team sport, my speech at half-time was not the only reason. Everybody must show a reaction. We have players with international experience, we need them to react. I did not bring Moses or Isla out of the game because they played badly, the team needed a change,” Yanal said to Fenerbahce’s official website. In truth, Moses struggled for the first time since his arrival in Turkey but the Yellow Canaries gaffer has defended the Chelsea loanee, saying it was a tactical decision to change the left winger. Fenerbahce scored three goals in the space of 12 minutes in the second half as they came from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Besiktas at Vodafone Park. Moses has yet to go the distance in a Turkish Super Lig match since he debuted off the bench against Yeni Malatyaspor.
