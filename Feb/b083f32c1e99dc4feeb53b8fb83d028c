A Monday night inferno consumed not less than 25 shops at Ifesowapo Plank Market, Alekuwodo in Osogbo, Osun State. The chairman of the plank market, Abdul-Raheem Mutiu Adekunle, Ifelodun Plank Market and a member of the market association, Simeon Adeyemo, said nobody could explain the cause of the fire. Millions of naira worth of planks and equipment went in flame, according to victims. Two of the victims, Gboyega Oyeku and Solomon Oluponle Ilori, who lamented their losses, appealed to the state government to come to their rescue by re-establishing them. Narrating how they were called around midnight to come and rescue their wares from the inferno by good Samaritans, they said before they got to the market the fire was huge that it was impossible to salvage the situation. Men of the state Fire Service were said to have made frantic efforts to curtail the raging fire before its spread to the adjacent two-story building housing a mosque in the market. Governor Gboyega Oyetola was at scene of the inferno to console the victims. He promised support of the state government to cushion the adverse effect of the incident on the victims.
