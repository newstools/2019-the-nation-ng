According to him, “Mr. President is beyond parties as he has made adequate security arrangement for his visit to Benue State”. Speaking with reporters before the President’s arrival,  Ortom said: “Mr President is beyond party, he is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and whatever he is doing, it is our responsibility to give him adequate protocol. “He is our President, and he is beyond party and so, I am doing all that is necessary. “There is no special thing I am doing, what I am supposed to do as governor of Benue State irrespective of party because he remains my President and I respect him. “I have no personal issues with him; we talk about policies and issues, there is no personal grudge. “So, I am here to receive him, and I have made adequate arrangement. This state belongs to Mr President. So, he has access, he can be here and do whatever he wants.”
