The Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese, Most Rev. Dr. Paulinus Ezeokafor, has urged Nigerians to turn out en masse on Saturday to cast their votes and ensure their votes counted. He identified massive voting as one sure way to checkmating election rigging and manipulation of results in the country. The Prelate who spoke Friday at St. Patrick’s Catholic Cathedral, Awka, advised Nigerians to vote according to their consciences to ensure the emergence of credible leaders. He cautioned against vote-trading, insisting that such vices were inimical to the electoral process. “Vote buying and selling can only produce leaders who are not the collective wish of the people,” he said. Ezeokafor further asked politicians and their supporters to respect the constitution and play by the rules, stressing that election was not a do-or-die affair. He said, “Desperation and quest for political power should not be the primary reason for participating in an election but a desire to improve on the status quo if elected to serve the people. “Politicians should refrain from foul-languages, hate-speeches and campaigns of calumny but emphasize more on practical issues of development especially as it concerns poverty alleviation and job creation.”
