Former Ogun State Governor Segun Osoba has pleaded with members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to put behind them the attack on the party’s campaign rally in Abeokuta, the state capital, and ensure victory for its candidates, including Governor Ibikunle Amosun. Suspected political thugs believed to have been hired by loyalists of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) governorship candidate and the governor attacked the APC campaign rally in Abeokuta, pelting stones at dignitaries. Osoba, who expressed sadness that no arrest had been made, said he told the party’s supporters to leave vengeance to God and vote for all APC candidates. He said: “Ogun State is first in several areas. The leader of the progressives in this country is from that state and it is the home state of the Vice-President. I told the President that I apologised to him and that up till today, nobody has been arrested. I see that as a failure on the part of some elements of the security agencies. “Actually, the bulk of APC in Ogun State, we are one family. An instruction has gone out that in spite of what has happened, we should vote for APC candidates at all levels and when the result is out, it should reflect that. “At least, we should respect the Vice-President who is busy preaching welfarism for the down-trodden. I am sure that appropriate action will be taken on that issue later. “Yesterday (Sunday), I told stakeholders in Ogun State that on no account should anybody vote against Amosun. A governor is a governor and he will be in office till May 29. So, why are we worrying ourselves? “Amosun is just an individual. I still respect him as my governor up to May 29, this year, and I will not do anything to undermine him as governor.
