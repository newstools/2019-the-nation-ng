According to a source who witnessed the incident, “The boy, Monsuru Hamsat, who just finished his secondary education at St Luke’s College in Molete, Ibadan was shot down by the thugs which many residents believed belong to the group called ‘One Million Boys’. The eyewitness said that votes were being collated when the assailants came into Lanko Compound, Agbongbon Area of Ibadan, the same ward where Ambassador Arapaja voted and they started shooting sporadically which led to the death of Monsuru.” It was gathered that indications had earlier shown that there would be trouble when loyalists of one of the top five political parties in the state started removing the banners and posters of other parties in the vicinity and replacing them with those of their candidates.
