In its bid to enlighten Nigerians on the scourge of cancer, the Atinuke Cancer Foundation held a sensitisation event in Lagos on Saturday. Held at the Rafiu Jafojo Park, Shasha, the event featured a 5Km walk challenge, free medical check for 1000 persons including cervical cancer screening for women and aerobics. Participants also had got free T-shirts. And after a round of exercises, there was a walk from there to Dopemu Roundabout and back. Among those who led the procession which also included a large turn-out from members of the National Youth Service Corps was popular comedian Iya Mufu. She donned the campaign T-shirt with her signature headgear, over a wrapper and heavily rouged cheeks. And speaking in heavily accented Yoruba, Iya Mufu employed her comic side to sensitise residents as the walk progressed by sharing flyers. “Cancer is dead, we have killed cancer, I have killed cancer,” she chanted at several briefs stops. “You need to come and check yourself and know how to prevent cancer.” Atinuke Cancer Foundation aka Let’s Kill It, is an initiative founded by cancer survivor, Atinuke Lawal. In the past three years, the foundation has sensitised Nigerians on the need for early detection of cancer by encouraging checks and also promoting healthy lifestyles through talks and publications. “By creating awareness on prevention, early detection and treatment, we can save up to 3.7 million lives every year,” said Lawal. “Through raising the public and political literacy and understanding around cancer, we reduce fear, increase understanding, dispel myths and misconceptions, and change behaviours and attitudes. We are killing it!” The event was supported by Bet9ja, Vedic Lifecare Hospital, Clina-Lancet Laboratories, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos State AIDS Control Agency, LASPARK and FanMilk.
