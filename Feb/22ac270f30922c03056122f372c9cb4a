 Flying Eagles Tuesday failed in their bid to earn back to back victory at the ongoing African under 20 Nations cup in Niger and grab one of the four tickets to the FIFA under 20 world cup in Poland. The Paul Aigbogun tutored side that made an impressive start beating Burundi 2-0 in the opener, were held to a goalless draw by Amajita of South Africa. The South Africans who played a 1-1 draw against hosts Niger in the opener had put up spirited effort with intent to improving their chances but the flying Eagles held their ground but unfortunately failed to convert a few begging chances they created. Nigeria however still remain group leaders with 4 points in two matches but will have to wait till the last group match against Niger on Friday to seal qualification. All the four semifinalists will claim the four African slots for the World cup in Poland.
