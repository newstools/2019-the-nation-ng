Mr Norrison Quakers (SAN), counsel to former Minister of Aviation Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, Wednesday opposed a bid by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to tender some cheques as exhibits in the former minister’s money laundering trial. Fani-Kayode, Director of Publicity of the Goodluck Jonathan Presidential Campaign Organisation in 2015, is on trial with former minister of state for finance Mrs. Nenadi Usman at the Federal High Court in Lagos. They were charged with former Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) Chairman and ex-Chairman of Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Mr. Yusuf Danjuma, and a company, Jointrust Dimentions Nigeria Limited. The four were accused of violating the Money Laundering Act by indirectly retaining N300million, N400million and N800million, all proceeds of corruption, according to EFCC. The prosecution said they allegedly committed the offence, to which they pleaded not guilty, between January 8 and March 25, 2015 ahead of the 2015 general elections. An EFCC operative, Shuaibu Shahu, told Justice Rilwan Aikawa that part of the alleged laundered sums was transferred from the Ministry of External Affairs. For instance, he said N800 million was transferred from the ministry to Jointtrust Dimentions on January 16, 2015. He said there was no evidence that the firm executed any contract for the ministry. Shuaibu tendered some cheques used for the alleged fraudulent transactions. But the prosecution’s bid to tender more cheques was resisted by Quakers, who said he needed to confirm if they were part of the proof of evidence. Justice Aikawa adjourned until Thursday.
