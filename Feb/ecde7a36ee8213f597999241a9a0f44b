The senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo North District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice has raised alarm over assaults and attacks on his party members in Owo local government area and other parts of his senatorial district. Sources said the brazen attacks on APC members in Ondo North, particularly in Owo local government area, have forced many loyal party members to flee from their homes. Properties owned by APC members were attacked and some injured party members have been rushed to the hospital. Furthermore, many APC leaders in Owo LGA including serving members of the Ondo State House of Assembly have been issued death threats. It was learnt that the residence of Mukaila Musa in Iyere, Owo was attacked by gunmen on Thursday night. A statement by Boroffice’s spikesnan, Kayode Fakuyi said ” We understand that loyal APC members in Ondo North senatorial district are subjects of attacks because they have refused to work for the senatorial candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in Ondo North. It said “It is instructive to note the coordinated attacks on APC members have been linked to the supporters of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. “At this point, if the brazen intimidation and unprovoked assault on APC members persist, Senator Ajayi Boroffice cannot guarantee that there won’t be breakdown of law and order. “Finally, the Inspector General of Police is urged to provide adequate protection for APC members in Ondo North senatorial district. The Police should immediately assume full control of the internal security machinery of Ondo North senatorial district and Ondo State in general”.
