The Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday remanded in prison four men charged with producing adulterated engine oil. Justice Oluremi Oguntoyibo ordered that Johnson Uche, Olaide Shittu, Kingsley Meteke and Abdulquadri Olayinka be remanded, pending their arraignment. The Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) said the defendants and others at large on January 2, at 2, Esugbayi Street, NPA Quarters, Marine Bridge, Apapa, produced adulterated/substandard engine oil. They allegedly claimed that the products were genuine engine oil and sold them to motorists. The prosecution said the engine oil did not comply with mandatory industrial standard, an offence that violated Section 26 of the SON Act 2015. In the second count, the prosecution said the defendants, on the same day and place, “did indulge in dealing in and offering for sale adulterated/substandard engine oil.” SON said they claimed that the substandard product was genuine, contrary to Section 1 (18) (ii) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act of 2004. In the third count, the defendants were accused of dealing in 128 drums and 945 litres of substandard engine oil, which they claimed to be of high quality. In count four, they were alleged to have “failed to comply with SON Conformity Assessment Programme” by dealing in adulterated engine oil that did not have the requisite certification. The defendants were not arraigned because of their lawyer’s absence Prosecuting counsel Adeleke Olofindare, from the Federal Ministry of Justice, prayed that they be remanded in prison. Justice Oguntoyibo ordered their remand and adjourned till March 1 for arraignment.
