The leaders, who addressed hundreds of groups that converged on Abuja, took a swipe at politicians allegedly causing divisions within their fold. They insisted they would vote for Olawepo-Hashim on Saturday, saying their support remained unshakeable. The Middle Belt leaders include, among others, Air Commodore Dan Suleiman (retd.); Dr Musa Moda; Elizabeth Jibrin; Dr Emmanuel Enecheyo; Dr Ene; Captain Agada Joe (retd.) and Hon. Jonathan Asake. They said they had resolved to leave no stone unturned in actualising the political emancipation of the region. They claimed the reported Middle Belt endorsement of the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar was an attempt to divide the Middle Belt ahead of the presidential election. The coalition of other groups in the region led by Mr. Suleman Dauda Sukukum pledged to work assiduously for the success of Olawepo-Hashim . Dr. Moda described Olawepo- Hashim as a bridge builder and unifier of the Northern and southern Nigeria . He is the contemporary “amalgam of Northern and southern Nigeria,” he said. Excited Olawepo-Hashim appealed to Nigerians to remain peaceful and united even as he urged them to vote for a credible alternative that would uplift Nigeria to greater heights. Suleiman said the time had come for the Middle Belt to remain united and focused for the region to progress. According to him: “Recent happenings in the Middle Belt have indicated that there are moves to divide us.” He said the Middle Belt was dragged into supporting Atiku contrary to their earlier stand of supporting Olawepo-Hashim of the People’s Trust. Suleiman, however, expressed delight that many groups in the Middle Belt were now in the vanguard of propagating their political ideals and choices. He tasked them to move Middle Belt forward as well as encourage the unity and progress of the region.
