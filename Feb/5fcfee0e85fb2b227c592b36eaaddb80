The Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN), Lagos State Area Unit, said yesterday that it would sue an official of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), for allegedly slapping a pupil for refusing to remove her hijab during registration. Its Amirah (Female President), Hajia Basheerah Majekodunmi, who spoke to reporters during a briefing in Lagos to mark the World Hijab Day, condemned the incessant harassment and molestation of pupils in hijab. This, she said, had subjected some of them to emotional trauma. Majekodunmi said: “In the hands of government officials, especially teachers in public schools, our members are regular victims of physical and verbal assaults. The recent one being the slapping of a pupil at Ikosi High School, Lagos by an official of West African Examination Council (WAEC) for refusing to remove her hijab during registration. “WAEC authority has said that hijab did not affect registration of pupils. Why would an official of the examination body do such a thing? He was sent to register pupils and not to assault them. He will surely meet us in court. “Other hijab assault cases abound in  Agbede Community Grammar School,  Yewa Grammar School in Ikorodu and Iba Estate Senior High School in Ojo. We met the authorities of these schools and they apologised.” She lamented that despite the circular issued by the Lagos State Government and the judgment of the Appeal Court favouring the use of hijab, female Muslim pupils are still facing tough times in and outside the school premises. “When the Lagos State Government issued the circular, we thought relief had come, but it is utterly unfortunate that some school authorities and deviant teachers are working against the circular.
