The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the weekend made an intervention of $268.4 million in the retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) and CNY 46.3million in the spot and short tenored forwards segment of the inter-bank foreign market. This was disclosed by the apex bank’s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Isaac Okorafor, who revealed that the intervention was for requests in the agricultural and raw materials sectors. The Chinese Yuan, on the other hand, was for Renminbi denominated Letters of Credit. Okorafor further expressed satisfaction over the stability in the  foreign exchange market, which according to him, was largely due to sustained intervention by the bank. He assured that the bank would remain committed to ensuring that all the sectors of the forex market continue to enjoy access to the needed foreign exchange. Okorafor stressed that the CBN’s continued intervention was aimed at ensuring that the bank meets the requests of genuine customers in the various windows of the market. On the CBN’s restriction of access to forex for some 42 items, he said the policy would continue, particularly as it was greatly boosting local production of items on the list. He disclosed that the Economic Intelligence Unit of the CBN was working closely with relevant government agencies to checkmate any attempt to flout the policy. Meanwhile, $1 exchanged for N360 at the Bureau de Change (BDC) segment of the foreign exchange market, while CNY1 exchanged at N54.
