 World cup bound Super Falcons began their participation in the shape up Cyprus cup on a losing note after suffering a 4-1 defeat to Austria. Falcons managed to hold their opponents and maintain a goalless first half but conceded the first goal shortly after the resumption of second half. Toochukwu Oluehi had been handed a red as early as the 5th minute of the match which perhaps appeared to have taken the team aback. Nina Burger’s goal in the 48th minute for Austria served as a major ginger for the Austrians as Nicole Bila increased the tally in the 59th minute. Barcelona ladies forward Assisat Oshoala however raised hope for Falcons after she grabbed a 65th minute goal.  Falcons efforts at getting equaliser however failed to materialize rather it was Austrian ladies that scored two more goals in the 72nd and 84th minutes respectively thanks to Laura Felesinger and Jenifer Klein respectively. Austria thus leads the group with three points followed by Belgium who also won their match against 3-0 against Slovakia while Nigeria occupy the third place and Slovakia on the fourth place without no points. South Africa’s Bafana Bafana who are also participating in the competition were held to a 2-2 draw. In other matches played on Wednesday, Italy hammered Mexico 5-0, Korea DPR beat Czech Republic 2-1, while Thailand beat Hungary 4-0.  Falcons will on Friday file out against Slovakia in their second match. The Cyprus cup is part of the shape for the team ahead of the FIFA women world cup in France.
