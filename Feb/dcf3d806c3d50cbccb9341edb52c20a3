A political group, Buhari Support Organisation (BSO), yesterday expressed confidence that the Kwara State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, will win the March 9 election. It expressed optimism that APC candidates for the day’s House of Assembly election would be elected. In a statement yesterday in Ilorin, the state capital, by its State Coordinator Tajudeen Asunnara, BSO said: “We, therefore, implore you all to come out en masse to vote for our governorship candidate and all the House of Assembly candidates of our great party, the APC, on March 9 election. “We thank Kwarans for standing firm and showing love and total acceptability of President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term bid. Victory at the national level will only be meaningful if the state executive and legislature is being piloted by an APC government.” Also, addressing reporters in Ilorin on the re-election of the President, Asunnara said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declaration of President Buhari had silenced the opposition. He added: “President Buhari’s victory is a tacit approval of all the laudable programmes executed by our great party under the leadership of the President…”
