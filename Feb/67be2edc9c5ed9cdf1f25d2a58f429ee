The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State has petitioned the Commissioner of Police to investigate the murder of its members during last Saturday’s elections. A statement by the chairman, David Oghenekevwe, said the deceased members – Messrs Michael Chubiuke and Jeffrey Otevane – went to vote when they met their death. He accused Moses Ogodo, a House of Assembly candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his gang of masterminding their death. The statement reads: “Between 13:00hours and 14:00hours on February 23, at unit 15 ward 9, which is very close to Moses Ogodo’ residence, Ogodo and his cohorts came out armed with guns and other dangerous weapons. “According to an eyewitness, Ogodo shot and killed Michael Chubiuke, while Shaldrack Nebragho killed Jeffrey Otevane, and they continued to shoot sporadically. “This untoward behaviour is unacceptable; we condemn it and call on the Commissioner of Police and other security agents to bring the perpetrators to book. “Those who committed this crime are well known; we call on relevant security agencies to take necessary action and bring the culprits – Moses Ogodo, Shaldrack Nebragho and others to book.”
