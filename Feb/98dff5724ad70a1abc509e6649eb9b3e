Veteran Yoruba actor, Abudulsalam Sanyaolu, otherwise known as Charles Olumo or ‘Agbako’ was 94 years old on Tuesday. The actor had been off the screen for many years due to old age. Thus, when his birthday picture surfaced on the social media, many began to reminisce about his heydays as an actor. The thespian who started acting about 66 years ago, got the stage-name, ‘Agbako’, from one of the movies he featured in. One of the low moments for him was in 2013, when he was said to be sick and in coma. The actor who was also hospitalized in 2018 was said to be battling an undisclosed aliment. He had since not been going to movie locations, and has remained indoors, in his Abeokuta home, when not in hospital. In 2015, he was down with a stroke for six months. The same year, few days to his 90th birthday, he had an accident in his compound, wrecking his only car in the process.
