THE Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has decried the delays in the passage of budgets. At a briefing in Lagos, its  Director-General, Mr. Timothy Olawale, described as disheartening the  delays, noting that they were worrisome and had become major sources of concern to the private sector. Olawale said the importance of quick passage of budget could not be overemphasised, adding that budgets play a very critical role in economic development. He said: “Looking at the trend from 2014, the earliest time the budget was passed was in 2016 and that was in March. Nigeria’s fiscal year begins in January and ends in December; hence, we cannot begin to imagine the dire consequences of the late passage of the budget on national development and business growth. “In Ghana, for instance, the budget for the 2019 fiscal year was approved in November 2018; in Ethiopia, the budget for the 2018-2019 fiscal year was approved few days before the commencement of the fiscal year in July 2018. ‘’Similarly in Egypt, the budget for their 2018-2019 fiscal year was approved about a month to the commencement of the fiscal year. “The stability and predictability of the budgetary process of these countries could be one of the reasons they are becoming the new desired destination for foreign investments,” Olawale said. On some of the adverse effects of late passage of the budget, he said: “For some years, the process leading to the approval and passing of budget has always been a victim of the proverbial fighting of two elephants. “A critical component of the budget, such as capital expenditure, which, to a large extent, plays a major role in economic development, suffers. Infrastructural reforms, which are meant to attract investments and improve the lives of the populace, are put on hold and business decisions, which could translate to expansion and employment generation frustrated.”
