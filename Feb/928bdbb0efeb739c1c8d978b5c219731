The Edo State govern-ment will commence census of farmers across the 18 local government areas of the state. Mr Bashiru Kadiri, the Permanent Secretary, Edo Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resource, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Benin. Kadiri said the census would commence before the end of the first quarter, adding that it would enable government have data base of farmers and size of their farmlands. “The idea is to know the number of farmers in the state, what they grow, sizes of farmlands, where the farms are located, so that we can easily link them to investors, interventions and market access. “For instance, a cocoa processor can easily know where to get large quantities of cocoa pods from the farmers’ data base that will be created. “The data collected can also be used to know and project the tonnes of yields of various crops planted in the state. “In the next weeks, we will be done with the data collection,’’ he said. He said the state government recently entered a tripartite agreement with cassava processors and farmers to expand the cassava value chain in the state. “Farming is now a business and we are looking at the return on investment for our farmers. “Our cassava farmers suffer the problem of getting buyers for their cassava tubers, but the tripartite agreement will link the farmers to ready buyers,’’ he said.
