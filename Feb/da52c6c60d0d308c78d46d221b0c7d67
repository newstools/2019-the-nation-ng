At a meeting at the weekend, Shoyombo, Joint Association of Private Schools Owners of Nigeria (JAPSON) members, Ministry of Education officials and other stakeholders agreed that open day will be on Wednesday, while the first mid-term break is from Thursday to February 18. She said the second mid-term break would be from February 28 to March 4. The DG said  World Book Day is March 7, adding: “Since school activities fall in between the date for the general election, the adjustment becomes inevitable. Security is very paramount, to protect our children and avoid crisis during the elections,” she said. Shoyombo urged the association leaders to comply with the urgent adjustment to allow children stay away from school during the elections, for safety. She advised stakeholders to support the programmes that would raise the standard of literacy and promote educational development.
