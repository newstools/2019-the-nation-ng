They shot sporadically in all directions, leading to the death of a nineteen-year-old boy, simply identified as Usman, while a woman who was on the queue to cast her ballot was seriously injured. At Agbeji, thugs who invaded two polling unit tried to force the Presiding Officers (PO) to sign completed result sheets. The Pos, however, refused, and took to their heels, resulting in the disruption of the exercise. Meanwhile, in Igalamela-Odolu, Kogi East Senatorial district, the embattled state house of assembly member, Friday Makama, was reportedly abducted by persons disguised in police uniform.
