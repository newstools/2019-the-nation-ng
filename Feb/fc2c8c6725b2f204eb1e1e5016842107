LAGOS State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL) Acting General Manager Olalekan Ajani  has advised block moulders to be conversant with the standards and procedure of making quality sancrete blocks. He implored them to join professional associations such as the National Association of Block Moulders of Nigeria (NABMON) so that they can be regulated. Speaking yesterday while inspecting some block moulding firms in the state,  Ajani said the exercise was to ensure quality of building materials, especially sancrete blocks. Ajani, an engineer, who led a team comprising members of NABMON, to inspect some firms  in Eti-osa/Ibeju-Lekki, described sancrete block as the most important building material because of its load bearing nature. According to him,  it must be produced with quality components, comprising water, sharp sand, cement and granite dust in the right proportion.
