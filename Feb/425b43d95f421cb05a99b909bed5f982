BARELY a month into the cinema running of his first movie The Call, comedian, Oluwatoyin Bayegun known as Woli Arole, is set for another movie. Though he is yet to give the details of the new project, but a teaser of what to expect was uploaded on his social media handle where he was spotted with a crown with the caption, “Versatility is the hallmark of an actor. The birth of a new Kingdom, #KABIYES, I Oba Dekun 1, Kogberegbe 1, Dagboru, Watch out”. It will be recalled in January that Arole came out to say he was told that he could not succeed as a producer. So far, ‘The Call’ is the highest selling Nollywood movie in 2019. The graduate of Psychology from the Obafemi Awolowo University has made a brand of himself with his style of comedy which usually comes in prophetic ministrations.
