The Charles Bebeye Ndiomu Foundation has given scholarships to 23 children of some of dead members of the armed forces. A statement by the foundation’s spokesperson Theresa Orji, hailed the armed forces for their cooperation and assistance in the dissemination of information as well as collation and verification of the recipients. She said: “The foundation is happy to continue doing its part in ensuring that the children of our nation’s fallen heroes have access to education.” Orji expressed the foundation’s gratitude to the divisions of the armed forces involved in ensuring that the foundation’s objective for the awards is achieved from year to year. As with the previous awards, recipients of this year’s scholarships were selected across the country. The foundation was established in 2013 to immortalise Maj.-Gen. Charles Bebeye Ndiomu (CFR, FSS, MNI), who besides being a top officer, was also a philanthropist with passion for education and religion. Its mission is to ensure access to quality education for all in an environment where international best practice is the standard, an ideal Ndiomu stood for during his life.
