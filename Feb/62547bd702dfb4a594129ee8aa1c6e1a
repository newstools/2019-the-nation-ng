President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday apologized to Nigerians for the postponement of the 2019 general elections by one week. He felt bittered that many Nigerians must have spent their resources in moving from one location to the other towards voting in the postponement elections. Buhari, who returned to Abuja at 1:15 pm from Katsina State, spoke with journalists at the Presidential wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Asked why he was disappointed over the postponement of elections, he said “Yes I am disappointed because INEC has got all the time and resources needed and therefore supposed to work according to their programme. “They were given all the resources, they had all the time and they kept on telling us up to the last minute that they were ready. “The fact that they are not ready means there is some inefficiency along the line.” he said On his message to Nigerians and his supporters, he said “They should be patient, let them come out a week from today and vote. “I apologise for this inefficiency because they have to use their own resources to go back to their various polling units at their own expense if they are all that committed.” he said
