Lagos State Environment Commissioner Mr. Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti yesterday advised the public to view wetlands protection as a veritable solution to climate change. Wetlands are parts of the landscape that are defined by the presence of water. They are areas where the presence of water determines or influences most, if not all, of an area’s bio-geochemistry, that is, the biological, physical and chemical characteristics of a particular site. Durosinmi-Etti said wetlands should be seen as a means for conserving the environment for posterity. He said the World Wetlands Day, celebrated yearly on February 2, was designated by the United Nations to raise global awareness on the value of wetlands for humanity. This was, he said, with a view to encouraging the protection “of this invaluable natural resource.” He said this year’s theme of the World Wetlands Day: “Wetlands and climate Change”, was instructive as it is expected to  impel actions across the world against wetlands loss. Durosinmi-Etti said the wetlands loss was due to socio-economic pressures and climate change, among others. “The coastal state of Lagos, despite its blessing with enormous wetlands resources that can be relied upon to conserve nature and fight climate change, has for so long contended with the pressure of development. “The pressure of development is inexorably draining this vital natural gift,” he said in a statement. The commissioner said it had become necessary for stakeholders to collaborate for the protection of wetlands in the state and in particular Nigeria as a whole, considering the key roles played by wetlands in sustaining the environment.”
