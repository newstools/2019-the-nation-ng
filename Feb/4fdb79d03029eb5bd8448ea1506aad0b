A fire outbreak on Tuesday engulfed No. 2 Warri/Court Road, Sabon Gari, Kano destroying property worth millions at the third-floor of the storey building. According to an eyewitness account, the fire which started at about 3:30 pm razed down five flats in the third-floor and could have caused more havoc but for the timely intervention of men of the State Fire Service. A resident of the compound, who refused to give her name, said the fire broke out as a result of the carelessness of a banker occupant at flat 23 who did not put off the stove before leaving for work. She said: “The house girl confirmed to us that they forgot to put off the stove after preparing breakfast this morning. The stove was very close to the gas Cooker. “The fire from the stove ignited the gas cylinder which eventually exploded and caused the inferno. “As you can see, we have lost everything to the fire. Not even a pin was picked from the apartments. “We lost money, documents and properties. As I speak to you now, we are left with nothing, and only God knows where we are going to put our heads tonight.” However, residents hailed the Fire Service men for their prompt response to the distress calls and their commitment in putting of the fire, which would have ravaged the entire building. As at the time of filling in this report, our reporter, who visited the scene of the incident, saw a huge crowd discussing the incident in hush tones. Police and fire servicemen were busy putting the situation under control.
