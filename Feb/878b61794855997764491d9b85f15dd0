TWO unemployed men, Azeez Noath and Ife Akinyemi, have been brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing a Samsung phone valued at N140,000. Noath, 20, who lives in Saki, Oyo State and Akinyemi, 25, who resides in Egbeda, Lagos State pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti alleged that the defendants committed the offences on February 13, on Agege Motor Road, Mushin, Lagos. He said the defendants stole a Samsung Edge 6 phone belonging to the complainant, Mr. Samuel Ikegbu. “The defendants boarded the same tricycle with the complainant. While in transit, they commanded him to surrender his phone. “They also threatened that they would harm him. “For fear of the unknown, the complainant surrendered his phone to the defendants. As soon as they alighted from the tricycle, they took to their heels. “The complainant raised the alarm and passersby pursed them, caught them and beat them up mercilessly. “But the defendants were rescued by some policemen on patrol, who took them to a police station where the phone was recovered from them,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola granted the defendants N80, 000 bail with one surety each in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on March 6.
