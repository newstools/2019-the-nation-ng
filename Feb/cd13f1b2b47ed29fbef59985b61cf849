The Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has promised to vigorously follow-up the Lagos State bid to take over the National Stadium complex in Lagos. He made the assertion while on a special visit to the secretariat of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) Lagos chapter. Lagos State had submitted a bid in 2016 for full takeover of the 45-year old complex but it ended as failed proposal despite the fact that the ruling party in the state won the general election at the centre in 2015. He promised to give the sports sector a special boost if elected in the coming elections in Nigeria. Governorship election in the country holds on March 2. Sanwo-Olu said his visit was a continuation of sectorial consultation. This time, it is the sports sector. He said sports would be autonomous from the other sectors and separated for entertainment and effort would be made to ensure that the sector is self-driven to bring the best out of potentials that abound in the nooks and crannies of the state. “This sector deserves a special attention and we will ensure that the restive youths would be fully engaged in the rediscovery of their talents in the drive to bring back the old glory associated with the state at National Sports Festival. “Although I’m aware that other states poach athletes who have been groomed by Lagos state when national events come up, it is on record that Lagos do not need to do same because we have abundant talents who have been lured for monetary gains. “Lagos State Sports Commission will continue with its policies such as training grants to athletes and empowering the coaches with up-to-date knowledge of their respective events, while motivation of athletes will not be neglected,” he remarked.
