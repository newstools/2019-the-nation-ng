In his welcome speech, the convener of the Yoruba Heritage Group, Omo’ba Segun Adesemoye, stressed the importance of cultural rebirth and value reorientation among the Yoruba people. “The only way to economic independence and prosperity is for young people to engage in entrepreneurial activities and shift their focus from short routes that lead them to engage in criminal activities and later destruction,” he said. Also, Ambassador Akinboboye advised the Yoruba people to embrace their culture and explore the huge opportunities in tourism. He said, “We must take advantage of our advantage so that we can have an advantage.”
