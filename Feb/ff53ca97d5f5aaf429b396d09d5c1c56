Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday granted permission to a former Minister of State for Finance, Mrs. Nenadi Usman, to travel to the United States for medical treatment. He ordered that her international passport, in the court’s custody, be released to her. Mrs. Usman had traveled abroad previously in the course of her money laundering trial to receive treatment for breast cancer. The first time she traveled, she said doctors at the National Hospital recommended further treatment abroad after she had a relapse following a surgery. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arraigned Usman along with former Minister of Aviation Chief Femi Fani-Kayode. They were charge along with former National Chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) and ex-Chairman of Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Mr. Yusuf Danjuma and a company said to belong to him, Jointrust Dimentions Nigeria Limited. EFCC arraigned them on a 17-count charge of laundering about N4.6billion. They pleaded not guilty. On Thursday, Fani-Kayode’s lawyer, Mr. Norrison Quakers (SAN), resisted the attempt by the prosecution to tender a set of 108 Zenith Bank cheques as exhibits. The prosecuting counsel, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo, had sought to tender the cheques through the third prosecution witness, Shuaibu Shehu, an investigator with the EFCC. Oyedepo said the cheques were relevant to proving the allegations against Fani-Kayode. He said they were recovered by Shehu and his team while investigating the case. But Quakers urged the judge to reject them on the basis that they did not comply with Section 379 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 and the Practice Direction of the Federal High Court 2013. Justice Aikawa adjourned until March 15 for ruling.
