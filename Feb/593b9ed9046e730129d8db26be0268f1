President Muhammadu Buhari would rather wait for the result that will be declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rather than rely on rumours. He was dismissing the various results being posted on social media platforms in the aftermath of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly election. The President, who spoke on arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja from his Daura country home in Katsina, said he would wait for the final result declaration by INEC. Buhari left Abuja on Friday for Daura, Katsina State, in order to exercise his civic responsibility. Asked his reaction to news  from across the country, he said: “I don’t want to depend on rumours, but we will rather wait for INEC to announce the results.” On his message to Nigerians as they await the release of the results, Buhari said: “Well, l hope that Nigerians will appreciate that it was this government which made sure that they were allowed in security and peace to cast their votes for whichever party and candidates they wanted.” The Co-Chairman of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed TInubu expressed optimism that ruling party will win.
