A cross-section of Enugu parents have expressed happiness over the suspension of the three months strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Some parents, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria in Enugu, on Saturday, expressed joy that their children would be resuming school after months of uncertainty about their future. Mr Ikonye Egbuna, a civil servant, said his joy knew no bounds when he heard the news that the strike had been suspended by the leadership of ASUU. According to Egbuna, his two children that are in the university are tired of staying at home with nothing tangible to do. Another parent, Mrs Evelyn Ezeaba, a businesswoman, said that she was happy over the development because her son had been worried over the delay in calling off the strike so he could resume school. “Infact, I thank God because now my son can resume studies and I can have peace of mind that he would not fall into the wrong hands because of idleness,’’ Ezeaba said. Mrs Ekwy Onuigbo, a widow, commended ASUU for the wise decision it took to call off the strike, adding that it had not been easy with many parents who were struggling to make ends meet. Onuigbo said parents expected timely completions of their children’s studies so they could graduate and find work to lessen the burden on the parents. She said he incessant strikes by lecturers in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions had become worrisome because it was adversely affecting the future of children who were being denied the opportunity to be at par with their counterparts globally. Mr Romanus Umeohia, another parent called on the Federal Government not to fail in its promises to ASUU in order to forestall any misunderstandings that could lead to disruption of academic activities. Some students who also spoke to NAN expressed joy at the decision by ASUU. NAN reports that ASSU had on Thursday announced its decision to call off the protracted strike which paralysed activities in Nigerian universities.
