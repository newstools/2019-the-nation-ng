The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State has accused Governor Ibikunle Amosun of discreetly working to undermine President Muhammadu Buhari in the Presidential and National Assembly elections rescheduled for Saturday. In a statement on Thursday in Abeokuta by Publicity Secretary of Ogun State APC Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, the party alleged Amosun was to reduce the margin of the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in Ogun East and Ogun West Senatorial Districts in a vainglorious attempt to send a wrong signal of his popularity in Ogun State and undermine the Vice President. The statement reads: “We have at our disposal, confirmed intelligence reports that Governor Amosun has been holding nocturnal and clandestine meetings in the last three weeks with a failed governorship Aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) whose father is a renowned betting agent. “The purpose of the meetings is to work against APC at the Presidential and National Assembly elections. “The objective, for which the governor distributed the sum of N200, 000 per polling booth last week, before the postponed elections, was to ensure that President Buhari loses the election or to drastically reduce the margin of his victory in the two Senatorial districts, especially in Ogun East, where the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, hails from. “It would be recalled that the failed governorship aspirant recently, without any justification whatsoever, took to the mass media to disparage the Vice President, blaming him for his woes arising from the loss of the PDP’s governorship ticket, only for the same aspirant to turn around few days after to contradict himself with a boast that INEC would soon name him as his party’s candidate”. The party added: “Governor Amosun is insisting on the posting away of some corps members in Ogun West Senatorial District where he is sponsoring an APM candidate against his former Chief of Staff, Chief Olu Odebiyi, who is of the APC. “The party is using this medium to ask the Presidency to tame Governor Amosun before he sets Ogun State on fire over his egoistic and moribund self-preserving ambition.”
