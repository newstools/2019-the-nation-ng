Traditional rulers in Ijebu land have described the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Senator Buruji Kashamu, as a beloved son of Ijebu land. Two monarchs – the Lamodi of Ijebu-Isiwo, His Royal Highness, Oba Sikiru Adedoyin and the Aladeken of Oke-Ako in Ijebu-Ode Local Government Area, His Royal Highness, Oba Joshua Osunsami (J.P) – spoke when Kashamu visited them at their palaces. They hailed the senator for his foresight to put key policies and programmes in an undertaking, which he has been giving to traditional rulers across the state. In the undertaking, which he elaborated on, Kashamu promised to allow local governments to enjoy full financial autonomy without deducting from their monthly allocations. This, he said, would engender grassroots developments. The senator also committed himself to addressing the issues of cooperative deductions and contributory pensions without a view to allowing the will of the workers to prevail. The PDP candidate also said Micro Small Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMSEs) would be encouraged to thrive through the facilitation of microfinance and community banks that would advance revolving facilities to entrepreneurs at zero interest rate.
