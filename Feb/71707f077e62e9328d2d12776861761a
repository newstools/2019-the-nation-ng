Three Nigerian films – Lionheart, King of Boys and Up North – will be showcased at the second edition of Nollywood in Hollywood. The two-day event will begin with a red carpet and screening at the prestigious American Cinematheque’s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood on March 22. Two more screenings will follow the next day at the world’s premiere film education institution, the school of cinematic Arts, University of Southern California. As a testament to the achievements of Nigerian women in the film industry, women directed the selected films. “That’s simply amazing,” says Maceo Willis, the event’s director of operations. “In Hollywood, we struggle with diversity and inclusion. These powerful female voices from Nigeria are showing Hollywood how it’s done. Last year, we had a very successful debut. We believe these remarkable films will be great representatives of Nollywood.” Lionheart is the directorial debut from Nollywood’s top actress, Genevieve Nnaji.  Kemi Adetiba, the Nigerian queen of the box office, is the director of King of Boys while Up North is directed by Tope Oshin Ogun, one of Nollywood’s most versatile directors. Nollywood in Hollywood is co-presented by 02A Media, Inc. and two Hollywood giants – The American Cinematheque and the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. The brainchild of Nigerian-American filmmaker, Ose Oyamendan, the event is designed to introduce Nigerian cinema to Hollywood, bridge the gap between two of the largest film industries in the world and create a platform for collaborations and trainings.
