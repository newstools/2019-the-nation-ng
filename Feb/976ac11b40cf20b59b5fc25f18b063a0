Security agents reportedly saved an ugly situation Saturday at Afin-Akoko in Ondo state, where hoodlums matcheted a party agent, Idowu Olorunfemi. The hoodlums allegedly snatched a ballot box and went away with money meant for the party agents. They were said to have escaped in a gulf car before soldiers, combined team of police men and civil defence trailed them. They abandoned the car and ran into the bush. The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Okeagbe, a Superintendent of Police (SP) Ibitayo Adetaranmi could not be reached for comments. However, the victim was on a danger list at an undisclosed hospital. Dangerous weapons like gun cutlasses were retrieved from the abandoned vehicle.
