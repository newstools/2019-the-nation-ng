Edo State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosun, has declared that investigation into the missing phone saga that led to pepper being inserted in the vagina of a female sex worker showed that no phone was actually missing. The sex worker identified as 24 years old Favour Ada Friday was beaten and  stripped naked by her accusers and raw pepper inserted into her vaginal despite her repeated denial that she didn’t steal any phone. She was beaten after a native doctor through magical means said she was the person that stole the phone. Three persons including head of vigilance group in Ugbiyoko community, Mr. Lucky Igbinovia popularly known as One Man squad, Joel Otoghile and Iyamu Kingsley have been remanded in prison custody over the saga. Odumosun who spoke while addressing female protesters led by the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) and Edo State Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, said the victim was accused of stealing the phone just to extort money from her. He assured the protesters that the police would carry out thorough investigation to ensure the case is not thrown out by any judge. Chairperson of FIDA, Barr. Iryn Omorogiomwan, urged the CP to ensure investigations are expedited so that all the suspects are convicted if found guilty. Edo State First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, said the crime against Favour shocked human conscience and would not be tolerated by Edo people. Mrs. Obaseki said her husband was very upset and angered by the incident. Governor Godwin Obaseki who immediately signed the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) bill into law assured that law would take its course. Obaseki condemned the action and said his administration would not cover anybody no matter how highly placed.
