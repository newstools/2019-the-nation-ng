The Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reform (CODER) has said it has been granted accreditation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to monitor the 2019 Presidential, National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly elections. It said to fulfill this mandate, it has trained 380 field observers and deployed them to their assigned states since February 14. CODER, which was founded in 2009 by a coalition of individuals and organisations committed to supporting the electoral reform process in Nigeria, stated this in a statement to The Nation yesterday. The statement explained that the organisation is currently undergoing a restructuring process led by its Executive Director and Chairman of the Transitional Committee Dr. Wunmi Bewaji. According to the non-governmental group’s convener, Chief Ayo Opadokun, CODER’s objective is very simple: “to ensure that every vote counts”. The letter added: “Since the first phase of the struggle for electoral reform concluded with the enactment of far-reaching reforms initiated by the late President Umaru Yar’Adua, following the recommendations of the Uwais Committee, CODER has continued to be in the forefront of safeguarding the electoral process by participating in election observation activities, as well as educating and engaging voters. “Each election cycle, many Nigerians have relied on POLLWATCH, the CODER election reporting platform, for up-to-date, verified election reports. #NigeriaDecides2019 will not be different.”
