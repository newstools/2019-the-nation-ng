The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) has  blamed the rising unemployment rate on the lack of requisite skills among youths. Speaking with The Nation, its Director-General, Mr. Joseph Ari, said  there were many job vacancies that were waiting for skilled manpower. Reports from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), have, over the years, indicated a worsening unemployment rate, with the figure rising to 15.99 million in the third quarter of last year. Ari said: “Based on a skills gap assessment survey in the six priority sectors of the economy, conducted by the ITF in collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), vacancies exist in all sectors. “The unfortunate truth is that the vacancies are always filled by non-Nigerians, because the unemployed Nigerians lack the requisite skills. From our survey, 925 trades have been difficult and hard to fill in the country’s labour market. “Our survey showed that 19.5 per cent vacancies are yet to be filled in the housing sector while the petrochemical sector has more than 13.9 per cent vacancies waiting for skilled workers. “The auto sector has 11.4 per cent vacancies, while 10.3 per cent vacancies are still available in the textiles sector,” he explained. Other areas he said, include steel, 10.1 per cent, service, 8.9 per cent, while the leather sector has 3.3 jobs waiting for the right workers. He said 15.7 per cent of all the hard-to-fill vacancies were due to lack of technical skills, and 11.8 per cent were due to lack of basic Industrial Training (IT) skills. According to him, 9.2 per cent of the vacancies are due to lack of advanced IT skills, while 9.2 per cent and 7.5 per cent of the vacancies are yet unfilled because of the lack of requisite soft skills.
