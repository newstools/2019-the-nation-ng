Veteran actor, Richard Mofe Damijo, while reminiscing on how far some of Nollywood actors have gone, showered praises on his co-actor Genevieve Nnaji. Posting a clip from one of the movies they both featured in, the actor wrote: “Who remembers this one with @genevievennaji? We didn’t know how far this Enterprise was going to take us but we kept the faith…. didn’t fake it. Pure, organic, Told our stories the best way we knew how. Mostly from a place of our truth; look at us now.” Reacting to the post, one of the actor’s followers, @edenattai, wrote, “Funny but “Keeping Faith” (this is not it o) is my fav all time movie of both of you. My mom bought it in church thinking it was a Christian movie and just cos @genevievennaji face was on it. You could use Gene’s face to sell anything to my mom. Love you both like Kilode #sass and #charm.” The actress’ latest work, ‘Lion Heart’ which is on Netflix, has since its release, been getting positive reviews.
