A soldier and two civilians were feared dead on Wednesday when Boko Haram fighters ambushed the convoy of Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima during a campaign in Borno North. A credible source from the convoy confirmed the incident to our correspondent in Maiduguri. He said the convoy was attacked along Gajibo in Dikwa Local Government of Borno State. The source revealed Shettima escaped unhurt because the incident occurred at the tail end of the long convoy. The governor and others were said to have driven past before the attack. “It’s very unfortunate that the Boko Haram boys took advantage of the long convoy and attack at the end of the convoy. By the time the incident happened, the Governor has already passed,” he explained. Speaking on fatality, the source disclosed: “Only three people died-one soldier and two other civilians. We are just returning into Maiduguri now,” he said. Another competent security source confirmed the casualty was three, adding many persons also sustained various degrees of injuries in the attack. “Governor Kashim Shettima’s convoy was attacked on Wednesday and those that were killed are members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) that were far behind. “The Governor and other top politicians escaped unhurt. But many other persons were injured,” the sources informed. The Special Adviser, Media and Strategy, Malam Isa Gusau could not be reached for comment at the time of filing the report.
