A 27-year-old commercial driver, Mashudu Rabiu, yesterday appeared at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos for allegedly stealing three articulated vehicle carcases recovered from notorious kidnapper, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, aka Evans. The police charged Rabiu, whose residential address was not provided, with two counts of conspiracy and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Raphael Donny alleged that the defendant conspired with others at large, and stole three trailer carcases valued at N10. 5 million, which were recovered by the police as exhibits from the kidnap kingpin. Donny said the defendant committed the offence on December 10 last year at 3am at Amuwo Odofin, Lagos. He said the defendant conspired with the guard and stole the carcases. The defendant, he alleged, was arrested in Katsina and brought back to Lagos to face his charges. The offence, he said, contravened sections 287 and 411 of the 2015 (Revised) Criminal Law of Lagos State. Chief Magistrate B. O. Osunsemi admitted the defendant to N2 million bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed with evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified by the court. Osunsemi added that they must live within the court’s jurisdiction and adjourned the case till March 23.
