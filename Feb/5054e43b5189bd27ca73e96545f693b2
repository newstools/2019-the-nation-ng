The Committee for the Defence of the Human Right (CDHR), Akwa Ibom State Chapter, has urged security agencies to be non-partisan if the generally elections are to be a success. It said any person or group intending to disrupt the peace during the elections and thereafter should be dealt with according to law irrespective of party affiliations. In a statement by its state chairman Comrade Pius Philip Ntuen, the group condemned the burning of buses conveying electoral materials and the alleged killing of innocent persons in Obot Akara Local Government Area. “We urge all political parties, their supporters and agents to maintain peace, caution their agents and advise their supporters to eschew violence and ensure peaceful elections in Akwa Ibom State. “We also call on security agencies to maintain absolute neutrality, total impartiality and complete objectivity expected of them under the law to reinforce the confidence reposed in them by the teeming electorate for peaceful and credible elections in Akwa Ibom State,” CDHR said. It urged the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Mr Mike Igini to maintain his impartiality and neutrality.
