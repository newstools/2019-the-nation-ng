There is tension in Akwa Ibom as Coalition of political parties has kicked against some moves by All Progressives Congress party (APC) to deploy the Resident Electoral Commissioner Mike Igini. Addressing a press conference in Uyo on Tuesday under the aegis of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), the Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) and the conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP), said there were disturbing attempts by the opposition political party in the state to impugn the integrity of  Igini. The parties  also noted the opposition groups in the state never raised concerns about the REC’s integrity but only resorted to blackmail when attempts to make him compromise in the performance of his duty failed. “We are however worried that the opposition just like other parties should be glad that there is an umpire in Igini’s mould who is committed to ensuring credible, free and fair elections by seeking ways of multiplying such reputation in the commission rather than work to have him conform especially in this era when Nigerians have grown an all-time-high electoral consciousness,’’ the parties stated. The state chairman of the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) and publicity secretary of IPAC Mr Aniebiet Emmanuel said the protest staged by the opposition in the state was “an attempt to blackmail the electoral umpire for refusing their advances to rig the polls in their favour, a move that was designed to corroborate the outburst from Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).” According to him: “Our position is that INEC should refuse sacrificing her independence to assume appendage roles to men who rather than work for the common good of the nation are bent on destroying what is left of our national fabrics for their personal gains.” The chieftains of political parties and their governorship candidates said they have resolved to defend the nation’s democracy and principles of free choice by ensuring nothing untoward is imported into the conduct of the forthcoming election. According to them, they have promised to abide by the rules of engagement and would stoutly oppose and frustrate every plot aimed at derailing the peaceful conduct of the 2019 polls.
