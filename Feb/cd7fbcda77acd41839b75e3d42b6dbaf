The Ikale community in Lagos is backing the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, in the Merch 9 governorship election. Addressing reporters in Surulere Lagos Mainland after a meeting with Sanwo-Olu, the Coordinator, Ikale in Lagos for BOS, Otunba Sola Olatunji, hailed the government beginning from the  days of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, had done well in the past 16 years. He said Lagosians should vote for the APC candidates during the governorship and house of assembly elections on March 9. Olatunji hoped that over 75 per cent of the Ikale scattered across Lagos would vote for Sanwo-Olu. He said: “We are over two million Ikale living in Lagos, spanning about five to six generations. We are not new to Lagos politics and we believe it is time to make our support known. Mind you, because we are progressive in minded people, we are doing this to show our support for the development of Lagos. “This is a state that is pursuing the smart city status. Lagos needs a smart and intelligent person to lead and we see Sanwo-Olu as that man who can continue in the development stride.”
