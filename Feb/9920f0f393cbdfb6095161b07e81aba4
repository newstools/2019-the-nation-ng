Benson Idahosa University Leadership 300 (L300) with Life Success Centre (LSC), has held its business fair for students. The event aimed to give potential student entrepreneurs the opportunity to showcase and sell their products to the public. It was also an avenue for the young entrepreneurs to network, generate maximum exposure and embrace entrepreneurship. Benson Idahosa University Life Success Centre coordinator,  Alex Osagie, who spoke at the fair, said the initiative was designed to steer students’ minds towards entrepreneurship and good leadership. He enumerated that entrepreneurship would help unlock potentials, so that students would become self-employed upon graduation. Excited about the prospect, Benson Idahosa University President, Bishop F.E.B Idahosa, who graced the fair, said the exercise aimed at providing a handshake between students and the business world. According to him, the entrepreneurship fair would also teach students how to do business in all sectors in the society. He said: “We want to let each of them know that as they start a business from here, they can grow to become CEO’S and organisational heads.” He urged the potential student entrepreneurs to differentiate themselves in whatever business they have ventured into. On her part, the Director of CAMPUSLIFE Division, Rev. Laurie Idahosa, said the aim is for the students to learn entrepreneurship while they are in school, so that they can experience the joy of making their own money as well as learn from their shortcomings. “They will also learn from their lectures on how to run their businesses because in today’s economy, it is important we have multiple streams of income,” she said. The Life Success Centre (LSC) is a career training centre that helps to train, equip and challenge young, final year students the institution tagged:“Benson Idahosa University executives”. The primary responsibility of LSC is to prepare the students with requisite skill for success in life after school.
