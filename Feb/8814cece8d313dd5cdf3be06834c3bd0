Two persons were yesterday arraigned before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court for posing as lawyers to defraud some potential tenants. Taiwo Alatise, 53, and Abiodun Olatoye, 67, were charged with conspiracy, stealing, obtaining under false pretences, forgery and being in possession of false documents. They pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Kehinde Omisakin said the defendants committed the offence on January 16, at Ilupeju, Lagos. She alleged that Alatise and Olatoye obtained N880,000 from Lamidi Adenuga and Abidemi Mustapha on the pretext of renting a three-bedroom flat to them. Omisakin said the defendants also presented themselves as lawyers in charge of the flat at Ilupeju and were found in possession of false documents. “They also forged a letterhead and logo showing them as lawyers and property consultants, which they used in defrauding the public,” she alleged. Chief Magistrate A.O. Komolafe admitted the defendants to N250,000 bail with two sureties each in the like sum. The case continues on March 7.
