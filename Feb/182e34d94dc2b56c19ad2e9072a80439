A mobile phone brand, Infinix, said it is prepared for the competition that will mark the mobile phone ecosystem this year. In a statement, it said it has established itself as Africa’s biggest intelligent smartphone makers through a series of product sale campaigns and expertly executed user engagement activities. “In a stiffly competitive market such as the smartphone industry that constantly witnesses a towering influx of new entrants, all claiming to have the best products with an undeniable IT factor that would shake up the market in their favour, it has almost become a case of everyone’s talking and the one who makes the most noise automatically becomes the one that amasses a larger consumer base,” it said. Upon entry into the Nigerian smartphone market in 2012, it said it identified a severe lack within the system and proffered a sustainable solution, which was utilising a feedback system to understand the smartphone needs of its target audience and then craft smartphones that embodied a delicate fusion of futuristic technology and fashion to suit the lifestyle of young people. Infinix smartphones have always symbolised optimum efficiency and technological acumen. However, the era of the intelligent smartphone was officially ushered in by the launch of the “Beyond Intelligent” Note 5 smartphone in June 2018 that showcased the dexterity of Artificial Intelligence with its A.I camera that can automatically pick the best settings for high quality images with milliseconds.
