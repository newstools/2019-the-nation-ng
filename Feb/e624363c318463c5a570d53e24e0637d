Market women in Oshodi have called on government at all levels to ensure access to affordable healthcare services for the masses. They spoke at the ongoing free medical service provided by the Lagos All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The market women urged Sanwo-Olu to ensure continuity of the free medical programme if elected into office. They lamented most market women cannot afford the huge costs of treatment in the hospitals in the state. One of them, Mrs. Iyabo Akinpelu, said continuity of the programme will to a large extent help the market women to maintain healthy lifestyle. The free medical programme is sponsored by the Prime Group, LMC for BOS and others. The programme included general consultation, breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, dental services, optometry services and others. The programme, which took place at the Resettlement market in Oshodi, witnessed provision of free eye glasses to hundreds of the women. There was also provision of free drugs for ailments such as high blood pressure, malaria and others.
