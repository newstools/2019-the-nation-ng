Georgia Oboh finally showed her class at the inaugural Serengeti Team Golf Championship in Johannesburg, after the Nigerian teenage sensation finished among the top four at the two-day tournament. Oboh who missed the cut in the Canon Ladies Open last week bounced back with the top four finish with her partner – Catherine Lau of South Africa. The pair started out slow in round one on Tuesday and lay in 14th position with a modified format earning 38 points in a four ball better ball format which meant the pair were scored based on the lowest score per hole. They played a combined card of 3 under par for the day/ However, on the final day on Wednesday February 6, the duo found their form with an early birdie on the first hole and they never took their feet off the pedal, rolling in 8 birdies en route a score of 8 under par and score of 44. The pair narrowly missed out on the winners’ trophy by just two points, which was an indication that Oboh’s game is getting stronger with each tournament. France’s Marion ‘Fire’ Duvernay and Flora ‘Ice’ Peuch were untouchable to claim the winners’ trophy. From the first round, the French duo racked up no less than seven birdies and fired two eagles at the Jack Nicklaus Signature Course at Serengeti Estates. A total score of 46 points propelled Duvernay and Peuch to the top of the leaderboard and they held on to the final round to emerge as champions. Oboh continues her tour in South Africa for her third tournament, which is the prestigious Data Dimensions tournament at the George Golf Club and Fancourt Golf Clubs featuring both men and ladies and including Nigeria’s number one – Oche Odoh.
