Ahead of Saturday’s election, singer, actor and record label owner, Olubanke Wellington, who is campaigning to represent Eti Osa Constituency in Lagos at the Federal House of Assembly, has organised a concert for his constituents. The concert, tagged ‘Stronger Together’, held at Muri Okunola Park, Victoria Island, Lagos. It was free to everyone who has a Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC). The artiste who is popularly known as Banky W took to Instagram to share the information. “The #StrongerTogether Concert is now loading,” wrote Banky W on Sunday evening. “Gates open in a few minutes… come on down to Muri Okunola park in VI with your PVC (Or TVC) and it is completely free… We will also have our team from @leadnurseafrica on ground doing free medical checkups. Hope I will see y’all there? #MDP #StrongerTogether #BankOnBanky.”
