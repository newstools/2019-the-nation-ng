The Lagos State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says most public hospitals have been equipped with facilities for emergency response in case of crisis during the general election, which starts tomorrow. Its Chairman, Dr. Saliu Oseni, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday said the association had stimulated its members to be at alert for quick response to emergencies during the elections tomorrow and on March 9. He urged candidates to carry out peaceful and smooth elections. “Prevention is better than cure, is what we say. When you have crisis, we do not know the extent to which it can go. “The setup of some general hospitals in Lagos always has provisions for crisis management, where you have mass casualties. “However, we appeal to our politicians to hold the election in a peaceful environment, putting into consideration the people they want to lead so that the people can be in safe hands. “We also need the unity of the country at this time,” Oseni said. He urged individuals, especially the youth, not to allow themselves to be used as thugs to foment crisis.
