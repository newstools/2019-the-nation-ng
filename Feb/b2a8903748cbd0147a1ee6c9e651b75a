The accident was said to have occurred at 9.30 a.m on Monday at a village called Dinyarmadiga in Takai Local Government Area. The Council’s Information Officer, Nasiru Abu Faragai said that the accident involved a VW Sharon bus with registration number, BUJ 389 AA-Jigawa and Toyota Sienna with registration number YLA 389 PK-Adamawa. He said the VW Sharon bus from Jos heading to Kano was on high speed and trying to dodge a pothole in the process veered into the lane of the Toyota Sienna coming from Kano heading to Yola, Adamawa state. “The two vehicles had head-on collision and the driver of the Toyota Sienna died on the spot with eight other passengers.” The injured were immediately taken to Takai general hospital for treatment.
