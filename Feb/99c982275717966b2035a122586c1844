Barely 12 days to what has been dubbed mother of all elections in Nigeria, former Super Eagles goalkeeper turned pastor, Peterside Idah has taken the case of Rivers state in particular to God, reminding youths in the state that no political party is worth their blood. An apparently worried Idah took to his twitter handle on Monday to pour out his mind on one hand and express his fears on the other ahead of the elections billed for February 16 and March 2nd respectively. “Oh God help our state rivers state. the elections are back on and the gates of blood has just be opened again. I beg and ask the youth no political party deserves your blood. I beg you “he pleaded. Idah who is pastor of South African based Christ Ambassadors Church, retired from active football in 2002 and has since been engaged by Supersports as part of its team of analysts. Idah who recently welcomed a baby after 10 years of marriage it will be recalled came very hard on Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr after the team posted unimpressive run a the World Cup in Russia. He particularly condemned Rohr’s emphasis on his team being the youngest insisting that teams and coaches go to the world cup to prove themselves and be counted and not give excuses. Rohr has since overcome the disappointment of the world cup and has earned a ticket to the 2019 AFCON in Egypt with a game to spare against Seychelles in March. Some say the German tactician who recently ruled out retirement in his plans for now, will need to make a statement at the Nations cup especially after Nigeria missed two editions in a roll.
