Ahmed Musa has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election. On Wednesday morning, the 76-year-old politician was declared the winner of the February 23 Presidential election by the Independent National Electoral Commission [INEC] after defeating his closest rival Atiku Abubakar. Buhari of All Progressives Congress polled 15,191,847 votes while Atiku of the Peoples Democratic Party garnered 11,262,978 votes. Following the victory, the Super Eagles’ and Al Nassr forward has taken to the social media to felicitate with the President. “Congratulations to my president Muhammadu Buhari,” Musa posted on Instagram. Musa who joined the Global last summer from Premier League side Leicester City, has scored five goals in 15 league appearances for his Saudi Arabia side. The fleet-footed forward will hope to impress when Al Nassr takes on Al Shabab in their next league game on Thursday.
