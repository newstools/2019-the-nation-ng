An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos yesterday granted a 51-year-old travel agent, John Osehaenyi, N100,000 bail, following his arraignment for alleged N300,000 visa scam and forgery. Magistrate M. I Dan-Oni ordered Osehaenyi to provide a surety, who must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned till March 7. Osehaenyi pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada alleged that the defendant committed the offence on October 15, last year, in Ikeja. He said the defendant collected N300,000 from Mr. Ayodele Ajenifuja on the pretext of helping him to procure a Canadian visa, but failed to do so. “Osehaenyi forged a Canadian Embassy’s appointment letter for biometric capturing dated January 9 and presented it to Ajenifuja. It was later discovered to be forged. “Attempts by the complainant (Ajenifuja) to collect his money proved unsuccessful, as the defendant refused to pick calls. “He reported the case to the police, and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said.
