It was a free-fall for Nigerian players in the latest ranking of the Professional Squash Association (PSA) after the world body released its latest ranking. But the only consolation for the country came from Nigeria female number one, Yemisi Olatunji who gained six steps up in the rating to be ranked 146 in the world. From her January 2019 152nd place, Olatunji rose to 146 following her exploits toward the end of the 2018. In the PSA Men’s World rankings, Babatunde Ajagbe fell six places to World No. 194 in the February rankings. The US-based player occupied the 188th spot in the January rankings. The 31-year old current position is unconnected with inactivity in January. Ajagbe who achieved his highest career ranking of 144 on December, 2014 share the spot with Britain Elvinn. Likewise, Idowu Enimakure slipped thirty-five places from the 475th position in the January to 510th spot, while Enimakure shares the position with seventy-five other players around the globe. Furthermore, Adegoke Onaopemipo who in January sat at the 388th position dropped eighteen places to 406th spot. Abdulrahman Yusuf also dropped six places from No. 279 to No. 283 in the world. However, Adewale Amao who started 2019 on a bright note, did not move up or down in the rankings. The US-based player maintained the 253 position in the world squash which was the same spot he occupied in January. Meanwhile, Olatunji’s sibling – Busayo slipped four places from No. 223th in January to No. 227th and she shared the position with England’s Katie Wells.
