A stage adaptation of the book, Afonja –The Rise, by Tunde Leye, was recently staged at the Musson Center, Lagos, with stakeholders in the entertainment industry emphasising the relevance of the play to modern-day leaders. The play chronicles the struggle for supremacy between Alaafin Arogangan and Afonja, capturing the story of a onetime Aare Ona Kakanfofo –Afonja, who was believed to have wrecked the Oyo Empire. Ahead of the stage play, scholars, historians and culture enthusiasts unearthed the rot in the culture and entertainment industry at a round table discussion. The debate was hinged on how history and African culture are going into extinction. Speakers, including ace filmmaker, Tunde Kelani, a former lecturer in the department of history at the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Ijanikin, Lagos, Mrs. Elizabeth Ajayi and a former Attorney General of Lagos State, Dapo Sasore SAN, appealed to parents and other stakeholders in Yoruba nation not to allow western culture to undermine African culture in their respective homes. Kelani expressed concern that sites such as Old Oyo, Osogun, Koso and Bara now lie in ruins, saying that nothing was done to preserve such heritage. He further noted that parents, guardians and everybody has a role to play in teaching the young history and culture.
