The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Lagos state chapter has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and National Leader of the All Progressives Party (APC) for the resounding success at last Saturday’s presidential election. It said Buhari’s victory was more than deserving praising Tinubu for his strategic efforts in the re-election bid. Chairman of the association, Comrade Busari AbdulQowiyy, in a statement, wished the President “success and strength in continuing to perform the important duties of his position.” He added: “The trust placed in you (President Buhari) by students will undoubtedly be a source of great inspiration to continue the good work started in building up the well-being and unity of our country and its people and maintaining the security of our nation.” He expressed optimism the cordial relationship between Tinubu and Buhari would keep the state as an ally of the federal government. “I am deeply confident that under the leadership of our mentor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Lagos state will remain close allies deeply committed to protecting the interest of your administration and working together for the success of the country at large,” he said. The NANS chairman also congratulated the former Lagos state governor for engineering a second term victory for the incumbent government. He urged students to troop out next weekend to vote Babajide SanwoOlu, the gubernatorial candidate of the APC.
