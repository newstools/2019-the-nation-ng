Justice Laniran Akintola of the Oyo State High Court 9 in Ibadan, the state capital has fixed March 22 for report of settlement in a suit filed by parents of some female Muslim students of University of Ibadan International School Ibadan (ISI) over denial on use of Hijab. Some parents of some Muslim students of ISI had dragged the school management to court for alleged violation of  the fundamental human right of their wards by disallowing the wearing of hijab on their school uniform. The Muslim parents who filed the suit on behalf of their children are: Taofeek Yekinni, Idris Badiru, Sikiru Babarinde, Muideen Akerele, Abdurrahman Balogun and nine others. Also joined as respondents in the suit are the University of Ibadan, Principal of the school, Mrs. Phebean Olowe and the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics) University of Ibadan who doubles as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, Professor Yinka Aderinto. The claimants want the court to declare the continuous denial of the authority of ISI to allow the female Muslim students from wearing hijab on their school uniform as wrongful and unconstitutional.
