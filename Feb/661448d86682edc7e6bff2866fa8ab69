FC Barcelona have agreed to extend left full-back Jordi Albaâ€™s contract until 2024, the La Liga leaders said in a statement on Thursday. The club also said they have included an eye-watering buy-out clause of 500 million euros (428 million pounds). Spain international Alba has played 282 games for Barca since re-joining from Valencia in 2012 after being released by the club as a teenager. He has won 14 trophies, including four La Liga titles, four Copa del Reys and the 2015 UEFA Champions League. The 29-year-old Alba has been capped 67 times by Spain and was part of the side that won the 2012 European Championship. The full-back has grown in importance to the team since Ernesto Valverde took over as coach in 2017 and has a good understanding with Lionel Messi. He has provided 20 assists for the Argentine forward. NAN
