A 31-year-old woman, Shaki Adebayo, who allegedly burnt her 12-year-old son with iron, has been arraigned at a Tinubu Chief Magistrates’ Court. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Hafsat Ajibode said the defendant committed the offence on February 10, at about 3pm, at her home. She alleged that the defendant, a mother of three, assaulted her 12-year-old eldest child, by burning him with iron for not returning from an errand in time. “Adebayo claimed that she sent her son on an errand since about 9am and he returned at about 4pm. “She inflicted injury on the boy with hot pressing iron out of anger for the boy’s irresponsible act. “A neighbour, who was aware of the defendant’s maltreatment towards her three children, forced the door open when she heard the boy’s screams and cries. “When she saw how badly the boy’s body was burnt, she came to the station to report the defendant, which led to her arrest,” Ajibode said. Chief Magistrate Tajudeen Elias granted the accused N50,000 bail with one surety, who must be a relative of the defendant. The case continues on March 13.
