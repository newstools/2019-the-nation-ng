The Photographer attached to Bayelsa State Government House, Reginald Dei, is not dead but in critical condition contrary to earlier reports. Dei was reported dead on Saturday after he was shot at close range in Oweikorogha, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state. Sources said Dei, who was a popular photographer, was shot by troops of the Joint Task Force (JTF), Operation Delta Safe. But JTF immediately refuted the allegations saying its troops were not involved in any skirmishes in the local government area during the election. Investigations, however, revealed that Dei was gasping for breath and battling for survival at an undisclosed hospital in Yenagoa, the state capital. It was learnt that the victim was in life support as doctors were battling to stabilize him. Some government officials led by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, were said to have visited him at the hospital. A member of the team, who spoke in confidence, said Dei was placed on oxygen adding that there was an urgent need to fly him abroad. He said the bullet hit him badly at close range from behind affecting an undisclosed major organ in his body. “He needs to be flown abroad and it must be done urgently. We sympathize with the family of Dei and we will do everything possible to save his life”, he said. Journalists in the state including members of Government House media crew were happy that Dei was still alive as they prayed God to save his life.
