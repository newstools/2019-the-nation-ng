Nollywood actor Seun Kentebe has said Nigerians are not ready to move forward. He stated this via his Facebook account in the light of how the presidential and national assembly elections which held on Saturday across the country went. “If you were expecting a free and fair election, “Sorely disappointed” doesn’t even begin to describe your emotional state of mind right now,” he wrote. “Then again, you should’ve seen it coming. This is Nigeria after all. My heart goes out to those who lost their lives, may the people they left behind find the strength to bear the losses. Nigerians aren’t ready to move forward.” Born William Oluwaseun Amatare Adebayo Omobolanle Edwin-Kentebe, but popularly known as Seun Kentebe, the actor is one of Nigeria’s promising stage and screen actors. The Bayelsa State-born actor was raised in Lagos and has featured in about 28 films, nine television series, 43 plays, 15 radio jobs and two television commercials. He was also one of the stars in the epic film on Ebola, 93 Days, starring alongside Bimbo Akintola, Danny Glover, among others.
