 Fulham’s player Benjamin Davis faces jail in Singapore after the Fulham youngster defaulted on National Service. All men in Singapore over the age of 18 must complete two years of National Service unless they are handed an exemption, or risk three years in jail. Davis, who became the first Singaporean to sign a professional deal at a Premier League club when he penned a two-year contract at Fulham in July, was not granted permission to miss National Service. Singapore’s Ministry of Defence declared: ‘Mr Benjamin Davis is a national service defaulter. ‘He failed to report for national service as required. He is also staying overseas without a valid Exit Permit.’ Exemptions are usually only handed to Olympians, with regular sportsmen not considered for them. A Football Association of Singapore spokesperson said: ‘The FAS is extremely disappointed with Mr Benjamin Davis’ default of his NS obligations. It is thoroughly irresponsible on the part of Mr Davis, and also reneges on his (and his father’s) assurance to the FAS that Mr Davis would discharge his NS commitments and play for the Singapore national team. ‘Mr Davis had lived in Singapore for many years, and has benefited from the resources used to educate and train him as a footballer over this period of time. He was invited to play for the Singapore national team, and he agreed. ‘The FAS had supported Benjamin Davis’ application to defer NS on this basis. ‘While the matter will now be dealt with by Mindef, the FAS wishes to state categorically that we do not condone such conduct nor did it ever arise in our discussions with Mr Davis that he would seek to avoid his liability.’
