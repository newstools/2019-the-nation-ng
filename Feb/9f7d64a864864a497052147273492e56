International observers in last Saturday’s elections have recounted how they were assaulted by thugs working for some top politicians in Akwa Ibom State. The observer groups – Pan African Women Projects and Intercontinental Leadership Initiative – at a news conference yesterday, berated the credibility of the elections in the state. The Publicity Secretary of Pan African Women Projects, Ms Mphoentie Keitseng, said they were assaulted by thugs in Essien Udim council where the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Akwa Ibom Northwest, Senator Godswill Akpabio, hails from. Her words: “The collection of materials at many collation centres was characterised by thuggery and intimidation of the electoral officer and INEC ad hoc workers. At Essien Udim Collation Centre, Foreign/Domestic Observers and reporters were attacked by the thugs of Akpabio while trying to enter the collation centre. This incident was recorded. Godswill Akpabio and his thugs took their bestiality to another level when they ambushed and attacked foreign observers who visited Essien Udim…” Efforts to reach Akpabio’s media aide, Anietie Ekong, were unsuccessful.
