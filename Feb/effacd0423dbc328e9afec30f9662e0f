The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has queried the sources of inflows into the accounts of the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen. It also said its investigation of the CJN indicated that the inflows “are not typical of the financial transactions of a public servant.” The anti-graft agency asked the National Judicial Council (NJC) to consider its petition against Justice Onnoghen and asked him to defend himself. Although the EFCC is still conducting more investigation on Justice Onnoghen, it forwarded a preliminary report to the NJC for consideration. It was gathered that the decision of the NJC will guide the next action on the suspended CJN. It was learnt that once the suspension of the CJN is ratified by the NJC or if Justice Onnoghen is asked to proceed on retirement, the EFCC will be at an advantage to grill him. But in its petition, the EFCC  said its investigation confirmed suspicious payments into the CJN’s accounts. Such funds  include  $30,000 allegedly paid by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Joe Agi, who was quizzed last week. It said the sources of inflows into some of the CJN’s accounts were questionable. “From the investigation conducted so far, it is possible that the payments into the various accounts might be bribes. This is because the sources of the inflows into his accounts other than the salary account in Union Bank of Nigeria Plc are unknown and probably fraudulent, and the nature of the transactions (including structured payments) is not typical of the financial transactions of a public servant. The preliminary investigation report on Justice Onnoghen reads: “An Intelligence Report that the above mentioned subject was alleged to be involved in a number of bribery and corrupt activities. “Upon receipt of the Report, a preliminary investigation was conducted during which the following actions were carried out. In the report to the NJC, the EFCC gave the details of how cash was remitted into the dollar, pound sterling, Euro and Naira accounts The summary of the EFCC’s findings is as follows: Standard Chartered Bank USD ($) Account: “The following highlights some of the suspicious activities in the account.
