Despite has come the way of two ex-Insurance officials Mr George Omokaro and Pa Pulley Osayande, who have been down with varied life-threatening health challenges as Edo deputy governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu has promised to offset their medical bills with additional cash for upkeeps. Comrade Shuaibu made the promise when he paid a solidarity visit to the two ex-Insurers in Benin last night. Shuaibu, in separate meetings with the ex-Insurers, told them that the Obaseki government does not turn its back on those who had served the state meritoriously and assured them of support. “The information on your health condition came to my attention yesterday and I feel you people deserve our support. And I want you to know that you are not abandoned. We are taking care of your medical bills and will also follow up with the process until you are okay.” He assured. The deputy Governor specifically directed that Mr Pulley be taken to UBTH for further treatment by medical experts as he was not pleased with the condition he met him after the surgical operation done on him in a private hospital in Benin. Mr George Omokaro is one of the greatest players that ever played for Insurance. He was captain of the team in his time and father of Charles Omokaro the current captain of Insurance. George Omokaro also at a time, served as FA chairman in Edo state and was NFF board member, while Pulley Osayande served as a driver popularly referred to as ‘Pilot one’.
