The group comprising the hearing-impaired, visually-impaired, cripple, dumb, down syndrome and others with various deformities, well-wishers, party faithful and supporters trooped out to participate in the walk. They gathered at the APC secretariat on Borno Way, by Coates junction in Ebute-Meta, from where they moved with drum sets, singing and dancing through Herbert Macaulay Way, Adekunle, Alagomeji en route to Sabo. The Chairman, Elders’ Forum of the People Living with Disabilities, Mr. Adisa Adeniyi, said it was important for people living with disabilities to appreciate members of APC, especially Senator Oluremi Tinubu and others for assisting them, adding: “This is payback time for us to express our gratitude to them.” The Coordinator, Movement for Disable Right Forum, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, hailed his members for trooping out for the rally.
