A 25-year-old man, Adebayo Jubril, was yesterday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing imported plastic rubbers valued at N1.5million. Prosecuting Inspector Aondohemba Koti said the defendant committed the offence on January 14 at Mushin, Lagos. He said the kegs of 25 litres each belonged to Mr. Abdullahi Mohammed. Koti said the complainant observed that his kegs were always missing and he could not trace them to anybody, until luck ran against the defendant. “The defendant always scaled the fence to gain access into the company’s premises at night to steal the kegs. ”He was caught when he was selling them on Lagos Island,” the prosecutor said. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Magistrate M.O. Tanimola granted him N200, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government (LASG). The case continues on February 13.
