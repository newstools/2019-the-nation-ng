The Southwest Coordinator of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council, Chief Olusola Oke, yesterday urged residents of Ondo and Ekiti states to come out massively to receive President Muhammadu Buhari and other APC leaders today. Oke said there would be no APC without the contributions of the Southwest. Addressing reporters in Akure, the Ondo State capital, to herald the President’s visit, the campaign coordinator said the region in the past three and a half years gained more than it did in the 16 years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said: “The Southwest is the engine room of this government and APC as a party. President Buhari has done more for us than the 16 years of the PDP. We have been a major beneficiary of the change mantra and ready for the Next Level. “Rehabilitation and expansion of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, construction of 158-kilometre Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail, dualisation of Oyo-Ogbomosho road, Lagos-Ore-Benin road and other major infrastructure are being centred in this region by President Buhari. “Major ministries are being managed by our people from the Southwest. You don’t change a winning formula. We want to retain a working formula.” Oke said the recent endorsement by some groups, like Ohaneze N’digbo, Afenifere, among others, would not affect the chances of President Buhari in the February 16 election. He said: “Afenifere and other groups are not political parties that can muster votes in the coming elections.”
