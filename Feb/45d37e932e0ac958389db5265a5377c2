The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) in November 2018 recorded a trading surplus of ₦2.06billion, which represented a laudable improvement of 116% over the previous month’s deficit of ₦12.66billion. This increase in performance month-on-month was primarily attributable to improved efficiency of the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company’s (NPDC) operations.

The release said this translated to a total supply of 1,204.76 mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 2,905.06 mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month, implying that 57.91% of the average daily gas produced was commercialized while the balance of 42.09% was re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared.
