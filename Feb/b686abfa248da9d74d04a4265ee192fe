The new 40-bed hospital of the Federal College of Education (Technical) Omoku, Rivers State, has been gutted by fire. Though no life was lost, property worth millions of naira was destroyed by the inferno before the incident was noticed by a passerby. The hospital is located at the permanent site (Campus II) of the college. The cause of the fire was not ascertained as at the time of filing this report. It took the intervention of the Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited, OB/OB fire fighters and other sympathisers hours to put out the fire. However,  the building has been badly destroyed by the inferno. It was gathered that the fire, which occurred after workers had left for Presidential and National Assembly elections earlier scheduled for February 16, 2019, was said to have started from the hospital’s right-wing before it spread to other parts. The college provost, Dr Emmanuel Ikenyiri, who was at the scene of the fire, was visibly angry and shocked. He described the incident as sad, unfortunate and a monumental loss to the institution. He, however, thanked Almighty God that no life was lost. The Provost commended the Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited fire service for their swift intervention. According to him, if not for their gallant efforts, the fire would have touched other buildings. He, therefore, appealed to the Federal and Rivers State Governments, TETFUND, the NNPC, SPDC, NAOC Ltd, NDDC, Total Petroleum and other corporate organisations and individuals to come to the aid of the institution by rebuilding the destroyed hospital. The Provost and Management thanked all those who sympathised with the institution for the fire outbreak.
