A 19-year-old commercial model, Zainab Odugbemi, has emerged as the Model of the week for Svelte Magazine. Odugbemi, an undergraduate of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic in Abeokuta, Ogun State, emerged the winner as she revealed the state of Nigeria with her recent photo shoot. Odugbemi, who is also a writer started modelling in 2017. “The truth is a delicate egg and maybe breaking it and making do with the yolk might just be a lasting solution to our innate chaos — the trickles of raindrops from our actions that have in turn flooded our huts and hiding places,” said Odugbemi about her shoot. “There’s no war or crisis in the world without religion as a major tool to its promotion, perhaps it’s high time we understood that religion, spirituality and faith are things of the mind. It’s not enough to sprawl on religious grounds day and night when hypocrisy is a founding father and the same men who made the rules today break it first. “But what more can we say of old men who should be in their huts but rather stretch out to drag political offices with their grandchildren? This chain of political recycling, lorded godfatherism and extreme fanaticism must end. God is a busy man, why do humans complicate it all even when they had it all?”
