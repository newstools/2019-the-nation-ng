He said: “I am back into the fold of the APC.  Senator Wamakko is my able and dependable father. He is a just, honest and a transparent leader. “This day is very historic for me, my family and all my political associates. I have admitted making mistakes but I should be forgiven. “I hereby promise to work assiduously to ensure the success of the candidates of the party at all levels during the forthcoming general polls.” Wamakko, who represents Sokoto North Senatorial District, welcomed back the commissioner, describing him as a true and loyal son.
