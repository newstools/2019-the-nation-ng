The Niger state chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress ( NLC ) has described the Federal government school feeding programme as a corrupt and wasteful venture calling for its stop. The Niger state Chairman of NLC, Comrade Yahaya Ndako Idris made the call while speaking at “a solemn Assembly” organised by the Niger state wing of the Nigeria Union of Teachers on Monday. He said that the money spent on the school feeding programme can be used for other educational programmes that would be beneficial to the school children. He said that N9 million claimed to have been spent monthly by the federal government could have been used for renovation of many schools that are already in dilapidated states. ” The federal government should immediately stop the school feeding programme, it is total corruption, they should use the money for other programmes, they commit the money to the renovation of schools. ” We agree today that the federal government should stop school feeding everybody feeds his child before taking them to school.” Commending the NUT for organising the “solemn assembly”, Idris said it is important for everything to be put in the hands of God as God is the only one who can settle the challenges bedevilling the nation. The State Chairman of the NUT, Comrade Ibrahim Umar appreciated teachers in the state for being dedicated to their job even in the face of daunting challenges calling on the government to improve the condition of service of teachers. During the solemn assembly, prayers were offered for the smooth conduct of the general elections and for God to ” touch the hearts of the leadership” to do the bidding of workers especially teachers. The major prayer point at the solemn Assembly was that God should allow the national assembly to pass the N30,000 minimum wage bill before it.
