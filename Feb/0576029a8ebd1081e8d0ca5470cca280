As actors and former couple Saidi Balogun and Fathia Williams celebrated their birthday yesterday, it remained a surprise that as at 5pm, they had not wished each other birthday greetings. Though they are said to have remain friends, having gone their separate ways, years back, a lot of their fans will love to have them both back as couple. While both have been posting pictures to celebrate the day, the two are yet to send each other a birthday message on social media. Actor/producer Saidi Balogun wrote on his timeline: “It is yet another February 5th and I cannot but be grateful to the Almighty God for allowing me to see yet another birthday of mine! There is no doubt that God has been wonderful to me over the years and especially in the last 365 days! I give Him all the glory for all He has done and will continue to do in my life! Thank you Baba God.” While his ex-wife wrote: “Birthday is a reminder of how far God has taken us and the beautiful future he has ahead of us. I am super grateful for another opportunity to start again.” It will be recalled, Saidi Balogun was spotted with ex-wife Fathia Balogun spraying her money while on the dance floor, at Mercy Aigbe 40th Birthday Party, held last which saw her colleagues Dayo Amusa, among others hailing the actor.
