Embattled R&B singer, R. Kelly, on Monday, pleaded not guilty to all 10 charges that he sexually abused four people, including three minors. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, in a plea entered by his attorney, Steve Greenberg, at the arraignment hearing before Cook County Associate Judge Lawrence Flood at Leighton Criminal Court, where he appeared in an orange jumpsuit. Hours after his arraignment, Kelly, 52, put up the $100,000 bond needed for his release and was spotted leaving Cook County Jail at around 5:30 p.m. local time. Many wonder how the singer was able to raise the money, as his finances are currently a “mess”, according to Greenberg. The Grammy-winning singer was arrested and charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse on Friday and spent the weekend behind bars after his bail bond was set for $1 million for which he could put up 10 percent of the total bond required in order to walk free. Meanwhile, Michael Avenatti, who is representing two of Kelly’s alleged victims on Monday said he has turned over to prosecutors a second videotape that he claims shows a 14-year-old girl engaged in a sex act with the singer. That video is about 55 minutes long and from 1999 or 2000, Avenatti said. Kelly’s next court date has been scheduled for March 22. 2019.
