Going by the results so far released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), 73 registered political parties fielded candidates in Saturday’s Presidential Election for the fun of it. Only President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his challenger Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were showing strength as the results of the poll trickled in yesterday. The Returning Officers from the states were at the International Conference Centre (ICC) venue of the National Collation Centre of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja to announce the results. Some of the early results announced by the electoral umpire were those of Ekiti, Osun, Ondo, Kwara, Nasarawa, Abia and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). But the results from other states had been announced at the state level by the presidential collation officers appointed by the INEC. They include: Oyo, Niger, Kano, Kogi, Adamawa and Kaduna, among others. Prof. Idowu Olayinka, Vice Chancellor, University of Ibadan (UI), who is the Collation Officer for the election in the Ekiti, announced President Buhari of the APC as winner.

He said that of the 899,919 registered voters in the state, 395,741 were accredited; 393,709 votes were cast and 12, 577 were rejected.

The APC agent declined to sign the result sheet, which his PDP counterpart signed. The presidential collation officer in the FCT said the agent’s refusal was based on his claim that some of his party’s supporters were disenfranchised and not based on manipulation of the votes.
