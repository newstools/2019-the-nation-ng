Women leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State Jumoke Okoya-Thomas has urged women to mobilise their neighbours, friends and relatives to vote for the APC. Okoya-Thomas, who spoke at the APC Women Rally at Lagos Campos Square Stadium, said women were ready for the elections. She said: “Women in Lagos State are ready to back all our candidates, including President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, governorship candidate Babajide Olusola Sanwoolu, his deputy Obafemi Hamzat, and other candidates. “I want you to support all of the candidates of the APC; ensure you collect your PVCs and vote. We want all the women to go to the streets and move around to campaign for the elections, and ensure that their votes count.” The women leader praised the women for their roles in the campaign so far, saying women have always played positive roles in the past elections. She reiterated that the government of Mr. Sanwoolu and Dr. Hamzat would carry women along if they become governor and deputy governor.
