The organizers of the maiden edition of the Lagos Media Marathon said on Monday that the event would now hold on May 1. The Chairman, Organizing Committee, Tony Ubani, said in Lagos that the new date was arrived at after extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders. According to him, the marathon was initially billed for Dec. 1, 2018, but was moved forward due to some logistic reasons that have been sorted out by the organisers. “Yes, we have a new date for our race now; the First Lagos Media Marathon will now take place on May 1, and we are working very hard to make it a memorable one. “We will further push for more innovations which are now being worked upon to add more sparks to the media race. “For us, we don’t believe in just rushing to do any event. “We want to get it right from this first race that is why we have chosen this new date which is May 1. “As already announced, the maiden Lagos Media Marathon will have two categories of 5 Kilometres and 10 Kilometres races which is opened to all journalists and others in the media industry. “Aside from journalists and students who are going to be allowed to participate in the media marathon for free, other members of the public interested in taking part will be registered with a token,” he said. Expressing delight at the new date, Debo Oshundun, the Chairman, Sports Writers Association of Nigerian (SWAN), Lagos State chapter, enjoined all journalists to do all within their reach to support this innovation. “This is our project and we must make the best out of it. “We are very concerned with the healthy living of our members and this one is a major way to improve on that,’’ he said.
