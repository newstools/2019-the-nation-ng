A 13-year-old girl, who was impregnated by her father, has been delivered of a baby at the Benin Central Hospital, Benin City, Edo State. The teenager, who was in primary six when her father impregnated her, has been in protective custody of the Edo State Government. She is the eldest daughter of her 42-year-old father identified as Friday Moses. Her father, a commercial motorcyclist, started having sex with her since she was seven after the death of her mother. An Edo State Family Court in October last year sentenced the man to 14 years imprisonment with hard labour without an option of fine. The father hails from Cross River State, but lives in Edo State. The Nation learnt that the teenager was delivered of a baby last Saturday. She told reporters that she would like to continue her education and become a doctor. The teenager said at the time she was impregnated by her father, she was yet to write her First School Leaving Certificate examination. She said she would be happy if her education was supported by good spirited individuals. The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Philip Ugbodaga, said he had directed the management to cancel the bills of the teenager. He said the hospital was collaborating with the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development to take proper care of the teenaged mother and her baby. Women Affairs and Social Development Commissioner Ms Magdalene Ohenhen could not be reached for comments.
