The governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Oyo State, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, has said he will not join other opposition candidates to form an alliance against the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Adebayo Adelabu. Alao-Akala, who is a former governor, said he was not working for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate or any other for an alliance, as reported in some sections of the media. Speaking through his campaign organisation yesterday, the ADP candidate said the reports were aimed at “misinforming and confusing our teeming supporters the world over”. The statement by the Director General of the campaign organisation, Chief Wale Ohu, reads: “At a time, the rumour in town was that he was not serious about his governorship ambition and that he was going to play the role of a spoiler or work for another governorship candidate. “The most recent is that he is working for the PDP governorship candidate, Seyi Makinde. “The Akala Campaign Organisation hereby debunks all these insinuations. They are the handiwork of the propaganda machinery of the government in power in Oyo State, which is jittery and overwhelmed by the soaring popularity of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala and to state clearly that the former governor is committed to taking the people of Oyo State out of the political mess they have been plunged by the insensitive APC government of Senator Abiola Ajimobi since he left office eight years ago. “Otunba Alao-Akala has toured the nooks and crannies of Oyo State, taking the message of hope to the citizenry, which was received with enthusiasm by the people. “Alao-Akala is not into any discussion, alliance or talks with the PDP governorship candidate Makinde or any other for that matter.
