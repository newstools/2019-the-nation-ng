Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC), is unhappy with the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) for not submitting its annual report and observing other FRC requirements. A statement from the FRC signed by Bede Ogueri Anyanwu, Acting Head, Strategic Communication Directorate, said the “Acting Chairman of Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC),  Victor Muruako frowned at the fact that FHA has not been submitting their annual audited account, receipts of their remittances, budgets, Medium Term Expenditure Framework, (MTEF) and operational strategic plan, thereby hampering prompt and accurate determination of operating surplus liabilities.” The Acting Chairman spoke at the Stakeholders meeting with the management of the FHA at the Commission’s Headquarters, in Asokoro, Abuja. Muruako pointed out that the independent revenue drive of the Federal Government is not encouraging and Federal Housing Authority has not been complying fully with the provisions of section 21, 22 and 23 of Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007. Muruako implored them to update their Chief Executive about the Commission’s readiness to offer them training on the recently launched template on the calculation of Operating Surplus to improve compliance. In his remarks, the Head of Monitoring and Evaluation of FRC, Alhaji Ola Tijani pointed out that Federal Housing Authority should not pretend about compliance, but must show proof of prudence, accountability and transparency in financial reporting in order to be in line with the FRA 2007.
