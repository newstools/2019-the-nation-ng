No fewer than three persons were feared dead at a polling unit in Amukpe area of Sapele, Delta State during yesterday’s elections. Two others were badly injured. Eye witnesses described the assailants as political thugs. They said the suspected thugs unexpected swooped on the voters who were queuing to vote and opened fire. Two died on the spot while three others who were hit were rushed to the hospital. One of them however died. A resident said: “I’m not sure if they carted election materials away, but I saw that the ground of the place was littered with election materials, giving me the impression that they only scattered the materials.” The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Adeleke Adeyinka, could not confirm the incident, saying he wanted to get across to the people on the ground in Amukpe to ascertain the truth. But a reliable security source said: “immediately we heard of the situation, we moved in to take over the area so as to stabilize it and prevent a further escalation of the situation.” Meanwhile, voting was relatively peaceful in most other polling units as voters were seen casting their votes. For instance, Sapele ward 7, units 7 and 8, along Ugberikoko Road, voters were still casting their votes at 2:09pm.
