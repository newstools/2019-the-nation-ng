Leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has called off the proposed boycott of elections by his ground in the entire South-East region. Kanu said the decision was reached following wide consultations with “stakeholders.” Kanu had severally warned that elections would only hold in any part of the zone on the condition of a referendum to determine the sovereignty of Biafra. But in a statement on Friday by the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB said the boycott order was lifted after all terms and conditions were met by “those wishing us to lift the ban on voting.” The statement partly reads: “It’s important we notify the world at large and the indefatigable global IPOB family in particular that our supreme leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has called-off the election boycott in Biafraland. “After a brief emergency session of the Directorate of State late last night presided over by our leader, it was determined that all our terms and conditions had been met by those wishing us to lift the ban on voting, it was unanimously agreed that the boycott should be lifted. “The signed document agreeing to IPOB terms and conditions are in our possession and will be made public in due course. “We can, therefore, state with utmost sense of responsibility and pride that IPOB has accomplished what no other people or group has been able to do in the history of our people. “Without prejudice, this will go down as the defining moment when the irreversibility of the restoration of Biafra was firmly entrenched in the subconscious of all and sundry. “As a result of which we can state categorically that Biafra is a lot closer than we think as a result of this.“
