A 31-year-old man, Oladele Omotosho, who allegedly defrauded a woman of N2 million under the guise of giving her spiritual cleansing, has appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, who lives at Inland Street, by Oladele bus stop, Ibadan, Oyo State, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretences and stealing before Magistrate M.I. Dan-Oni. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Victor Eruada said the defendant committed the offence in connivance with others at large on June 17, 2016, in Lagos. He alleged that the defendant defrauded Mrs. Mojisola Sufian, to whom he presented himself as a spiritualist with special abilities to solve spiritual problems. Eruada said the defendant told Sufian that she would conceive a child if he conducted spiritual cleansing for her, adding that the defendant told the woman to bring N2 million for the exercise. “Omotosho saw a vision for the complainant (Sufian) that she would conceive after spiritual cleansing, which he never did. “When the complainant demanded her money, the defendant told her that he did not have the money. “The case was reported, and the defendant arrested,” the prosecutor said. The magistrate granted the defendant N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned till March 6.
