Flying Eagles have qualified for this year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup after they beat hosts Niger 1-0 to qualify for the semifinal of the U-20 AFCON in Niamey yesterday. Kano Pillars’ midfielder Alhassan Adamu’s free kick from an acute angle in the 73rd minute proved to be the match winner for the Nigeria U-20 side. Nigeria should have opened scoring as early as the fourth minute when striker Nazifi Yahaya was put through on goal, but his shot was somehow kept out. Early in the second half, Niger goalkeeper did well to push out for a corner a goal-bound header. Niger battled hard, but they lacked quality when they pushed forward. They came close towards the end of the game, but it was too little too late for the tournament hosts. South Africa beat Burundi in the other Group A match in Maradi to qualify on five points and battle Group B winners Senegal for a place in the final.
