Sacks Abiodun’s Supporters from Stadium Scores of hoodlums chanting the slogan of a rival opposition governorship candidate on Monday disrupted the Presidential rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and sacked supporters of the Prince Dapo Abiodun, the governorship candidate of APC, from the main bowl of the MKO stadium, Abeokuta Other APC members and supporters seated awaiting the arrival of President Muhammadu Buhari for planned rally, were also chased away as the thugs hurled stones, shoes and other dangerous weapons at them. Many were injured in the attacks, forcing thousands of people to leave the stadium while the President is yet to arrive. In less than 10 minutes, all the seats and positions occupied by Dapo Abiodun supporters and other APC members were deserted as stones and objects hurled by the hoodlums, fell on them in torrents. Some of the hoodlums were overheard brazenly boasting “this is Ogun and nobody can intimidate us” while throwing stones at the fleeing APC members and supporters of Abiodun. Not even the announcement of the arrival of the wife of the Vice – President, Dolapo Osinbajo, at the time could elicit respite to the reign of terror unleashed on people. Outside the stadium, dozens of armed soldiers and other security agencies battled to prevent the entry of another batch of hoodlums who were allegedly hurried to the venue to reinforce their colleagues who had seized the main bowl of the main stadium. Many were appalled that a Fuji musician called to entertain at the occasion, prodded the hoodlums on with inciting lyrics even as those who ought to ensure orderliness at the venue acted as though they were on holiday. There was palpable concern over the safety of the APC chieftains such as Senator Gbenga Kaka, Abiodun’s running mate, Noimot Oyedele – Salako, Chief Tolu Odebiyi and others, with many wondering if they were able to leave the stadium unscathed.
