Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chairman Alhaja Funmilayo Akande-Muhammed yesterday distributed free Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) forms to 100 pupils. She said the gesture was to improve literacy and relieve parents from financial burden. “This is a golden opportunity aimed at giving you the opportunity to excel in life. Education is one of the key programmes of any good administration and by this gesture we are empowering you for future. Your destiny is in your hands. “Every candidate knows that to qualify for admission into any higher institution, you must score high marks in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). JAMB is the stepping stone and it is my prayer that you will all pass your exams in flying colours and pursue your dream in life. This will give us the zeal to do more and also help in moulding future leaders,” Akande-Muhammed added. She warned youths to shun violence and concentrate on their studies. “Let me take this opportunity to remind the youth that election is around the corner. Please stay away from violence, fighting, hooliganism and all kinds of nefarious activities and crimes. “Don’t allow yourselves to be used as thugs. If you look around, you will see security operatives at all strategic junctions. Anyone caught will be prosecuted. “We are available for any hint or information that will promote peace and security,” the council boss said.
