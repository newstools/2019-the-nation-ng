A 22-year-old man, Ifeanyi Daniel, is to spend one year in jail with hard labour for stealing a wheelbarrow worth N25, 000. Daniel was sentenced by an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrate, Mrs. A.O. Ajibade, who did not give him an option of fine. “The defendant acted badly by depriving the complainant of a means to feed his family; this will serve as a lesson to others out there,’’ she said. Daniel had pleaded guilty to stealing the wheelbarrow. The Prosecutor, Insp. Maria Dauda, had told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Sept. 12, 2018, at Oyingbo Bus stop, Ebute Meta, Lagos. Dauda told the court that the defendant stole the wheelbarrow which was handed over to him by the complainant, Mr. Victor Pevin. “Pevin had given Daniel the wheelbarrow to use for ease in carriage of goods and to deliver the sum of N12, 000 weekly to him. “Instead, Daniel decided to take the N25, 000 wheelbarrow to Mile 12 to sell for N7,000,’’ she said. NAN reports that the offence contravened Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
