After playing second fiddle to Ghana’s Vincent Torgah at the 2019 Eko Challenge Cup, Sunday Olapade is not fazed by the outcome of the tournament as he is aiming for six titles this season. To emerge champion, Torgah beat Olapade by eleven strokes with -18 under par after 72 holes of play. To finish second, Olapade had a flawless -3 under (69) in his third round to extend his lead over another Ghanaian Emos Koblarh at -7 under par before dropping a shot in his final round after failing to hold off the pressure mounted by Torgah during the final round where he carded a (73) +1 over par. However, a determined Olapade told NationSport yesterday that being the first tournament of the new season; he is not deterred by the outcome of the Eko Challenge Cup. “I feel so cool finishing second place at the Eko Challenge Cup because the season just started and the show has just began, I played well so I am comfortable with the outcome. I must also admit that Torgah played very well as he was at the top of his game for the week because he played consecutively under par throughout the week. He also swung very well and he deserved the victory. I tried my best to catch up with him but as God would have it, what is meant to be will be,” he said. He added: “We have 16 tournaments for the season and Torgah just won one out of it, so I’m looking forward to win at least six titles for the season and it is going to happen as I believe strongly in myself. Torgah is a very cool and calm golfer, very cool to play with and we have a lot of strong players in the tour. Now I think it is not going to be easy for everyone of us to win just like that but I need to work very hard and make it happen, Togarh is not a threat at all.
