The Adamawa State chapter of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has distanced itself from the party’s National Executive Council (NEC) endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for next week’s presidential election. The chairman of the SDP in Adamawa State, Mr. John Muva, said during a press briefing at the state secretariat of the party in Yola Friday that members of the party in the state will have nothing to do with Buhari come February 16. The NEC of the SDP in Abuja had endorsed Buhari on Thursday, attributing its decision to the “lingering legal battle” between the winner of the SDP presidential primaries, Donald Duke, and his major challenger, Jerry Gana, but the Adamawa SDP chairman insisted Friday that the stalemate over the party’s presidential candidacy is not a sufficient reason to mix the loyalty of members among different political parties and candidates when elections come. “We are not part of that endorsement and we were not a part of the meeting held in Abuja to decide that endorsement. We respect the rule of law and the constitution of the Social Democratic Party, but the differences between Donald Duke and Jerry Gana cannot put our state chapter in jeopardy. We are not part of that endorsement,” John Muva insisted. He said that in Adamawa State SDP members are not thinking of supporting Buhari or Atiku (of the People’s Democratic Party) for the presidency but of supporting the state SDP governorship candidate, Emmanuel Bello, and other party candidates at the other levels. “We won’t mix things up in Adamawa State. We can’t do SDP for National Assembly election, Buhari’s party in presidential election, and SDP in other elections. It is SDP top to bottom,” Muva asserted.
