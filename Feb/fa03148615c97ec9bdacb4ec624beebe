A 20-year-old man, Emen George, was yesterday sentenced to one-month imprisonment by an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court, for playing Betnaija game of N50, 000 on credit. Magistrate E. Kubeinje convicted George for causing breach of the peace. She held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. “The accused is hereby sentenced to one month imprisonment or a fine of N10, 000,” Kubeinje said. Prosecuting Inspector Lucky Ihiehie alleged that the defendant committed the offence on January 28 by playing a game of N50, 000 at a Betnaija centre at Barbinton Street, Mile 12, Ketu, Lagos, without paying. He said the accused had no money on him when he was searched.
