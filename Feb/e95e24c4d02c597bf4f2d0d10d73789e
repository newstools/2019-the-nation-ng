Africans in America, a non-governmental organization committed in addressing issues affecting new African immigrants has expressed disappointment over the postponement of Saturday’s election. Executive Director of the organization, Bonaventure Ezekwenna, who stated this in Awka, alleged that the postponement of the exercise was an attempt to frustrate international observers. He said, “It cost me a lot of money to come down to Nigeria to register and to come here again this time to vote. “Flight tickets from New York to Nigeria, hotel accommodation, feeding, communications, logistics and miscellaneous, it’s a lot of money, it’s a lot of sacrifice.” According to him, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has through its actions exposed itself as incompetent, incredible and unreliable agency. “This action is a loud statement that the agency is incapable of conducting credible election in Nigeria,” he said. Ezekwenna called for the resignation of the leadership of the electoral umpire over its incompetency. He said, “The chairman and leadership of INEC need to do the only right thing at this moment which is to resign because despite all the money given to them and all the ample time they have to prepare for this election, they have shown their incompetency. “Former INEC Chairman, Professor Jega is more credible, and should probably come back to clean up this mess.”
