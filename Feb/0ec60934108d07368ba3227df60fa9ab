The Chief Medical Director (CMD) University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Prof. Temitope Alonge, has revealed that cancer is the commonest cause of death in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital since 2015. Alonge disclosed this while reflecting on his eight-year tenure in an interaction with reporters in Ibadan. The Orthopedic surgeon explained that data generated from the hospital revealed that cancer has been the leading source of death in the hospital along with infections including HIV/AIDS, injuries and Cardiovascular diseases since 2015. To address the ugly trend, Alonge said the hospital acquired two 22-channel brachi-therapy machines able to treat the three commonest types of cancer. He added the machine can treat minimum of 50 patients a day. According to him, most of the infections are HIV/AIDS-related, dismissing the impression the killer virus has been largely stamped out as a ruse. He said the campaign against stigmatisation may have contributed to the spread of the virus again, as infected people live without stigma, get more comfortable but go round to infect unsuspecting members of the public. Alonge said he was leaving the position fulfilled because he succeeded largely in his dream of transforming the UCH. He added his goal was to build the people, build a system and build service and infrastructures that will enable the hospital regain its status as the leading teaching hospital in West Africa. He pointed out that he succeeded in the goal, hence his feeling of fulfillment. The outgoing CMD said he enjoyed the support of the staff and Board of Management in his efforts to transform the hospital, stressing that he was leaving the hospital better than he met it. His successor, Prof. Abiodun Otegbayo, takes over at the end of the month.
