Former Senate President David Mark on Monday lamented the demise of Senator Joseph Kennedy Waku. Waku represented Benue North West in the Senate on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) between 1999 and 2003. Reacting to the demise of Senator Waku in Abuja today, Senator Mark recalled the contributions of Waku to socio-economic and political development of Benue State saying “Waku was a foremost stakeholder in Benue Politics”. Mark, in a statement by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, noted that Waku was “a patriotic Nigeria who called a spade its rightful name no matter whose ox was gored. “He stood for the truth at all times. He never pretended. He was brutally frank”. He recalled the exploits of Waku in the Senate during his stint in the Upper Legislative chamber saying that the late lawmaker never compromised on welfare and well- being of the oppressed. The former Senate President noted that Waku was a fearless parliamentarian who was a voice for the voiceless in the society. According to Mark: “His death at this time is devastating.  His wealth of experience would have been handy in resolving the many knotty political problems confronting the nation at the moment. “I have lost a dependable brother and friend. Benue state and indeed Nigeria have lost an unrepentant patriot and democrat.  We shall miss Waku for his steadfastness, humour and pragmatism”.
