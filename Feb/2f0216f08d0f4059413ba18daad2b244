The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of hoarding the presidential and senatorial elections result sheets for undisclosed reasons. The party also claimed that its agents were being denied the INEC accreditation and identification cards, ostensibly to shut them out of the election monitoring process and allow the All Progressives Congress (APC) a field day to manipulate the process. In a statement on Friday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said its monitoring and intelligence showed that INEC has been distributing sensitive election materials in most states of the federation without the presidential and senatorial elections results sheets. The statement said, “The development is already heightening tension and suspicion of underhand method by the commission to open the elections for manipulations and allow the APC to enter fictitious results for onward transmission to collation centers. “Intelligence available to us indicate that this is part of the plot for which President Muhammadu Buhari’s relation by marriage, Mrs. Amina Zakari, has been retained as the head of the INEC collation center. “The PDP therefore cautions INEC to show its impartiality by immediately releasing the Presidential and senatorial elections result sheet as well as the accreditation cards. Any further delay will be a clear recipe for crisis as Nigerians are already highly agitated over the matter. “INEC should note that Nigerians are very anxious about this election and any action that, in anyway, portrays or tends to portray the process as being manipulated is capable of triggering a crisis of unprecedented proportion in our country”.
