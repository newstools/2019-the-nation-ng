Two men were yesterday arraigned at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly beating up two Ikeja Electric (IE) Plc officials for disconnecting their light. Godwin Owen, 42, and Valentine Brown, 38, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye alleged that the defendants committed the offence on February 19, at 11:30pm, at 7, Bamidele Daramola Street, Maryland, Lagos. She said the IE officials, Abdulateef Lukman and Olasunkanmi Adetayo, had gone to the defendants’ flat to disconnect their electricity from the pole because they had not paid bills. Olaluwoye said the defendants, who were flatmates, were owing almost N100,000 electricity bill. She said the defendants pushed Abdulateef off a ladder, and he suffered injuries in his legs. The prosecutor said the defendants also threatened to stab the officials with a kitchen knife. “My Lord, they beat up the IE officials to the point that they had to be taken to hospital,” she added. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendants N200,000 bail with two sureties each in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 15.
