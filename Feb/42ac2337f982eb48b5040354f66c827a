Two bus conductors, Ojo Mudasiru and Ibrahim Yusuf, were yesterday arraigned at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court for alleged possession of a missing person’s phone. Mudasiru, 27, and Yusuf, 28, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Sergeant Modupe Olaluwoye said the defendants committed the offence on February 3, at 3am, on Morocco Road, Shomolu, Lagos. She alleged that the defendants stole an Infinix phone valued at N50,000, from Mr. Victor Godwin, who had been missing for two weeks. Olaluwoye said Godwin was reported missing by his wife two weeks ago and the police found his car parked on Morocco Road without his phone. “My Lord, the police were able to trace the signal of the phone to the defendants; we are still carrying out an investigation to find out exactly what happened to Godwin,” she said. Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghere granted the defendants N100, 000 each with two sureties each in the like sum. She said the sureties should be employed and show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on May 8.
