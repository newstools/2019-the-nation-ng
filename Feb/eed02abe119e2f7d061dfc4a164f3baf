The Nigerian Air Force said yesterday that it has conducted air strikes on Boko Haram terrorists camp at Zanari in northern part of Borno State. Its spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement that scores of insurgents were killed during the strikes. He added that the attacks on the terrorists were carried out after intelligence reports have indicated their presence in the area. Air Commodore Daramola said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has destroyed an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists’ camp at Zanari in the northern part of Borno State. “This was achieved on 20 February 2019 in air strikes conducted sequel to intelligence reports indicating that the terrorists were using the settlement as a staging area from where they launch attacks against own ground troops’ locations. “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, which was subsequently detailed for confirmatory surveillance over the area, observed considerable terrorist activities in the settlement and therefore called for the scrambling of two Alpha Jets aircraft to attack the camp in successive strikes resulting in the destruction of several structures as well as the neutralisation of their ISWAP occupants. “The NAF operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast.”
