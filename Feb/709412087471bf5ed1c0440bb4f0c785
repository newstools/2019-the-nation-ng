Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Stanley Osifo, who defected to the ruling party a day to the eve of the postponed presidential election, has promised to deliver 15 million votes to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking to the press in Lagos, he stressed that his supporters nationwide are in support of his decision. He said: “I have consulted widely with my supporters nationwide and we saw the need to support the re-election bid of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is to officially announce my defection to the All Progressives Congress.” He explained that his movement was not necessitated by issues in PDP, but for the consistency in the fight against corruption by the ruling party, maintaining that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has demonstrated its commitment to the infrastructural development of the country, adding that the railway project that suffered decades of setback has received life.
