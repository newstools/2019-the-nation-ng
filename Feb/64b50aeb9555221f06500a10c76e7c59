The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Epe branch, has hailed the resolution of the rift between Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and members of the Lagos State House of Assembly. At a news conference yesterday, the Chairman, Prince Sunday Abimbola, praised  All Progressives Congress (APC), stalwart Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for his maturity in handling the crisis. He said: “We really appreciate the assembly for the peaceful resolution of the crisis. While we acknowledge the fact that the plan to start impeachment process was public knowledge, NBA, Epe is grateful to members of the assembly, the Speaker, in particular, the APC in Lagos State and Asiwaju Tinubu, for the wisdom used in resolving the issue.” Abimbola, advised assembly to “painstakingly” address the conflict in Section 122 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Section 22 of the Finance (Control and Management) Laws of Lagos State as to how the governor can spend part of the Appropriation Bill before same is passed into law. He explained that Section 122 gives the governor sweeping power to spend certain amount in the first six months if the Appropriation Bill is not passed.
