Despite not being a part of the top five finalists, Big Brother Naija star, Ifu Ennada is regarded as one of the most successful contestants from the ‘Double Wahala’ edition. Prior to being a contestant on the famous African reality TV show, Ifu was an upcoming actor, writer, content producer, fashion designer and TV presenter but was barely in the limelight with little or no social media prominence. Less than a year after portraying her skills, talent and abilities to the world, winning endorsement and cash prizes from Pepsi and Heritage Bank during the show, Ifu has set up her beauty business ‘beautIFU Ennada’ pioneered by her HairCare Line with distributors all over Africa and the United States. When asked how the Big Brother Naija platform helped in actualizing her dreams and goals, she said: “Big Brother Naija platform is indeed a blessing to those who know how to use it and I am very proud of everything I’ve done this far.’ “Aside from the increase in commercial value as an actor and MC, the popularity I got from the show also made it easier to make money especially with my businesses. It is the biggest platform for anyone looking to launch themselves in whatever they intend to do.” Since her exit from the show, the Computer Science graduate of Olabisi Onabanjo University has gone on to establish an empowerment Foundation for women where she recently supported two young fashion designers with sewing machines and cash. She has also partnered top brands including; Legend Extra Stout, 7UP, Pepsi, Quickteller, Access Bank, Zhenas Closet, Terra Cotta and Dukez & Duchezz. The most popular TV reality show in Africa, Big Brother Naija has no doubt continued to birth some of the greatest talents and pop culture celebrities Nigeria has ever produced in the entertainment industry since its debut in 2006. Some of these celebrities include, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, Bisola Aiyeola, Tobi Bakre, Ifu Ennada.
