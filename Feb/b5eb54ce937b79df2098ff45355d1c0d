The governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in Imo State, Uche Nwosu, has made good his promise to deliver President Muhammadu Buhari. President Buhari scored 711 at his Eziama Obire Unit 4 to defeat his closest rival and Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party ( PDP) Atiku Abubakar. It will be recalled that the Imo State chapter of the Action Alliance had promised to vote for Buhari against the decision of the National leadership of the party, which adopted Atiku instead. Meanwhile Collation is yet to begin at the Local Government Areas as a result of yesterday’s rain that wreaked havoc in polling centres across the state.
