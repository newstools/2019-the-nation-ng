Anambra South Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Andy Ubah is confident of President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory in Saturday’s election. He urged Igbo to vote for Buhari as voting against him would not stop his victory. Ubah, who addressed party faithful yesterday at a rally in Nnewi, urged them to resist the mistakes of 2015 when the party did not get enough votes in the Southeast. He said: “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari will be re-elected on Saturday. Whether you vote for him or not, he will win. “It is unfortunate that in 2015, only 10 million votes were recorded for Buhari in the Southeast. But this time, I want Anambra South alone to give him not less than 1 million votes.”
