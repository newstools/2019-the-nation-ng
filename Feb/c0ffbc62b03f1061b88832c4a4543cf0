Insurance penetration in Nigeria and other African countries remains abysmally low, Deputy Commissioner for Insurance, Technical, National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), Mr. Sunday Thomas, said at the weekend. Thomas, who spoke during Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) Business Outlook in Lagos, said the industry, during the third quarter 2018, recorded 22 per cent increase in Gross Premium Income (GPI), year-on-year to N315 billion from N258 billion recorded in the corresponding period of Q3 2017. He said the gross claim figure for the period under review increased by 30 per cent to N143 billion from N110 billion in 2017. By global standards, Africa’s insurance industry remained relatively underdeveloped, accounting for just under 1.2 per cent at $0.06 trillion of insurance premiums written globally, while Asia is $1.62 trillion, Europe $1.47 trillion and North America $1.46 trillion. He said: “Insurance penetration across majority of Africa remains very low; South Africa remains the most dominant with about 16 per cent while other large countries, such as Nigeria, remain drastically underpenetrated “Looking ahead, it is expected that global life insurance premium growth will improve over the next few years while advanced markets are expected to grow at a moderate pace, emerging markets are set to outperform, mainly driven by strong growth in China. “The global non-life sector is expected to improve, supported by advanced markets due to a solid economic environment, especially in the United States (U.S). In emerging markets, non-life premium growth will remain robust, but slightly lower than in the recent past due to less strong growth in emerging Asia and ongoing soft rates.”
