The trend of oversubscription at Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) Bond Auctions for the year continued at the February 2019 Auction conducted yesterday by the Debt Management Office (DMO). Three instruments, for 5, 7 and 10-year tenors, with a total value of N150 billion were offered but total bids received from investors for the bonds exceeded N234 billion, with a total subscription level of 156 per cent. In a statement, DMO said:  “The focus of investors was principally on the 10-year bond which had a subscription level of 392 per cent. “Successful bids were allotted at rates notably lower than those at the January 2019 Auction, with 14.52 per cent for the 5-year, 14.7999 per cent for the 7-year and 14.939 per cent for the 10-year bond. “The DMO allotted the full N150 billion offered to successful bidders across the three tenors.”
