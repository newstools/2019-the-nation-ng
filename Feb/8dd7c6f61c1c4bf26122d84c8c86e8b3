LAGOS State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday urged civil servants to start preparing for retirement early. At a training for directors and senior civil servants in Ikeja on “How to prepare for life after retirement, especially the implementation of the Contributory Pension Scheme”, he said the government would always ensure that retirees got their due through the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions and  Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC). They will also continue to receive, through other agencies more support that will add value to their lives in retirement, he added. Ambode, represented by Establishment, Training and Pensions Commissioner Dr. Akintola Benson-Oke, emphasised the need to prioritise pensioners’ welfare because of its  ‘’moral, economic, strategic and social implications.” The training, he said, was designed to ensure that public servants, especially those nearing retirement, were trained so that they could prepare for the future. “The objectives of the Pension Reform Law are: to assist persons in the employ of the state government to save towards their retirement and ensure that people who leave or retire from the public service receive their terminal or retirement benefits as and when due,” Ambode said. The facilitator of the training, Prof. Pat Utomi of the Lagos Business School, said it was necessary for every civil servant to prepare for retirement. The ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Rhoda Ayinde,  said the government organised the taining because of its  concern for its workers’ future. She said : “The government doesn’t want any of its workers to suffer during retirement, hence this training. We all know what retirement is all about. This is why the Governor Ambode administration wants us to have enough training before we retire so that we can prepare adequately.’’
