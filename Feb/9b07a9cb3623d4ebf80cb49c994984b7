The candidate of the Young Progressives Congress (YPP) for the Abi State Constituency in the Cross River House of Assembly, Lynne Oti, has said more women in politics would enhance the development of the state. Oti, from Usumutong in Abi, who spoke with The Nation in Calabar on her ambition, said her entry represents a new dawn in the politics of the state. The young aspiring lawmaker said women had shown they can make positive impact and should be given the opportunity to prove themselves. She also urged women to rise up to take their place in society so as to also contribute positively to its development. “Women are creating impact the world over and should be given a chance to also do so in our clime. They should rise up and take their place and not just be relegated to the kitchen or farm. Women should also be in the forefront of governance as they are part of the society and whatever policy of government is enforced affects them too. They should also make their contributions. “I am poised to serve my people of Abi, Cross River and Nigeria at large. I intends to change the narrative of women relegation to the background to a full time participation in various fields of endeavour in the society. “Women are the foundation of a good society. The woman is the pillar for future generations and they deserve to be given preference to participate and rule amongst men for there are more familiar with the suffering of society,” she said.
