Popular singer, Innocent Idibia, fondly called 2face, apologised to his wife, Annie Idibia, for an undisclosed reason on Monday. The message isn’t coherent as the main issue has not been addressed. However, from the looks of things, there seems to be trouble in paradise. On his verified Twitter handle, Tuface admitted that he had made a mess of things and went on to say “sorry” as well as revealing that Annie had tried her best. 2Baba wrote: “I’m sorry to say that i have fucked up so much. i have fucked up as a role model as a father and as a husband. annie im sorry. i know u tried your best.”
“Annie u have been my pillar. efe u have been a wonderful manager and ig bro. my fans have beb …. .m m” Hours before his tweet, Annie updated her Instagram story that reads: “be picky with who you invest your time in, wasted time is worse than wasted money” to which she commented that the most important lesson is learnt the hard way.  Who would have thought that she was referring to the turmoil in her marriage? 2baba and Annie started dating in 1999 but their relationship hasn’t been a walk in the park. During their off and on relationship, 2baba got two other women pregnant and in 2012, they finally tied the knot.
Annie has two children for 2face while he has five from the other women.
