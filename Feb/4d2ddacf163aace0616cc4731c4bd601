Vice Chancellor of Benson Idahosa University Prof Sam Guobadia, has enjoined the newly admitted students of the institution to desist from all forms of misconduct and embrace the virtues of Godliness and excellence. Speaking at the institution  matriculation, Prof Guobodia urged the new students to be law-abiding and respect their lecturers. His words: “I charge you all to make the most of the opportunity afforded you by your parents and guardians. Kindly ensure that you attend classes, shun all forms of deviant behaviours and other vices, and focus on why you are here. At Benson Idahosa University, we have zero tolerance for any form of misconduct, and we do not hesitate to sanction them.” Guobadia also admonished the matriculating students to be security-conscious and be wary of the friends they keep. “I wish to assure you of adequate security on both campuses of ours. We, however, plead with you not to hesitate to report any suspicious activities to the Dean of Student Affairs, security officers or indeed, any staff of the university for immediate response.” He explained that the institution has lived up to expectation since it was established, adding that discipline and academic excellence with Godliness, have been their watch words.
