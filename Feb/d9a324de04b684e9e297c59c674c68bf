Speaking in Yenagoa, Aganaba said President Muhammadu Buhari deserved his victory insisting that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had shown its commitment to the rule of law by ensuring a transparent electoral process. He said: “The February 23 presidential election is the fairest in the history of the country, no wonder it is adjudged by well-respected international election observers, to be free, fair and a vast improvement from the 2015 presidential elections. “The victory is for every patriotic Nigerian who has upheld the sacred code of honour by putting Nigeria first, above all ethnic, religious, selfish and political sentiments. “Nigerians have demonstrated their faith and preference for a corrupt-free and a stable democratic country by speaking resoundingly through the ballot box and I thank every single man, woman and youth out there for their sacrifices and commitment to democracy. “My sincere appreciation also goes to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for living up to the expectations of Nigerians and conducting a hitch -free Presidential and National Assembly polls”. Aganaba said he was confident of the President’s zeal and patriotism to continue to protect citizens, improve the economy through business and entrepreneurship development, create more jobs, renew and sustain onslaught against corruption.
