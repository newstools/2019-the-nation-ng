The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has denied rift among its leaders over the handling of campaign funds, describing media reports on the alleged rift as laughable, infantile and diversionary. A statement Monday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, accused unnamed agents of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) of having sponsored the said report. The party said for the APC and agents of the Buhari campaign to descend to the level of fabricating stories to create a non-existent scenario, showed that the APC and the Buhari Presidency have finally come to their wits end and are now suffering a pre-defeat trauma. The statement said, “The PDP is aware that the Buhari Presidency and the APC have become so frustrated over their dwindled electoral fortune in the face of the soaring popularity of the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar that they are now attempting to inject crisis into the PDP campaign in order to divert public attention from their own failures and rejection. “For President Buhari’s information, the Atiku Abubakar campaign is owned and driven by the Nigerian public and will never have the kind of rifts that have been ravaging the APC campaign, where their leaders, including their National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, went on the run from security agencies over allegations of siphoning funds from aspirants and candidates. “Unlike the Buhari Campaign Organization, which is practically a den of looters and sanctuary of persons indicted for corruption, which have been running its campaigns with looted funds, the Atiku Presidential campaign have been running a transparent and people-driven campaign, anchored on the volunteered support of overwhelming majority of Nigerians”. The main opposition party counseled President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to note that their resort to smear campaign will not help their cause. Nigerians, the PDP said, would never be distracted from their collective resolve to vote in Atiku Abubakar as the next President. The party restated its confidence in Atiku’s proven capacity and will to return the country to the path of national cohesion and economic prosperity.
