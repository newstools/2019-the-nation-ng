The New Commissioner of Police, Anambra State Command, Mustapha Dandaura, on Monday pledged his preparedness to ensure a safe environment towards hitch-free general elections in the state. He assured politicians or political parties participating in the exercise of fair and equal treatment, insisting he had no favourite candidate in the election. Addressing newsmen at the police headquarters in Amawbia, Dandaura, the 27th CP in the state, however, warned those intending to foment trouble during the exercise to steer clear or be dealt with accordingly. He said, “I’m not in Anambra to support any candidate or political party. The Nigerian police in the state will remain neutral and focused. “No political thug will be allowed access to the venue of the election. I warn all politicians that the Election Day is not a rally or campaign day. “I want to assure the people of the state that we are going to oversee a free, fair and credible poll. Those who want to disrupt the exercise will be decisively dealt with. “I also assure you that in my tenure, the state will be one of the safest states in the country.” Identifying cultism and extortion as major crimes in the state, the commissioner pledged his readiness to fight the menace to a halt. He warned officers involved in extortion or bribery to turn a new leaf or be ready to face the wrath of the law. “By the briefing I received from my senior officers, the level of cultism is gradually increasing and we’re going to face it squarely. “Robbery and other heinous crimes have subsided. With the support of the state government, the police have achieved success in crime and criminality.“
