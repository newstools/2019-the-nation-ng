The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Tuesday failed to hear the three appeals filed by suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Walter Onnoghen. The appellate court had in late January adjourned on February 12, 2019 for the hearing of the appeals. But, when lawyers to parties got to court on Tuesday, the court could not form quorum for the purpose of hearing the appeals. Parties were told to await information, on a later date, on when the hearing is to be rescheduled. The appeals are against the decisions of the Code of Conduct to assume jurisdiction over the charge pending against Onnoghen and the ex-parte injunction granted by the CCT, on which President Muhammadu Buhari acted to suspend Onnoghen.
